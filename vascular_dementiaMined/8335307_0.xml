<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karasawa's "Clinical criteria for the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>", Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale and Hachinski's ischemic score were used as a procedure to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 887 examined, 59 subjects were diagnosed to have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (6.7%) with female to male ratio being 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased with advanced age decades and sharply grew up over tha age of 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in 50 of the 59 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was re-evaluated by autopsy and/or CT scan, during a 55-month follow-up period from January 1986 to July 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coincidence rate between clinical evaluation and morphological diagnosis was 90.5% for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 62.5% for senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), and 28.6% for other or ill-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Misdiagnosis of clinical evaluation for VD was mainly due to uncertain history of head trauma, while the subjects suffering from atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> tended to be diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of the 21 cases who were initially diagnosed as having other or ill-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 8 were re-evaluated as VD, and 7 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most cases who were finally diagnosed as having VD had multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attack, while those who were classified to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> had less severely undergone <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The final type-specific prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 56% for VD, 26% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and 18% for Others, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of VD to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> was 2.2, indicating more frequent VD than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retrospective case-control study on risk factors of VD was performed using selected parameters obtained at examinations in 1973 or 1978, comparing 27 VD cases and 789 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, electro-cardiographic abnormalities (Minnesota code 3-1 and/or 4-1, 2, 3) and high hematocrit were taken as important risk factors for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These risk factors were very similar to those for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> among Hisayama residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The difficulty of epidemiologic study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in general population and the accuracy of diagnosis for type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were discussed </plain></SENT>
