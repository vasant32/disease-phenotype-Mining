<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, accompanying this rapid growth is aging of the population with increasing occurrence of diseases, of which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is the most prominent, which provide major challenges to healthcare systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence in Asia has previously been found to be lower than Western populations, but recent studies show that age-specific prevalence rates are similar globally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence is expected to rise dramatically across Asia due to maturing populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Earlier Asian studies reported a lower prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and a higher prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies, however, show a reversal of this ratio that now parallels that of Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This change may be attributed to an altered demographic profile, urbanization, environmental reactions, ethnicity and advances in the use of neuroimaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several factors may influence the results of epidemiological studies including changes in societal perception of aging, family attitudes, validity of assessment tools due to language and literacy, and medical practitioners' expertise in recognizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, epidemiological studies in Asia may reveal factors contributory to inter-ethnic differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Potentially modifiable risk factors apparent only in low and middle-income countries and gene-environment interactions may underlie these disparities and identification of such factors may lead to effective treatments </plain></SENT>
