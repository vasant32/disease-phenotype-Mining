<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SD rats were randomized into control, sham operation (sham), VD model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups, with 10 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was established by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test was performed to detect the rats' learning-memory ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor (NMDAR)-2 B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in hippocampal CA 1 region and dentate gyrus was measured by hybridization in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EA (2 Hz, 1-2 mA)was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Dazhui" (GV 14) and bilateral "Shenshu"(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 23) and non-acupoint (the chest-abdominal juncture between the first and the second lumbar vertebrae) for 20 min, once daily for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Self-comparison showed that 6 weeks after modeling, the escape latencies of control and sham groups, and the lingering duration in the 3rd quadrant of water pool of model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), while the escape latencies of model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups, and the lingering duration of control and sham groups increased considerably (P &lt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between control and sham groups, and among model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups in the escape latency and the lingering duration in the 3rd quadrant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the 11th week after modeling, compared to their individual escape latencies and lingering duration on the 6th week, the escape latencies of controll sham and acupoint groups shortened obviously (P &lt; 0.05), while the lingering duration in the 3"rd quadrant of the same 3 groups postponed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, the escape latency of acupoint group shortened obviously and the lingering duration increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between control and sham groups, and between model and non-acupoint groups in these two indexes (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared to control/sham group, the grey values of NMDAR-2 BmRNA expression in hippocampal CA 1 region and dentate gyrus in model and non-acupoint groups decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to model group, the grey values of NMDAR-2 B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in these two brain regions increased markedly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between control and sham groups, and between model and non-acupoint groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acupoint-EA is able to improve VD rats' learning-memory ability which may be related to its effect in upregulating the expression of NMDAR-2 B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in hippocampal and dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
