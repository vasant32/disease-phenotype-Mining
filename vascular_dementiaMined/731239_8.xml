<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a broad relationship between slowing of the basic frequency of the EEG and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Localised slow-wave activity was found in 19% of those with non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 72% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the ventricles, as determined from CT scans, was larger in the vascular than in the non-vascular group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the vascular group it was larger in those without than in those with visible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship in either group between ventricular size and dominant EEG frequency </plain></SENT>
