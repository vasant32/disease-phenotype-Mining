<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) in the anterior and posterior white matter and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum were significantly higher in both groups of patients than in the 12 age-matched controls, and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in VDBT and AD groups were almost the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratios, defined as diffusion restricted perpendicular to the direction of nerve fibers, were also significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there were regional differences in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratios in the two conditions, with ratios in VDBT being higher in the anterior portions of the white matter but ratios in AD were higher in the posterior portions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diffusion-weighted MRI technique may be useful in the differential diagnosis of VDBT and AD with white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
