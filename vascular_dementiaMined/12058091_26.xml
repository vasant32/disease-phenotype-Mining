<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 18 patients with SIVD, and 22 patients with AD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volumes of ERC and hippocampus were manually measured based on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global cerebral changes of cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, white matter, sulcal CSF, ventricular CSF (vCSF), and white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSH) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SIVD had 21.7% (p &lt; 0.01) smaller ERC and 18.2% (p &lt; 0.01) smaller hippocampi than cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 24.4% (p &lt; 0.01) larger ERC and 11.1% (p &lt; 0.05) larger hippocampi than patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with SIVD had less cortical gray matter and white matter and more vCSF and WMSH (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) than cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and more vCSF and WMSH (p &lt; 0.01) than patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volumes of ERC and hippocampus were positively correlated to similar extents (p &lt; 0.01) in SIVD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical gray matter loss was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.01) with hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, but not with ERC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, in SIVD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume alone could classify 82% of patients with SIVD from cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 63% of patients with SIVD from subjects with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adding global cerebral changes to hippocampus substantially improved the classification to 96% between patients with SIVD and cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 83% between subjects with SIVD and those with AD, whereas adding ERC change to hippocampus did not significantly improve the discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are less affected by subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than by AD </plain></SENT>
