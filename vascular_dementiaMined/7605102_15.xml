<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major constituent of these lesions is the cytoskeletal protein tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether the measurement of tau in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) has value in the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven subjects were enrolled in this prospective study: These included AD (N = 24), Neurological Controls (dementing diseases/syndromes, N = 26), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Controls (N = 14), and Others (N = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture, and tau concentrations (pg/mL) were determined using a dual monoclonal antibody microplate immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean tau value for AD subjects (1,430 +/- 739) was significantly different from Neurological Control subjects (790 +/- 579) (p &lt; 0.001) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Control subjects (816 +/- 355) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tau values were elevated in two Neurological Control subjects, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (age 75) and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (age 90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tau values were also elevated in three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Control subjects; two were subjects with a family history of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tau concentrations did not correlate significantly with age in AD subjects (r = 0.05, p = 0.82) or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Control subjects (r = -0.49, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tau also did not correlate with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in AD subjects (r = -0.03, p = 0.91) or duration of AD symptoms (r = 0.16, p = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and others, CSF levels of tau protein may provide a useful biochemical marker to aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
