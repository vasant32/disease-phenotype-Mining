<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following conditions were evaluated: (1) rest; (2) 60 s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>; (3) longest possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, and (4) 5 min closed-circuit air rebreathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also measured: PaCO2 levels at rest and under stimulus conditions; mean flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) at rest, and percentage velocity variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> were higher and the velocity decrease during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients than in the healthy group; no side-related asymmetry in rest values or in vasomotor responses to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> changes was regularly detected in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, rest flow velocities and vasomotor responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> induced by both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and rebreathing tests proved to be lower in MID patients than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and healthy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations were neither exclusive to MID patients nor homogeneous, therefore some caution should be taken when evaluating single cases </plain></SENT>
