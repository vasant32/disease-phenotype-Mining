<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination of the victim's brain showed characteristic pathological changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD), a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0004924'>abnormal behaviors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors methodically documented BD of the victim and at least justified the restraint as a preventive measure of his <z:mp ids='MP_0004924'>abnormal behaviors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of BD is unknown, immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein of the white matter lesions showed neither <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result suggested that astrocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
