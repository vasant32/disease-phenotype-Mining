<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> differs from that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, with greater executive/attentional dysfunction and relatively intact episodic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop brief assessment tools that are better adapted to the neuropsychological profile of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 32 subjects with ischaemic leukoaraiosis (history of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and leukoaraiosis on MRI), aged 50 to 84 years, and 17 age and education matched controls had a brief executive assessment, which took 20 minutes to administer, and a wide range of additional tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of the brief executive assessment to discriminate between groups-both individually and in combination-was evaluated and compared with that of the whole battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The brief executive assessment provided good sensitivity and specificity for identifying subjects with ischaemic leukoaraiosis (sensitivity 88%, specificity 88%, using the optimal combination of scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best individual tests were trail making and digit symbol, which were both far more sensitive than the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability to discriminate between groups was maintained in subjects with MMSE &gt; 27 and across the whole age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brief executive assessment performed well compared with the whole battery, with additional tests accounting for only a further 12% of between-group variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The brief executive assessment was sensitive to deficits found in ischaemic leukoaraiosis and discriminated them from the cognitive effects of healthy aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The assessment has potential for bedside use and as a cognitive end point for clinical trials </plain></SENT>
