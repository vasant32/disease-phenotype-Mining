<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, BD patients have long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with disturbances of gait and intellect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, we hypothesized that disturbances in the MMPs may be involved in VAD: METHODS: Brain tissues from 5 patients with VaD of the BD or multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type (MID) were immunostained with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a microglial/macrophage cell marker (PG-M1), gelatinase A (MMP-2), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and gelatinase B (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control tissues were from 8 elderly patients: 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 4 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PG-M1+ cells appeared around <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in patients with VAD: In 2 of the 3 BD patients, PG-M1 cells were prominent near damaged arterioles and scattered diffusely in white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 was seen normally in perivascular macrophages and in astrocytic processes near blood vessels and was present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 was rarely seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 was seen in PG-M1+ microglial/macrophage cells around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In BD, MMP-3 persisted in tissue macrophages and disappeared in long-standing white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that MMPs may participate in the damage to the white matter associated with VAD: Microglia/macrophage-induced damage, which is amenable to treatment, may be a factor in the progressive forms of VAD: </plain></SENT>
