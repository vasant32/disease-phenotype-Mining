<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 82 senile patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> as a complaint including 28 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), 17 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 13 mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), and 10 healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discussed the difference of scores in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the FAB, the scores of healthy persons and MCI were much higher compared with the scores of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were high correlation between FAB and MMSE, Kana-hiroi test, and RCPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although some subjects showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score in MMSE and/or RCPM, they showed low score in FAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on this, FAB is efficient for the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as brief screening tool </plain></SENT>
