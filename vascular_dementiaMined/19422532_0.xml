<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that CA represent collections of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system breakdown products that accumulate within astrocytic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In support of this, studies have shown that CA include glycosylated material, ubiquitin, and an assortment of proteins derived from neuronal cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, many of these proteins are not specifically localized to neurons or astrocytes; some components of CA, such as complement proteins, are most abundantly expressed outside the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The characteristic predilection for CA to accumulate near vessels and ependyma suggests that proteins extravasated from blood or transudated from CSF may form a component of these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the immunohistochemical localization of blood and platelet proteins thrombospondin1 and ADAMTS13 in CA from aged individuals and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombospondin1 localized to neurons, but was most prominently localized to CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An independent serum and platelet expressed protein, ADAMTS13, was found in CA in the same brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis shows that thrombospondin1 and ADAMTS13 form complexes together in cells and in direct protein binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculate that CA could result from a conglomeration of interacting proteins from degenerating neurons and from extravasated blood elements released after transient breakdown of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
