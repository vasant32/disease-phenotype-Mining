<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A representative community sample (n = 4,803 individuals, 55 + years) was interviewed in a two-phase design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Geriatric Mental Sate (GMS) was used for assessment and cases were diagnosed according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV-TR criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of non-cognitive symptoms (1 + symptoms) in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 223) was 90.1%, and negative-type symptoms were most frequently found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A GMS '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>-related symptom cluster' (anergia, restriction of activities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo>) was significantly more frequent in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (55.6%) than in non-cases (0.7%; specificity = 99.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, number of symptoms tended to be inversely related to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but psychopathological profiles differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-cognitive, negative-type symptoms are very frequent in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> living in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They have powerful specificity in the distinction with non-cases, and might change current concepts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
