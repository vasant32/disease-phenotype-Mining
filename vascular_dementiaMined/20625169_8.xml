<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Leukoaraiosis and Disability prospective multinational European study (LADIS) evaluates the impact of WMC on the transition of independent elderly subjects into disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Independent elderly were enrolled due to the presence of WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were evaluated yearly during 3 years with a comprehensive clinical protocol and a neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were classified according to usual clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed at entry and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 639 subjects were included (74.1 +/- 5 years, 55% women, 9.6 +/- 3.8 years of schooling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At end of follow-up, 90 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 147 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using Cox regression analysis, WMC severity independently predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), independently of age, education, and medial temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> at baseline was the only vascular risk factor that independently predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> during follow-up, controlling for age, education, WMC severity, and temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) was predicted only by MTA, while vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was predicted by previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, WMC severity, and MTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WMC severity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in an initially nondisabled elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is predicted by previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and WMC, while AD is predicted only by MTA </plain></SENT>
