<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, patients with a diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were randomised to receive either 400 mg naftidrofuryl/day, 600 mg naftidrofuryl/day or placebo for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were assessed using the ADAS-cog, the SCAG, the NOSGER and the CGI item 2 scale </plain></SENT>
