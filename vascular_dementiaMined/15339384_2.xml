<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NAT2 gene genotyping was performed at 7 major polymorphic loci (G191A, C282T, T341C, C481T, G590A, A803G, and G857A) with a polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism based procedure in 2 groups of farmer subjects in Shanghai suburb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 51 diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients [comprising 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) patients and 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients] and a group of 112 healthy individuals were in the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The homogenous rapid genotypes (R/R, including*4/*4, *13 /*13, and *4/*13) was found over-present in both groups of patients, compared with healthy individuals, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> farmer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, 52.9 % vs 33.0 %, P=0.016, OR (95 % CI): 2.28(1.16-4.48); for AD group only, 51.7 % vs 33.0 %, P=0.063, OR (95 % CI): 2.18 (0.95-4.97); for VD group 54.5 % vs 33.0 %, P=0.055, OR (95 % CI): 2.43 (0.96-2.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant frequency difference of genotype *4/*7B between farmer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and healthy individuals, and that of solo-alleles *13, and *7B were observed between the healthy individuals and both groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the involvement of various NAT2 rapid-acetylating genotypes in the individual susceptibility to senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variant genotypes of NAT2 might serve as a hereditary risk factor for AD and VD in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
