<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The trial consisted of a 2-week run-in phase with placebo administered once a day orally, followed by a double-blind period of 3 months, with posatirelin or placebo administered once a day intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed using the Gottfries-Br√•ne-Steen (GBS) Rating Scale (primary variable) and the Rey Memory Test (secondary variable) </plain></SENT>
