<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of cardiovascular protective effects of ghrelin and its synthetic analogs are still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our first aim was to ascertain whether or not natural and synthetic ligands of GHS-R1a are capable of interfering with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, since polymorphisms in the ACE gene have been associated with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and ACE is potentially involved in brain β-amyloid degradation, we also investigated the state of ghrelin axis and inflammatory markers in patients with AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Desacyl ghrelin, hexarelin, EP80317, and GHRP-6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly inhibited ACE activity in vitro; by comparison, the efficacies of ghrelin and MK-0677 were significantly lower, suggesting that ACE-inhibiting activity is unrelated to ligand affinity to GHS-R1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACE was capable of cleaving Aβin vitro, reducing its ability to aggregate in fibrillar Aβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this protective effect of ACE was blunted by enalapril but not hexarelin or EP80317 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Desacyl ghrelin levels were lower in VaD subjects compared with AD and control subjects, whereas ghrelin and TNF-α levels were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VaD subjects demonstrated greater levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for GHS-R1a, PPAR-γ and CD36 in peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, some GHSs are effective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi>, and this activity may contribute to their cardiovascular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hexarelin or EP80317 do not inhibit the N-domain of ACE, which is also involved in the metabolism of β-amyloid, suggesting the possibility of developing new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> with improved therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
