<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter (WM) hyperintensities on MRI or leukoaraiosis is characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased MRI signals in the anterior temporal pole are suggested to be diagnostic for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL), with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structural correlates of these specific WM hyperintensities seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences in the temporal pole of CADASIL are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed pathological changes in postmortem tissue from the temporal pole to reveal the cause of CADASIL-specific WM hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A combination of tinctorial and immunostaining approaches and in vitro imaging methods were used to quantify the extent of perivascular space (PVS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> determined as the sclerotic index, WM myelination as the myelin index, and damage within the WM as accumulated degraded myelin basic protein in samples of the anterior temporal pole from 9 CADASIL and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases, and 5 similarly aged (young) and 5 older controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Luxol fast blue-stained serial sections from a CADASIL case were also used to reconstruct the temporal pole, which was then compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Luxol fast blue sections used to reconstruct the temporal pole revealed an abundance of enlarged PVS in the WM that topographically appeared as indistinct opaque regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean and total areas of the PVS per WM area (%PVS) were significantly greater in CADASIL compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The myelin index was severely reduced in CADASIL in relation to the subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and control sample that was consistent with increased immunoreactivity of degraded myelin basic protein, indicating myelin degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microvessels associated with the PVS exhibited a 4.5-fold greater number of basophilic (hyalinized) vessels and a 57% increase in the sclerotic index values in CADASIL subjects compared to young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between the quantity of hyalinized vessels and sclerotic index values was also apparent (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MRI hyperintensities in the temporal pole of CADASIL patients are explained by enlarged PVS and degeneration of myelin accompanied by lack of drainage of the interstitial fluid rather than lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> hypersignals in the temporal pole of older subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects, our observations imply greater progression of pathological changes in CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
