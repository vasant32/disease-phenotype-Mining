<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether HFABP in CSF is a stable biomarker or if it can help predict conversion from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) to AD or VaD has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the role of HFABP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, we analyzed CSF levels of HFABP in 96 AD patients and 65 controls and also in 170 patients with MCI with an average follow up time of 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the stability analysis, two CSF samples were collected from 52 AD patients with a six month interval in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HFABP levels in CSF were very stable over the six month period (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CSF levels of HFABP were significantly elevated in AD compared with controls after adjustments for age and gender (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were also elevated in the patients with MCI that subsequently converted to AD or VaD compared with those that remained stable (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, ROC curve analysis showed that HFABP had lesser predictive value in determining conversion from MCI to AD and VaD than AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HFABP seems to be a stable CSF biomarker that reflects neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, including early stages of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
