<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine the prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to prospectively analyze a group of patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A door-to-door cross-sectional cluster survey was conducted in Kolkata, India, among those aged &gt;50 years to estimate the prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then annual assessment of cognitive function using a validated questionnaire battery was undertaken among 21 elderly individuals with memory complaints for 4 consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 53,907 persons were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crude prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0.62% (95% CI 0.44-0.84) and 1.25% (95% CI 0.87-1.74) among those &gt;50 and &gt;60 years of age, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The weighted prevalence rate among those above 50 years was 0.95% (95% CI 0.68-1.29) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, MCI remained static, converted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or reverted to normalcy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also transition from one subtype of MCI to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar outcome of MCI is also noted in Western nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Eastern India remained quite low </plain></SENT>
