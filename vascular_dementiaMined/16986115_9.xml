<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>Neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> often affect cognition, e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or different aspects of the motor system, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and ataxic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to increasing knowledge about the mechanisms leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, the development of treatments able to modify the neurodegenerative process becomes possible for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, clinical outcome measures are used to assess the efficacy of such treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, most clinical outcome measures have a low test-retest reliability and thus considerable measurement variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, large patient populations and long observation times are needed to detect treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clinical outcome measures cannot distinguish between symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, alternative biomarkers including neuroimaging may take on a more important role in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanners are widely available and allow for non-invasive detection and quantification of changes in brain structure and metabolism, there is increasing interest in the use of MRI/MRS to monitor objectively treatment effects in clinical trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Particularly volumetric MRI has been used to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> rates in treatment trials of AD because the relationship between atrophic changes and neuron loss is well established and correlates well with clinical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to determine the value of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> modalities, i.e. diffusion, perfusion and functional MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, for clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs </plain></SENT>
