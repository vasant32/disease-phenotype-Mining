<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certification for the epidemiological study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the frequency with which the condition was recorded on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates of patients diagnosed with some form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> before the age of 65 years was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A further objective was to identify variables associated with failure to record <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on the certificate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cohort of patients with presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, differentiated by a clinical algorithm applied to hospital case records, was traced through the National Health Service Central Registry and details of certified causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Northern Regional Health Authority in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Prevalent cases of presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> resident in the northern health region during 1986 traced up to April 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was recorded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in 53% of cases of clinically diagnosed presenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 33% of cases of presenile vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 10% of cases of presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> secondary to another neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was recorded in any part of the certificate in 75% of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 52% of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 33% of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, and in 65% of cases overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> or a cerebral condition of a kind that can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was recorded in 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Failure to mention <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was related to the clinical type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, shorter duration of illness, and earlier period of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> seriously understates the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but when the recording of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> is taken into account the presence of potentially dementing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> is recorded much more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that coding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in addition to those causing or contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> would improve the value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates for epidemiological purposes </plain></SENT>
