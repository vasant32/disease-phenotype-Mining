<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Swiss <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) kindred with extrapyramidal-like features and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuron disease</z:e> shows a brain pathology with ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tau and neurofilament modifications are now studied here in three recently deceased family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No major and specific decrease of tau was observed as described by others in, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of FTD with absence of tau-positive inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a slight decrease of tau, neurofilament, and synaptic proteins, resulting from frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, polymorphic markers on chromosome 17q21-22, the centromeric region of chromosome 3 and chromosome 9, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis showed several recombination events for chromosomes 3 and 17, but patients shared a haplotype on chromosome 9q21-22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However as one of the patients exhibited Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> pathology with uncertain concomitant FTD, this locus is questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data indicate principally that the Swiss kindred is unlinked to locus 17q21-22, and that tau is not at the origin of FTD in this family </plain></SENT>
