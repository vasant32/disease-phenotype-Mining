<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beyond the impact of fixed structural lesions such as infarction and white matter hyperintensities, hemodynamic dysfunction, which includes hypoperfusion and altered cerebral autoregulation, may be independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More importantly, whereas vascular-related structural pathology may produce so-called vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, disorders of blood flow and blood flow regulation may also present clinically as mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or even frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but may in fact be reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic effects may occur at the level of the cerebral hemisphere due to restricted flow through a large vessel of the neck or head, at a global level in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, or intrinsically due to dysfunction of the endothelium in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review surveys clinical, imaging, and physiological evidence for the association between hemodynamic abnormalities at these different levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
