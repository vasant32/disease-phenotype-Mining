<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of subjects â‰¥ 50 years of age residing in the Community of Biv. on January 1, 2004, and a door-to-door 2-phase design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic and biochemical analyses were done on samples collected from 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates were 0.6 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 0.4 for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 3.5 for FTD, 0.2 for Parkinson <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 1.2 for unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three GRN (1 known and 2 novel) mutations with reduced plasma protein levels were found associated to 3 distinct phenotypes (behavioral, affective, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirious</z:e> type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report an unusually high FTD prevalence in the investigated population, but a low prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We confirm the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of FTD phenotype associated with different GRN mutations </plain></SENT>
