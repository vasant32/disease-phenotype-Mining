<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred elderly with clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the urban community around Siriraj Hospital underwent cranial MRI according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and Disability in Thai Elderly Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The axial T1wi, T2wi, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) were separately assessed by two neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assessment included white matter change by using Scheltens' rating scale, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and evidence of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inter-rater agreements were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The inter-rater agreement of periventricular hyperintensities, white matter, basal ganglion and infratentorial foci of hyperintensities were very good (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.89-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The agreement was good for central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (Kw = 0.66) and moderate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> (Kw = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The silent infarction was found in the study population and divided into cortical (15%), subcortical (26%), brainstem (3%), and infratentorial infarction (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: White matter hyperintensities was an important radiological criteria for diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appropriate rating scale is necessary especially in research study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors found that Scheltens rating scale needed some training and slightly time consuming at the beginning but was a good reliable tool </plain></SENT>
