<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors administered neurologic, neuropsychological, and functional assessments to 453 patients (age 72.0 +/- 8.3 years) 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 3rd ed., revised criteria requiring deficits in memory and two or more additional cognitive domains as well as functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 119 of the 453 patients (26.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, 68 of the 119 patients (57.1%) were diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 46 patients (38.7%) were diagnosed with AD with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 5 patients (4.2%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for other reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was associated with a major hemispheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome (OR 3.0), left hemisphere (OR 2.1) and right hemisphere (OR 1.8) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> locations versus brainstem/cerebellar locations, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the pooled anterior and posterior cerebral artery territories versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in other vascular territories (OR 1.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR 1.8), prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 1.7), age 80 years or older (OR 12.7) and 70 to 79 years (OR 3.9) versus 60 to 69 years, 8 or fewer years of education (OR 4.1) and 9 to 12 years of education (OR 3.0) versus 13 or more years of education, black race (OR 2.6) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 3.1) versus white race, and northern Manhattan residence (OR 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> is frequent after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, occurring in one-fourth of the elderly patients in the authors' cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> include the location and severity of the presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and host characteristics such as older age, fewer years of education, and nonwhite race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that concomitant AD plays an etiologic role in approximately one-third of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
