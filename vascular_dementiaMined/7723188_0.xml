<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were ambulatory and were recruited from among patients having been admitted to our affiliated nursing home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of them had any serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Behavior Disturbance scale (DBD), originally developed by Baumgarten et al, and the Mini-Mental State (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) were used for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> and cognitive status, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the DAT group, a significant correlation was recognized between DBD and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the MIX group, however, DBD scores did not correlate with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients having <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores greater or equal to 20, those with MIX had higher DBD scores (mean 19.3) than those with DAT (mean 13.7), although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores in these two subgroups were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in DAT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> increase in conjunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, with the addition of cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to Alzheimer pathology, behavioral impairments may progress independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, with more frequent presentation of troublesome behaviors in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
