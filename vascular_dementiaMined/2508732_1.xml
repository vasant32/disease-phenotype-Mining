<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded coronal sections of the brains at the level of the lateral geniculate body were immunohistochemically stained with the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex procedure, using the anti-bodies to tau protein purified from human brains (anti-tau) as the primary antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFTs) which were specifically and selectively stained by anti-tau were semiquantitatively counted in the areas of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: 1) In non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, NFTs in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were scanty in the 50 s: they increased markedly after 60 years until 90 as the patients' age increased; they tended to decrease over 90 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NFTs in the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus remained none or scanty, always less than 10/mm2 field, throughout the ages between 50 s and 100 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) In DAT cases, NFTs in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were numerous in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases at any ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NFTs in the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus were also many, and always more than 10/mm2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except a few ones over 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of NFTs of the three areas were significantly higher in DAT cases than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3) In most cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the density and distribution pattern of NFTs were essentially similar to those of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
