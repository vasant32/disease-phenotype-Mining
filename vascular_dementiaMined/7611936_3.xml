<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The scores in the neuropsychological tests were compared to those obtained by thirty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers paired for age, sex and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the tests in the distinction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracies were calculated using ROC curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blessed's information-memory-concentration test showed greatest accuracy, followed by copy of simple figures, delayed memory of 10 figures (after 5 minutes), recognition of 10 figures and verbal fluency test (animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear discriminant function, composed by 6 tests: visual perception, incidental memory, delayed memory (after 5 minutes), drawing of a clock, verbal fluency (animals) and calculation tests, was able to discriminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls from patients and only one patient was wrongly classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These tests were chosen because they can be applied in less than 10 minutes and are very easy to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This discriminant function must be applied in another group of patients and controls in order to demonstrate its value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When associated to the MMSE it may be useful to discriminate patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
