<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, expression levels of HO and NOS in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated using Western immunoblotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression level of inducible HO-1 in hippocampus of 4-wk prehypertensive SHR was about twofold of that in age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 23-wk SHR with fully developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hippocampal HO-1 level was significantly greater than that of age-matched SD rats (p &lt; 0.05), but not different from 4-wk SHR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although hippocampal expression of nNOS protein was relatively unchanged, iNOS expression in 23-wk SHR was about fourfold lower than that in age-matched SD rats and 4-wk SD/SHR (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
