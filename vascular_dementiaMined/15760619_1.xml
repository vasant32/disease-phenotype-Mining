<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe the morphological alterations of the acoustic cortex in five cases, which fulfilled the clinical, neuropsychological and laboratory diagnostic criteria of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The morphological alterations, seen in Golgi technique and electron microscopy concerned the capillaries, the dendritic arborization of the neurons, the astrocytes and the cytoarchitecture of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurons showed an impressive abbreviation of the dendritic fields and loss of spines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytic proliferation was seen in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The layer I showed marked decline of Cajal-Retzius cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the synapses demonstrated changes in size and shape of the pre- and postsynaptic components and alterations of the organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphological alterations of the acoustic cortex in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be associated with the impairment of the verbal communication, which is not an uncommon phenomenon even in the early stages of the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
