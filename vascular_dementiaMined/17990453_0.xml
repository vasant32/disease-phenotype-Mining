<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment with compound Reinhartdt and Sea Cumber Capsule (RSC, a Chinese medicinal preparation consisted mainly of Reinhartdt and Sea Cumber) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and its effect on thyroid function axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three patients with VD were treated respectively with RSC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> and the combined treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMSE, ADAS-Cog and ADL scales were used to evaluate the condition of patients before treatment as well as at 3 months and 6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, levels of thyroid hormones, including (TSH, FT3, FT4, TT3, TT4) were measured with radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with the baseline, MMSE score increased, ADAS-Cog score and ADL score decreased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three groups after 3 months and 6 months of treatment (P &lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), the improvement in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> group was more significant than that in the RSC group after 6 months of treatment (P &lt; 0.05), but the combined treatment group showed the best efficacy (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of treament, the levels of FT3 and FT4 in the combined treatment group increased, but showed no statistical significance (P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, significant changes were found at 6 months after combined treatment (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were seen at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in levels of TSH, TT3 and TT4 (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FT3, FT4 increased without statistical significance after 6 months <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> treatment, TSH, TT3 and TT4 also showed no significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> group and no other significant changes of thyroid hormones was seen in patients treated with RSC (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No obvious adverse reaction occurred in any of the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of RSC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> was effective and safe on VD patient, with the efficacy much better than either of them alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant adverse reaction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The regulation on thyroid hormones may one of the mechanisms of the combined treatment in improving cognitive function </plain></SENT>
