<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Seven-year longitudinal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three-City Study, a French prospective study designed to evaluate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> attributable to vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand four hundred eighty community-dwelling persons aged 65 to 95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: An expert committee established a clinical diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frailty was defined as having at least three of the following criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline were excluded from analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were used to evaluate the relationship between frailty and incident VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 6.5% of participants were classified as frail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 7 years of follow-up, 54 persons were diagnosed with VaD, seven of whom where frail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the proportional hazards models, frailty was marginally associated with greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and was not associated with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but frailty status was independently associated with incident VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frailty is a major risk factor for incident VaD, so its identification could contribute to better estimates of the risk of VaD in elderly adults </plain></SENT>
