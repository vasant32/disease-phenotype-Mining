<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Performance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task and the passive avoidance task were examined one year after WBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, histological and immunohistochemical examinations using antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament (NF) were performed of the rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The irradiated rats continued to gain weight 7 months after WBR whereas the control rats stopped gaining weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions in both the water maze task and the passive avoidance task were lower in the irradiated rats than in the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain damage consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> only or with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found mainly in the body of the corpus callosum and the parietal white matter near the corpus callosum in the irradiated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination of the brains without <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> found MBP-positive fibers were markedly decreased in the affected areas by irradiation; NF-positive fibers were moderately decreased and irregularly dispersed in various shapes in the affected areas; and GFAP-positive fibers were increased, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in those areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are similar to those in clinically accelerated brain aging in conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
