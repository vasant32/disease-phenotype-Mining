<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a sample of 343 Southern Brazilian participants, CDR was consecutively assessed in 295 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and questionable) and 48 healthy elderly </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of cognitive tests and the Mini Mental State Examination (as a screening test at study entry) were also applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were obtained through contingency tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validity and reliability were measured through kappa coefficient, Kendall b, and percent agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CDR agreement among raters was demonstrated by percent agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement to gold standard was good (kappa=0.75), as well as to the Blessed scale (kappa=0.73), and excellent to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III-R (kappa=0.78) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, agreement of CDR global score with the gold standard was good, and diagnostic values were high </plain></SENT>
