<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mounting lab data had suggested that electro-acupuncture could alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and restore long term potentiation of hippocampus in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data also indicated that electro-acupuncture could improve electrical activity of brain in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its biological basis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects on hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) remain not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> electro-acupuncture (acupoints: ST36 and SP6; continuous wave, 2 mV, 2Hz; lasted 20 min) could enhance LTP of perforant path-dentate gyrus granule cells in anesthetized rat and explore its underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that electro-acupuncture could significantly increase PS2/PS 1 in pair pulse test (P &lt;0.05, inter-pulse interval: 20ms and 90ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared to control group, electro-acupuncture could significantly enhance LTP to about 234% which was about 143% of that in control group (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It suggested that electro-acupuncture could modulate the function of interneurons in hippocampus hence increase LTP </plain></SENT>
