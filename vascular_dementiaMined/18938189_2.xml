<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we observed the effect of acupuncture on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in hippocampus of cerebral multi-infarction rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that acupuncture significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by cerebral multi-infarction, as evaluated by shortened escape latency and increased swimming time in the target quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, based on the observation in hippocampal CA1 region through methods of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL), immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, acupuncture decreased the number of apoptotic cells and expression of the proapoptotic Bax gene, on the contrary, it increased expression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result of the research suggested that acupuncture can exert antiapoptotic effect through counter-regulating Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression </plain></SENT>
