<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reported results concern data obtained at the moment of recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied 42 patients with a history of non valvular AF (paroxysmal, persistent, recurrent or permanent) and 40 homogenous controls in sinus rhythm without previous AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical and instrumental tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cognitive status, subjects underwent the following neuropsychological rating scales: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (CDR),Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) Global Deterioration Scale (GLDS), Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (GDS) and Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AF Patients had worse scores versus controls at GLDS (P=0.0001), HIS (P=0.001), CDR (P=0.07) and GDS (P=0.07); no significant differences were found for MMSE even after correction for age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF patients treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> showed better scores at CDR (P=0.04),GLDS (P=0.03) and GDS (P=0.007), compared to those in aspirin-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corrected MMSE scores did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors identified a slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the AF group; patients with paroxysmal, persistent or recurrent AF showed worse cognitive performances than permanent ones, suggesting a possible microembolic pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy could play a protective role, however more evidence is needed </plain></SENT>
