<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past years, the possible involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been the subject of several investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there are restricted data about the profile of the inflammatory and soluble proteins in well evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are also no reliable data regarding the relationship between the overlapping protein levels and cognitive or functional decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-alpha, beta-Amlyloid 1-40 and alpha1-antichymotrypsin levels in plasma in groups of total 82 subjects with AD, MCI, VD and controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study samples showed high levels of proinflammatory cytokine levels (especially IL-18) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups but only high levels of alpha1-antichymotrypsine in VD patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no significant correlation between the laboratory and clinical variables except for a link between IL-1beta and NPI scores of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study yielded evidence of some shared mechanisms underlying AD and VD and thus motivates further studies of inflammatory markers in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI </plain></SENT>
