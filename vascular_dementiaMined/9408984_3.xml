<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the present study patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were treated with an infusion therapy using the neurotrophic drug Cerebrolysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the therapy was examined under conditions of daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 645 Patients were treated with 30 ml Cerebrolysin daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average period of treatment was 17.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to treatment patients were diagnosed according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition a differential diagnostic examination using the Hachinski Ischemic Score was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were determined before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebrolysin therapy led to a significant (p &lt; 0.001) improvement in memory for 62% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>65% showed improvement in concentration, 50% in mood and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and 47% improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An improvement in the Clinical Global impression was observed in approximately 80% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement of symptoms was significantly larger (p &lt; 0.05) in younger, less afflicted patients than in the older, more seriously ill patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The unusual good tolerance of Cerebrolysin was especially noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the results of earlier clinical studies with Cerebrolysin in the treatment of Alzheimer patients and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in which similar responder rates were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The significant dependence of therapeutic success on the length and severity of illness confirms that timely pharmacological intervention leads to best therapeutic results </plain></SENT>
