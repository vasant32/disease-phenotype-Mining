<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are present during the years preceding a diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to (1) extend previous research by examining whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are already present 6 years before diagnosis, and (2) examine the strength of the association between cognitive performance and a future VaD diagnosis after controlling for previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects from a population-based study of very old persons (&gt; or =75) were examined with a test of global cognitive functioning (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) at 3 occasions over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study sample was nondemented the first 2 measurement times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the last occasion, 22 individuals were diagnosed with VaD, and 450 persons remained nondemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The preclinical VaD group showed no MMSE deficits 6 years before diagnosis (P&gt;0.10) compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 3 years before diagnosis, poor cognitive performance was significantly associated with forthcoming VaD after controlling for demographic factors and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study extends previous findings on preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in VaD and suggests that cognitive measures can be useful in the process of recognizing individuals at risk for developing VaD to initiate early treatment </plain></SENT>
