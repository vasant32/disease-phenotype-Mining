<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe multi-focal delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of rat brain after transient regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by embolization of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After sixty minutes of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, recirculation was achieved by removal of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chronological changes in the distribution of the neuronal damage were determined by using the 45Ca autoradiographic technique and the histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 45Ca accumulation extended to the lateral segment of the caudate putamen and the cerebral cortex supplied by the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, three days after ischemic insult, 45Ca had accumulated in the ipsilateral thalamus and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed that the neurons in both area suffered damage and were selectively reduced in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both areas lie outside the ischemic area, but have transsynaptic connections with the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the postischemic delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in exo-focal remote areas may be caused by a transsynaptic process associated with the infarcted areas and that these delayed multi-focal brain damage may exacerbate clinical symptoms in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
