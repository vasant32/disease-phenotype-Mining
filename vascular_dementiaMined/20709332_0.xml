<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clarifying the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is of crucial importance in the management of patients as well as for research purposes but it is not always possible clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore the identification of biological markers should complement clinical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening is emerging as an important mechanism in vascular aging and the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, telomere length could be a potential candidate to accurately separate vascular from degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of telomere length alone or combined with ApoE polymorphism in diagnosing mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) from vascular (VaD) and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed by flow cytometry in 439 patients (mean age, 85.1 years): 204 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 187 demented patients: 80 AD, 86 MD, and 21 with VaD; and 48 patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple and multiple ordered logistic regressions were used to predict the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from telomere length, ApoE polymorphism and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ApoEε4 was statistically associated with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) compared to cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or MCI patients; but not with the aetiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD, VaD and MD) (p=0.385) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in telomere length were found among patients with different aetiologies or severities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the global model, the combination of telomere length and ApoE polymorphism did not confer a significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.69-1.32; p=0.784) than APOEε4 alone (OR=2.12, 95% CI=1.15-3.9; p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This longitudinal study in very old patients provided no evidence suggesting that telomere length alone could be used to distinguish between the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or MCI, nor combined with the ApoE polymorphism </plain></SENT>
