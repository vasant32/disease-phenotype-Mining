<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Randomised, controlled trials and population studies have suggested a link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>) although the results are not conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The very elderly are at highest risk for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but have been underrepresented in studies to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication for those &gt; or =80 years of age, is currently underway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol for the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and detection of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases is described in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this protocol is to determine whether treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this very elderly group affects the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and decline in cognitive function during the period of the HYVET trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cognitive function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HYVET trial participants is assessed at baseline and annually thereafter using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An MMSE score that decreases more than three points per year or decreases to &lt;24 prompts further investigation for possible incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This includes use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria, the modified Hachinski scale and CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cases where a CT scan cannot be obtained the full Hachinski scale is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional information is provided when available from the clock drawing test and Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data are also gathered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trial participants with regard to education, blood pressure, alcohol use, co-morbidities and concomitant treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the end of the trial, changes in cognitive function and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases will be compared in those receiving active treatment (indapamide slow-release +/- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>) and those receiving matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protocol has been applied successfully and the data collection phase is underway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Previous population studies have been unable to study <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> use in a controlled manner and randomised, controlled trials suggest a positive or mixed picture regarding an association between use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and reduction in incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No such trial has yet been performed exclusively in subjects &gt; or =80 years of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The HYVET trial is placebo controlled and while investigating the cardiovascular effect of treatment also assesses cognitive function and quality of life in both the placebo and actively treated arms of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The HYVET cognitive substudy trial (HYVET-COG) design has been successfully applied and the instruments chosen appear to be appropriate, valid and pragmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HYVET-COG provides the first opportunity to examine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment on incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a high-risk very elderly population </plain></SENT>
