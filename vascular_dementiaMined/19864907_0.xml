<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin (FN) exerts a strong angiogenic influence on endothelial cells in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study the expression of the plasma fibronectin molecular forms in an Alzheimer patient group, compared with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and age-matched control groups was analyzed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FN in the plasma of the elderly individuals with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> exists as a mixture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> molecules with increasing molecular masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apart from the wide approximately 240-kDa and approximately 220-kDa FN bands, normally present in plasma, the high molecular FN forms having approximately 280 kDa and approximately 320 kDa appeared in the plasma of the Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group more frequently and at the higher amounts than in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and age-matched nondemented groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma FN molecular status seems to be a molecular additional biomarker for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
