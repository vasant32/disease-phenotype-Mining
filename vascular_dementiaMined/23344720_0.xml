<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with SAE, the differentiation of VP from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> (IPS) is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> transporter (DAT) density in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> and SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen consecutive patients with parkinsonian symptoms displayed SAE, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen retrospectively chosen, matched patients with diagnosis of IPS without any abnormalities in MRI served as a reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAT SPECT was performed using the tracer (123)I-FP-CIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scans were acquired on a triple-head SPECT system (Multispect 3, Siemens) and analysed using the investigator-independent BRASS™ software (HERMES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the SAE group, a DAT deficit was observed in 9/15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from the IPS group showed a reduced DAT binding (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific binding ratios (BR) of putamen contralateral to the side of the more affected limb versus occipital lobe were in trend higher in patients with SAE versus patients in the IPS-group (p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indices for putaminal asymmetry (p = 0.036) and asymmetry caudate-to-putamen (p = 0.026) as well as the ratio caudate-to-putamen (p = 0.048) were significantly higher in IPS patients having no SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DAT deficit was less pronounced in patients with SAE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> than in patients with IPS without any abnormalities in the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A potential role of DAT SPECT in the differential diagnosis of VP and IPS requires more assessments within prospective studies </plain></SENT>
