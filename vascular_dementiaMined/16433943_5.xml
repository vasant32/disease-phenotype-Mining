<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines differences between individuals diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD; n = 25) versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD; n = 23) on the Naturalistic Action Test (NAT; Schwartz et al., 2003), a performance-based measure that includes three tasks of increasing complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of task steps accomplished, number of errors, and performance times were recorded for each task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the groups did not differ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity or overall impairment on the NAT, the VaD group committed more errors (3.3 vs. 1.6, p = 02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VaD group also accomplished significantly fewer steps when salient distractor objects were present (74.0% vs. 91.3%, p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between NAT variables and neuropsychological tests suggest the executive control deficits associated with VaD may contribute to specific action difficulties, such as distractor interference and inefficient, error-prone action on complex tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AD, everyday action may be negatively influenced by episodic memory failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis has relevance to everyday function </plain></SENT>
