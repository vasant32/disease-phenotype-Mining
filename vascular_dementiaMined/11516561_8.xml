<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An ongoing longitudinal study in Maracaibo, Venezuela, examined the interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), evaluating age and gender as potential modifiers of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, carriers of at least one epsilon4 allele were at higher risk for AD, not for VD; however, the risk was significant only for subjects older than 65, and it increased 10-fold in subjects older than 85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of AD conferred by APOE-epsilon4, adjusted for age and stratified by gender, was significant only for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the epsilon-2 allele and AD or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results support the notions that APOE-epsilon4 is relevant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>, not early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD, and that age and gender act as modulators of this association </plain></SENT>
