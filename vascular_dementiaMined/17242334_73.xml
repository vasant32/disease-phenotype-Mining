<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of conversion to Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) between subtypes of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) in a community-based birth cohort investigated at age 75 and followed up after 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Vienna Trans-Danube Aging Study investigated every inhabitant of the area on the left shore of the river Danube who was born between May 1925 and June 1926 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With use of the official voting registry, 1505 subjects were contacted and 697 participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data refer to the cohort of 581 nondemented individuals who completed extensive neuropsychological examination at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up after 30 months was possible in 476 probands (35 deceased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 141 patients with MCI at baseline were classified into two subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 41 of these patients with MCI were diagnosed with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversion rates to AD were 48.7% (CI: 32.4 to 65.2) for amnestic MCI and 26.8% (CI: 17.6 to 37.8) for nonamnestic MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another 49 AD cases originated from cognitive health at baseline (12.6%; CI: 9.4 to 16.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) showed a high probability to be diagnosed with Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) after 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subtypes of MCI were not useful in defining early stages of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: Not only amnestic MCI but also nonamnestic MCI converted frequently to AD, and conversion to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> was not restricted to nonamnestic MCI </plain></SENT>
