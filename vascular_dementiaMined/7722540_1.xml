<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test whether alterations of the humoral immunity may lead to endothelium damage, we analyzed serum levels of anti-brain endothelium antibodies (ABEA) (IgG and IgM) in 16 BE patients, 19 subjects with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo> and 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABEA IgM were found elevated in 1/16 (6%) BE patients and in 4/19 (21%) patients with cerebrovascular diseases; an increase in ABEA IgG was found in 6/16 (38%) BE patients and in 7/19 (37%) cerebrovascular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was found in 50% of BE patients with elevated ABEA and only 10% of those with no increase, whereas high titres of anti-neurofilament antibodies (1:10,000) were detected in 40% and 71% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BE, ABEA IgG but not IgM showed a trend, although not significant, towards a correlation with the duration of the disease (rs = 0.47; p = 0.07) and significantly correlated with the cognitive function as assessed by the Mini mental state (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) score (rs = 0.56; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher mean values of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> score were found in BE patients with elevated ABEA than in those without (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was not due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023015" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">language disorders</z:e> neither to an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors or anti-neurofilament antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores between cerebrovascular patients with ABEA and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A "neuro-protective" role is hypothesized for the ABEA in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in BE </plain></SENT>
