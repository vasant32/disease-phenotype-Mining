<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model group, the low-frequency rTMS group, and the high-frequency rTMS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-vessel occlusion was employed to make VaD models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-frequency rTMS group rats were treated with 0.5 Hz rTMS for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-frequency rTMS group rats underwent 5 Hz rTMS for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> was carried out to detect the ability of spatial learning and memory of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultra-structural changes of synapses in four groups were observed by transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NMDAR1, and Synaptophysin (SYN) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and proteins in hippocampal CA1 area were determined by real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After rTMS treatment, the learning and memory abilities of VaD rats improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ultra-structures of synapses in hippocampal CA1 area in rTMS groups were reformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of BDNF, NMDAR1, and SYN in the low-frequency rTMS group and in the high-frequency rTMS group were higher than that in VaD model group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rTMS plays an important and beneficial role in the restoration treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which may be related to the mechanism that rTMS can increase the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of BDNF, NMDAR1, and SYN and affect the synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 area </plain></SENT>
