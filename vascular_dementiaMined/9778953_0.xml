<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) has been reported to be the commonest subtype A report from Tokyo in 1970 showed that it was 2.8 times more frequent than Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a rural area (population: 12,931, 25.3% were 65 years or older in 1994) in Kyoko </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we questioned subjects about their demographic circumstances, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo>) and daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our questionnaire was answered by 3.132 (95.8%) subjects, and 2,280 of them agreed to be examined by neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who met the appropriate criteria of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R and NINCDS-ADRDA were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By use of the Hachinski ischemic score (HIS), we distinguished VD from non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study patients with non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> by the neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data revealed that 4.8% of the study population was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the HIS results, only 3 of 15 had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the same as the average prevalence in Japan even though the elderly population of this town was twice as high as the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is hard to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in any community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many factors must be taken into consideration: the coverage rate, the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and whether to include institutionalized residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> will increase with the aging of the population, and we must collect accurate data in order to plan efficiently </plain></SENT>
