<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence suggests that structural and functional brain reserves, thought to develop in childhood and adolescence, may be crucial in determining when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> begins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to examine the relationship of height, as a marker of childhood development, to late-life cognitive function in a sample of elderly Japanese-American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Cognitive performance was assessed from 1991 to 1993 in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study in 3733 men aged 71 to 93 years and related to height that was measured 25 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the study sample, shorter men were older, leaner, and less educated than taller men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shorter men also spent more years of their childhood living in Japan and were more likely to have had fathers in unskilled professions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, the prevalence of poor cognitive performance declined consistently with increasing height from 25% in men shorter than 154 cm (61 in) to 9% in those taller than 174 cm (69 in) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not alter the association between height and cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 was unrelated to height and did not effect the association between height and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was higher in men who were 154 cm (61 in) or shorter as compared with men who were taller (4.7% vs 2.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between height and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Efforts to improve prenatal and early life conditions to maximize growth in childhood and adolescence could diminish or delay the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> that occur later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention of some late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> may have pediatric origins </plain></SENT>
