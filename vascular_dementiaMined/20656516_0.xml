<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrolysin has a long record of safety and might be efficacious in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 242 patients meeting the criteria for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the combined outcome of cognition (based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart, Extended Version [ADAS-cog+] score) and overall clinical functioning (based on Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input [CIBIC+] score) assessed after 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous Cerebrolysin 20 mL was administered once daily over the course of 2 treatment cycles as add-on therapy to basic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of Cerebrolysin was associated with significant improvement in both primary parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 24, ADAS-cog+ score improved by 10.6 points in the Cerebrolysin group, compared with 4.4 points in the placebo group (least squares mean difference, -6.17; P &lt; .0001 vs placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CIBIC+ showed a mean improvement of 2.84 in the treatment arm and 3.68 in the placebo arm, a treatment difference of 0.84 (P &lt; .0001 vs placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by responder analyses demonstrating higher rates in the Cerebrolysin group (ADAS-cog+ improvement of â‰¥4 points from baseline, 82.1% vs 52.2%; CIBIC+ score of &lt;4 at week 24, 75.3% vs 37.4%; combined response in ADAS-cog+ and CIBIC+, 67.5% vs 27.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For Cerebrolysin, the odds ratio for achieving a favorable CIBIC+ response was 5.08 (P &lt; .05), and that for achieving a favorable combined response was 5.63 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the addition of Cerebrolysin significantly improved clinical outcome, and that the benefits persisted for at least 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrolysin was safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
