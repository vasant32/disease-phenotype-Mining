<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, the preventive strategy of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, one of the challenge problems of elderly, has received attention due to the limitation of therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to determine the protective effect and possible mechanism of action of mulberry fruit extract on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and brain damage in animal model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats, weighing 300-350 g, were orally given mulberry extract at doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg at a period of 7 days before and 21 days after the occlusion of right middle cerebral artery (Rt.MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that rats subjected to mulberry fruits plus Rt.MCAO showed the enhanced memory, the increased densities of neuron, cholinergic neuron, Bcl-2-immunopositive neuron together with the decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data together, the cognitive enhancing effect of mulberry fruit extract observed in this study might be partly associated with the increased cholinergic function and its neuroprotective effect in turn occurs partly via the decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mulberry fruit is the potential natural cognitive enhancer and neuroprotectant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, further researches are essential to elucidate the possible active ingredient </plain></SENT>
