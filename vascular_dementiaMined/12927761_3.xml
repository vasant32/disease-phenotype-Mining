<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since this test was first reported, there have been studies suggesting it cannot provide a differential diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study re-evaluated the pupillary dilation of AD (n=17) and non-AD (n=20) subjects at a 0.01% concentration of tropicamide and found that non-AD subjects, including young subjects, showed the same extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>pupil dilation</z:mp> as AD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the average dilation rate of the two groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the tropicamide concentration was diluted to half of the initial concentration and performed for AD (n=14), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) (n=14), and young (n=16) subjects, the AD subjects showed a large dilation (mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>pupil dilation</z:mp> rate: 133.8+/-15%) while the non-AD subjects did not show hypersensitivity to the new concentration of eye drops (105.4+/-9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences in pupillary dilation between AD and non-AD patients were statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the most effective cutoff point of 0.005% tropicamide for differential diagnosis was 114.5% of the average <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>pupil dilation</z:mp> rate for 60 min </plain></SENT>
