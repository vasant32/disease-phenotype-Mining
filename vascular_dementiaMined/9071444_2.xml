<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 105 demented elderly (83 +/- 6 years), 37% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type and 58% with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were relocated by the municipal care planning team after clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An observational scale (the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029221" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Organic Brain Syndrome</z:e> scale) was used to assess confusional symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physical environment was assessed by an architect using the Therapeutic Environment Screening Scale, which evaluates general design, space, lighting, noise, communication area, floor plan, and related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less than 15% of the patients had no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003635" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dyspraxia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233777" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hallucinosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at admission, whereas 66% or more reported lack of vitality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen out of 18 units had a corridor-like design (group A), one unit an L-shaped design (group B), and the others a square or H-shaped design (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients living in the B unit had less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> than the others at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, the patients in the A units had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003635" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dyspraxia</z:e>, lack of vitality, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> of identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The communication areas in the units were negatively associated with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> for recent memory" and "lack of vitality," adjusted for type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (r = -0.13 to -0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The size of the activity area, indoor public rooms in square meters, was not correlated to confusional reactions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a GL unit design that facilitates perception without reducing the communication area is to be preferred </plain></SENT>
