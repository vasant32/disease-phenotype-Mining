<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The possibility of brain volume reserve effects was examined in a sample of geriatric outpatients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total intracranial volume (ICV) served as an estimate of the maximum attained brain volume in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects (n = 181, mean age 60.7) were consecutive referrals to a geriatric outpatients clinic (n = 96) and a group of age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICV and brain volume were attained from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images using a stereological method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was assessed with a visual rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICV was significantly smaller in patients with AD and VaD than in control subjects, but effect size was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and gender, having ICV in the smallest quartile significantly increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (either MCI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not in MCI, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and ICV were moderately correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of ICV on cognition was not mediated by hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with volume reserve effects that modify the clinical expression of symptoms in both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They may have implications for the design of neuroimaging studies that use ICV for normalization procedures </plain></SENT>
