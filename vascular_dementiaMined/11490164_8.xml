<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from 10 incidence studies are compared to those of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging using age-standardized incidence ratios (SIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SIRs vary from 0.42 to 2.68, indicating that geographical variation is still present after taking into account the countries' differential age distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is still unclear if these differences are due to genetic and/or environmental factors since a large part reflects methodological differences between studies </plain></SENT>
