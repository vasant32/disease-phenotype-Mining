<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, adequate characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and characterize the neuropsychological impairment in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> English-speaking participants in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> (SPS3) trial (National Clinical Trial 00059306) underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raw scores were converted to z scores using published norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with impairment (z â‰¤ -1.5) in memory and/or nonmemory domains were classified as having mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 1,636 participants, average z scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests were &lt; 0, with the largest deficits seen on tests of episodic memory (range of means, -0.65 to -0.92), verbal fluency (mean, -0.89), and motor dexterity (mean, -2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent were classified as having MCI (36% amnestic, 37% amnestic multidomain, 28% nonamnestic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those with modified Rankin score 0-1 and Barthel score = 100, 41% had MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger age (odds ratio [OR] per 10-year increase, 0.87), male sex (OR, 1.3), less education (OR, 0.13-0.66 for higher education levels compared to 0-4 years education), poststroke disability (OR, 1.4), and impaired activities of daily living (OR, 1.8) were independently associated with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In this large, well-characterized cohort of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, MCI was present in nearly half, including many with minimal or no physical disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may commonly be overlooked in clinical practice but may be as important as motor and sensory sequelae </plain></SENT>
