<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered one of the best disease preventive foods, based on its potent and varied effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Midlife risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, such as high serum total cholesterol, raised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, increased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation, <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp>, impaired fibrinolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002160'>homocystinemia</z:hpo> are important risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in later years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These risk factors play a major role in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of vital arteries causing both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Garlic is best known for its <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering and anti-atherogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms of action include inhibition of the hepatic activities of lipogenic and cholesterogenic enzymes that are thought to be the genesis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e>, increased excretion of cholesterol and suppression of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> caused by increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties of garlic and its different preparations including Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AGE and S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30361">allyl</z:chebi>-cysteines (SAC), a bioactive and bioavailable component in garlic preparations have been shown in a number of in vitro studies to protect neuronal cells against beta-amyloid (A) toxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the broad range of anti-atherogenic, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-apoptotic protection afforded by garlic may be extended to its neuroprotective action, helping to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
