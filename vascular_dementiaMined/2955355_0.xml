<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and computerized tomography (CT) have become indispensable to the exploration of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NMR is remarkable for its innocuity, its anatomical accuracy, its sensitivity and the three-dimensional approach it offers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT is less sensitive, but the examinations are shorter and less costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two techniques seem to be about equally effective in visualizing multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, although NMR gives a better contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, the bilateral cortical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> coexist with moderate cortical trophy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral lacunae of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are better visualized by NMR; they are distributed on both sides, predominate in the frontal lobes and only produce slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, less pronounced than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main advantage of NMR is its high sensitivity in detecting early changes in the white matter, changes which are particularly perceptible in juxta- and periventricular areas in arteriosclerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical leucoencephalopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NMR, not very specific here, does not readily separate these lesions from those of other types of leucoencephalopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding of hypodense areas at CT or of hypersignals at NMR (T2) around the ventricles may help in differentiating between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, irrespective of its mechanism, and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
