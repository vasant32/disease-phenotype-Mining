<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Hisayama Study, in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-three participants with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> samples from a population of 1,073 community-dwelling participants without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> aged 60 to 79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The risk estimates of the APOE-ɛ4 allele on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 17 years of follow-up, 136 participants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 81 of whom had AD and 39 VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol intake, systolic blood pressure, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, serum total cholesterol, body mass index, and regular exercise, the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD were significantly higher in APOE-ɛ4 carriers than in noncarriers, but no such association was observed for VaD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: hazard ratio (HR)=1.81, P=.004; AD: HR=3.42, P&lt;.001; VaD: HR=1.08, P=.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly greater when the APOE genotype was incorporated into a model with potential risk factors for AD (0.74 vs 0.68, P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other measures of model discrimination (net reclassification improvement: 0.18, P=.01; integrated discrimination improvement: 6.25, P&lt;.001) also confirmed this improvement in AD risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The APOE-ɛ4 allele is a risk factor for AD in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Information on APOE genotype improves AD risk assessment substantially beyond a model based on potential risk factors </plain></SENT>
