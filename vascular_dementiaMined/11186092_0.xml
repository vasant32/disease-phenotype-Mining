<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with normotensive control rats, SHRSP exhibited an impaired sleep pattern characterized by suppressed diurnal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and excessive nocturnal non-REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a dose of 30 mg/kg per day p.o., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> increased REM sleep in the light period after administration for 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, suppressed REM sleep in SHRSP was restored by repeated treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">Aniracetam</z:chebi> could be useful in improving REM sleep impairment associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
