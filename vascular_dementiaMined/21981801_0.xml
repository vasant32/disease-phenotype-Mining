<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ameliorated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> model animals, independently of its anti-hypertensive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we again investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> on cognitive function in a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model animal, comparing it with other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also determined ACE activity in the brain and extracellular <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) concentration in the perirhinal cortex in order to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the effects of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">Perindopril</z:chebi> was suggested to be more centrally active than imidapril and enalapril, in consideration of the relative distribution of their active metabolites in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This property was at least partially attributed to the lipophilicity of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the 3 day treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, imidapril or enalapril lowered blood pressure to the same level in spontaneous hypertensive rats, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> reversed the decline in the recognition index in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebral hypo-perfusion rats, regarded as an animal model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, during an object recognition task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the same dosing regimen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> inhibited the brain ACE activities of rats more than imidapril or enalapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a single treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> enhanced the extracellular level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> in the perirhinal cortex of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we confirmed that only centrally active <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, can inhibit the ACE in the brain, augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission and thereby ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the animal model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
