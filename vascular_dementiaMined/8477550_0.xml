<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had been well for ten years following successful cadaveric renal transplantation and was taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two months later she had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> with transient dominant hemisphere disturbances and then suffered a completed right hemisphere deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As this was recovering, she developed an ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, Computerized tomography (CT) was then <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> although CSF analysis showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> and high protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Steroid trial led to dramatic symptomatic and clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On tailing off steroids, progressive bilateral hemisphere disturbance occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She was bedbound, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> and disturbed consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New evidence of infarction in watershed territories on CT led to temporal lobe biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical arterioles and venules showed proliferation of lymphoid cells staining for leucocyte common antigen and B-cell markers characteristic of Neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334660" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Angioendotheliomatosis</z:e> (NAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy she regained independence and mobility and CSF protein fell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first case of NAE to our knowledge in association with immunosuppression for renal transplant and is further evidence that NAE is malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disease is common in such patients, the simultaneous events in differing territories is typical of NAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Response to chemotherapeutic agents occurred although the typical natural history was unchanged </plain></SENT>
