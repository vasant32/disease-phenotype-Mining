<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured quantitatively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular reactivity (VR) was also calculated by comparing the CBF during 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation with the CBF during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular transit time (VTT) that was calculated as a ratio of CBV/CBF and VR reflect vasodilating capacity of the small resistance vessels, whereas OEF designates metabolic (oxygen-extraction) reserve in threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant increase in OEF was seen in the parieto-temporal cortex and both VTT and VR were preserved in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By constrast, there was no significant increase in OEF whereas VTT was prolonged and VR was markedly depressed in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase of OEF and preserved VTT and VR seen in AD patients indicate the possible participation of vascular factors in the pathogenesis of AD perhaps at the capillary level </plain></SENT>
