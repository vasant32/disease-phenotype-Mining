<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Frailty is a clinical syndrome generally associated with a greater risk for adverse outcomes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, disability, institutionalization, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cognition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have already been considered as components of frailty, but the role of frailty as a possible determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has been poorly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated the predictive role of frailty syndrome on incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in a nondemented, Italian, older population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 2581 individuals recruited from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging sample population consisting of 5632 subjects aged 65 to 84 years and with a 3.9-year median follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A phenotype of frailty according to a modified measurement of Cardiovascular Health Study criteria was operationalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD were classified using current published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 3.5-year follow-up, 65 of 2581 (2.5%) older subjects, 16 among 252 frail individuals (6.3%), of which 9 were affected by VaD (3.6%), developed overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a proportional hazards model, frailty syndrome was associated with a significantly increased risk of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-3.40) and, in particular, VaD (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-7.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of AD or other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not significantly change in frail individuals in comparison with subjects without frailty syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our large population-based sample, frailty syndrome was a short-term predictor of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and VaD </plain></SENT>
