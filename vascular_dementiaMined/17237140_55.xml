<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of quantitative gait parameters to decline in specific cognitive domains as well as the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study nested within a community based ageing study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 427 subjects aged 70 years and older with quantitative gait assessments, 399 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up (median 2 years), 33 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis was used to reduce eight baseline quantitative gait parameters to three independent factors representing pace, rhythm and variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In linear models, a 1 point increase on the rhythm factor was associated with further memory decline (by 107%), whereas the pace factor was associated with decline on executive function measured by the digit symbol substitution (by 29%) and letter fluency (by 92%) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox models adjusted for age, sex and education, a 1 point increase on baseline rhythm (hazard ratio (HR) 1.48; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.14) and variability factor scores (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.78) was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pace factor predicted the risk of developing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that quantitative gait measures predict future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in initially non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> older adults </plain></SENT>
