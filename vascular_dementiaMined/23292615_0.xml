<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the dynamic processes of cerebral flow autoregulation (CFA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> vasomotor reactivity have attracted broad attention because of their involvement in a host of pathologies and clinical conditions (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, traumatic brain injury, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This raises the prospect of useful diagnostic methods being developed on the basis of quantitative models of cerebral hemodynamics, if cerebral vascular dysfunction can be quantified reliably from data collected within practical clinical constraints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a modeling method that utilizes beat-to-beat measurements of mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity and end-tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> (collected non-invasively under resting conditions) to quantify the dynamics of CFA and cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unique and novel aspect of this dynamic model is that it is nonlinear and operates in a closed-loop configuration </plain></SENT>
