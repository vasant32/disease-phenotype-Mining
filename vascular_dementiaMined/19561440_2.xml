<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data about the relative frequency of underlying diseases in cases of RPD are few and extremely variable, depending on the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relative frequency of the underlying causes of RPD, in a university tertiary referral center, in Athens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of consecutive patients presenting with RPD in a 3-year period was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a comprehensive clinical, imaging, and laboratory evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 279 patients hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis, 68 patients had RPD (37 males and 31 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> +/-SD was 65.5+/-10.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of RPD was secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, accounting for 18 cases (26.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> were almost equally represented, accounting for 12 (17.6%) and 11 (16.2%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a tertiary referral center, secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> represented the most frequent cause of cases presenting with RPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a substantial number of these cases are potentially treatable, our finding reconfirms and underscores the importance of an exhaustive evaluation in any case presenting with RPD </plain></SENT>
