<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Meta-analysis of inception cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one robust cohort studies were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> clinical studies, population studies and clinical trials were analysed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Mayo defined MCI at baseline and adjusting for sample size, the cumulative proportion who progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was 39.2%, 33.6% and 6.2%, respectively in specialist settings and 21.9%, 28.9% and 5.2%, respectively in population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted annual conversion rate (ACR) from Mayo defined MCI to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and VaD was 9.6%, 8.1% and 1.9%, respectively in specialist clinical settings and 4.9%, 6.8% and 1.6% in community studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Figures from non-Mayo defined MCI and clinical trials are also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ACR is approximately 5-10% and most people with MCI will not progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> even after 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
