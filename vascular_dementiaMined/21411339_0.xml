<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following our Prevalence Study 1998 in Tajiri, Japan, Incidence Study 2003 disclosed that 17.9% of subjects developed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some cases developed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (type I), whereas others already met the criteria for subcortical VaD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) despite very mild stage (Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating [CDR] 0.5) and progressed to mild stage (CDR 1) (type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that prognosis of vascular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) included type II VaD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to causes associated with vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence Study 1998 included 497 randomly selected participants, including 346 with a CDR of 0, 119 with a CDR of 0.5, and 32 with a CDR of 1+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first 2 groups were targeted for Incidence Study 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the database, we reanalyzed the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in the subjects with CDR 0.5 and VaD, prognosis with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and 2 types of VaD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> were achieved by 67% of those with VaD and by 7% of those with vascular MCI (ie, CDR 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CDR 0 group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> had no affect on prognosis; however, in the CDR 0.5 group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> had an affect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of subjects in the CDR 0 and CDR 0.5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (-) groups were classified as type I, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in the CDR 0.5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (+) group were type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although vascular MCI is treatable, it may progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Individuals with this "buried under the community" phenomenon of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> should be targeted for secondary prevention interventions </plain></SENT>
