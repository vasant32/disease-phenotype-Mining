<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Comparisons were made of nicotinic receptors in 3 major forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is well established the involvement of nicotinic receptors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), their status in the other two main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in old age-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is not widely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Temporal cortex was examined for epibatidine and alpha-bungarotoxin binding, and immunoreactivity of alpha4 and alpha7 nAChR subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were selective abnormalities in nicotinic receptor subtypes in the disorders examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AD there is a loss of high affinity receptor binding, reflecting a selective loss of alpha4 subunit, but no change in alpha7 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar abnormalities in ligand binding are also apparent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the VaD series, there was no overall loss of epibatidine binding or immunoreactivity for alpha4 or alpha7 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of cortical receptor alpha4 subunit appears to be a characteristic feature of neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since nicotinic receptors control cerebral vasodilation, the relative integrity of the receptors in VaD may auger well for nicotinic therapy in this disorder in which there is a cholinergic abnormality, to judge by the loss of the presynaptic enzyme </plain></SENT>
