<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (54%), followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients presented with potentially reversible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These frequencies are similar to those reported by case register studies from Western Europe and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences in the frequencies of the dementing diseases according to socioeconomic status or education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> socioeconomic classes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend to a higher frequency of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among patients with less education, but this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
