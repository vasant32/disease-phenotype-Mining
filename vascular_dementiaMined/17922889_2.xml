<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The FBI was administered with other psychometric tests investigating cognitive performances and behavioral scales to the caregivers of 35 patients with the frontal variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (fv-FTD), 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and 15 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were comparable for degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and level of executive impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FBI showed high concurrent validity, internal consistency and good inter-rater and test-retest reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discriminant validity was also very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new FBI cut-off score of 23 gave 97% sensitivity and 95% specificity in distinguishing fv-FTD from non-FTD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the Neuropsychiatic Inventory (NPI) score was unable to differentiate fv-FTD from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FBI is a neurobehavioral tool suitable to distinguish fv-FTD from other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> also when data from cognitive testing or other behavioral scales fail to support the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
