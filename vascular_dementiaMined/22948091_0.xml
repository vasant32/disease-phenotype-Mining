<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> protects against cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker (ARB), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, activates BDNF in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activation in the brain prevents brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi>, a unique ARB with PPAR-gamma stimulating activity, protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> partly because of PPAR-gamma activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> via up-regulation of BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus of hypertensive rats, partly because of PPAR-gamma activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We divided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs), as hypertensive and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model rats, into five groups, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>-treated (TLM), TLM+GW9662, a PPAR-gamma inhibitor, -treated (T+G), GW9662-treated (GW), TLM+ANA-12, a TrkB <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, -treated (T+A), and vehicle-treated SHRSPs (VEH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the treatment for 28 days, systolic blood pressure did not change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, BDNF expression in the hippocampus was significantly higher in TLM than in VEH to a greater extent than in T+G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was significantly higher in TLM than in VEH to a greater extent than in T+G, and was not different between T+A, GW, and VEH </plain></SENT>
