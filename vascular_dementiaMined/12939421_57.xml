<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 616; mean age, 75.0 years) with probable or possible VaD, according to National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche en l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria, were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/day (n = 208), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg/day (after 5 mg/day for the first 28 days) (n = 215), or placebo (n = 193) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the patients enrolled had probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 75.3% of the 10 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group and 80.8% of the 5 mg group completed the study compared with 83.4% of the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>-treated groups showed improvements in cognitive function on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale compared with placebo, with a mean endpoint treatment difference, as measured by the change from baseline score, of approximately 2 points (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg, -1.65 [p = 0.003]; 10 mg, -2.09 [p = 0.0002]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater improvements on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus version were observed with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> groups than with the placebo group (overall <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> treatment vs placebo p = 0.008); 25% of the placebo group showed improvement compared with 39% (p = 0.004) of the 5 mg group and 32% (p = 0.047) of the 10 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were low (placebo, 8.8%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg, 10.1%; 10 mg, 16.3%) </plain></SENT>
