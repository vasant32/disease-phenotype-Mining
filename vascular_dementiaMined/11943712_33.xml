<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed an ultrasensitive bienzyme-substrate-recycle enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assay, which recognizes attomolar amounts of tau, is approximately 400 and approximately 1300 times more sensitive than conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in determining the hyperphosphorylated tau and total tau, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this method, we measured both total tau and tau phosphorylated at Ser-396/Ser-404 in lumbar CSFs from AD and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the total tau was 215 +/- 77 pg/ml in cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (n = 56), 234 +/- 92 pg/ml in non-AD neurological (n = 37), 304 +/- 126 pg/ml in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 46), and 486 +/- 168 pg/ml (n = 52) in AD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a remarkably elevated level in phosphorylated tau was only found in AD (187 +/- 84 pg/ml), as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (54 +/- 33 pg/ml), non-AD (63 +/- 34 pg/ml), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (72 +/- 33 pg/ml) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If we used the ratio of hyperphosphorylated tau to total tau of &gt; or =0.33 as cutoff for AD diagnosis, we could confirm the diagnosis in 96% of the clinically diagnosed patients with a specificity of 95%, 86%, 100%, and 94% against nonneurological, non-AD neurological, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the three control groups combined, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the CSF level of tau phosphorylated at Ser-396/Ser-404 is a promising diagnostic marker of AD </plain></SENT>
