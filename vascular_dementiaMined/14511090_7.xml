<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A two-phase survey, based on a door-to-door survey, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, the Korean version of the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scale (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-K) was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1037 participants aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventy people sampled from the case groups (n = 320) of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-K subscales and the non-case group (n = 50) entered the second phase for clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined using the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1037 elderly people aged 65-94 years who completed the interview, 74 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were detected, giving an overall age-standardized prevalence (95% CI) of 6.8% (6.1-7.5) (male 6.3%[5.3-7.4]; female 7.1%[6.1-8.0]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence (95% CI) of AD was 4.2% (3.6-4.7) (male 2.4%[2.0-2.8]; female 5.3%[4.5-6.1]), and it increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence (95% CI) of VaD was 2.4% (2.0-2.8) (male 3.5%[2.7-4.3]; female 1.6%[1.2-2.1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking for longer than 30 pack-years significantly increased the risk of VaD (OR = 11.5 [2.8-44,6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term smoking, much more prevalent in men, may be closely related to higher risk of cerebrovascular disease that leads to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
