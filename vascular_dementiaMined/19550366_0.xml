<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individual-locus effects and their epistatic effects on susceptibility to VaD were simultaneously assessed by multifactor dimensionality reduction and entropy-based method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 23 loci in 12 genes were studied in 207 VaD patients and age-matched and sex-matched 207 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis revealed that the best single-locus candidate model included angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) Thr235Met with testing accuracy (TA) of 58.31%, the best two-locus candidate model included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> Thr235Met and transforming growth factor-beta1 Pro10Leu with TA of 58.06%, the best three-locus candidate model was not significant (P&gt;0.05), and the best four-locus candidate model included transforming growth factor-beta1 Pro10Leu, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> Thr235Met, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein 2 G34995T, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor T4524G with TA of 57.13% (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best four-locus model was, however, still in question because of the inconsistent best model selection by cross-validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Synergistic epistatic effect of the best two-locus model was proven by entropy-based estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The best predictor for genetic susceptibility to VaD was the single-locus model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best two-locus model reflecting epistasis would be also employed for predicting its susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the epistasis are to elucidate their underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
