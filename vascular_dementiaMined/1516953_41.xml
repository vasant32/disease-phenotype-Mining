<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen otherwise healthy, cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older hypertensive men (mean +/- SD age, 69 +/- 8 years, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> 10-35 years) and 17 age-matched healthy, normotensive male control subjects were studied in a cross-sectional design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axial proton-density image slices were analyzed using region-of-interest and segmentation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypertensive subjects had significantly larger mean volumes of the right and left lateral ventricles (p less than 0.05, both absolute volume and volume normalized to intracranial volume) and a significantly smaller normalized mean left hemisphere brain volume (p less than 0.05) with a trend toward significance for a smaller normalized mean right hemisphere volume (p less than 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hypertensive subjects and one healthy control subject were found to have severe periventricular hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When data for these subjects were removed from the analyses, the normalized lateral ventricle volumes remained significantly larger in the hypertensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lateral ventricle enlargement was not related to age or use of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> in the hypertensive group nor to duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between 10 and 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> results in structural changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies will determine whether MRI-associated changes are progressive and if such changes identify hypertensive subjects at increased risk for clinically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
