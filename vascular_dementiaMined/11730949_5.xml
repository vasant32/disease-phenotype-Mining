<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of receptor subtypes in MCIAT and AD patients revealed a decrease of M3 receptor by more than 50%, an increase of M4 receptor expression by about 20% and no changes of M2 or M5 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of M2-M5 receptors was unaltered in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong positive and negative correlations respectively were found between the density of lymphocyte M3 and M4 receptors and MMSE score in both MCIAT (0.78 for M3 receptor and 0.80 for M4 receptor) and AD (0.82 for M3 receptor and 0.83 for M4 receptor) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that changes in the expression of peripheral blood lymphocyte M3 and M4 receptors in AD are related to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of lymphocyte muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to characterization of cholinergic impairment in AD </plain></SENT>
