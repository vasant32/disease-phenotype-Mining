<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of white matter lesions observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) is not completely clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that white matter lesions are correlated with medullary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> rather than with amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 57 brains were examined, including 39 derived from patients with AD and 13 from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) along with 5 from non-neurological patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate or severe amyloid deposits in the meningocortical segment were observed in 32 out of 39 AD patients (82.1%), and in 2 out of 13 BD patients (15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These deposits were not observed in the white matter segment, except for 2 patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BD patients invariably had marked white matter lesions and fibrohyalinosis in the medullary arteries, with a mean sclerotic ratio of 48.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the AD patients had mild or moderate white matter lesions and a sclerotic ratio of 37.9%, which was significantly greater than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scores for white matter lesions were correlated with the sclerotic ratio of the medullary arteries, but not with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> or the scores for amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> is an independent risk of white matter lesions, its role is limited in the pathogenesis of those associated with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wall thickening of the medullary arteries, likely due to fibrohyalinosis, is closely correlated with the white matter lesions in AD, thus indicating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in its etiology </plain></SENT>
