<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (AA) is suggested in the treatment of BPSD, although controversial data are available on their safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of AA and whether this therapy could modify cognitive and functional domains in parallel with BPSD modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 1,100 patients followed by the psychogeriatric ambulatory of our hospital, 69 patients (6.2%) were in therapy with AA and only 32 of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Namely, the availability was required of a complete geriatric assessment, including the evaluation of cognitive (mini mental state examination=MMSE), emotional (the Italian "scala di valutazione del benessere emotivo nell'anziano"=SVEBA), functional (basic and instrumental activities of daily living=ADL and IADL), as well as behavioral (neuropsychological inventory=NPI) status, at the beginning (T(0)) and after a 6 month therapy (T(1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AA prescribed were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> (42.8%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> (31.3%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi> (25.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 80.1 years; 34.4% male; 65.6% female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Educational level was elementary in 90.6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 21.9% were institutionalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>15.6% had 1 cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF), 50% more than 1, and the remaining with no CVRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than the half of them were diagnosed with degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (D) (40.6% Alzheimer D=AD; 15.6% fronto-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (FTD); 34.4% with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) (9.4%) or combined D (25%); 3,1 % with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), classified as F06.7 by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 (International Classification of Diseases) and 6.2% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common BPSD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, verbal and physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A paired t-test was applied to analyze data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 AA on NPI (mean NPI T(0)=27.50 vs. T(1)=12.13; t=7.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An improvement was also observed on SVEBA (t=1.97), close to significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most people did not have any adverse effects; 5 patients (15.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo> and 1 (3.1%) showed ginecomasty, clinically so relevant to cause the interruption of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The profile of safety and efficacy described on the whole sample was confirmed when it was subdivided according to kind of drug, illness severity and presence/absence of CVRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In a large sample of the "real" subjects attending a geriatric service for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the accurate selection of patients treatable with AA leads to identification of a population with a negligible rate of adverse effects in presence of a high rate of efficacy with respect not only to BPSD but also to cognitive and functional domains </plain></SENT>
