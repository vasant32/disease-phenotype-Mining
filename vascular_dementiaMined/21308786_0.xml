<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between tobacco consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using the same methodology in seven developing countries, testing the specific hypotheses that higher exposure to tobacco is associated with a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, that the association is limited to smoked tobacco and is stronger for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys conducted on individuals aged 65+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 022 residents in specified catchment areas were assessed face-to-face using a standardised protocol, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis and detailed information on past and current tobacco consumption, and on important potential confounders of this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high proportion of participants were never smokers (52% in Dominican Republic to 83% in Peru), most of those who ever used tobacco in China and India were still smoking at age 65 and above (80% and 84%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive association between history of tobacco smoke exposure (pack years up to age 50) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (pooled PR = 1.003; 95%CI 1.001-1.005), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (pooled PR = 1.007; 95% CI, 1.003-1.011) and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (pooled PR = 1.003; 95% CI = 1.001-1.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were attenuated but remained significant if exposure after the age of 50 was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In India there was no association between smokeless tobacco and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> in developing countries appears to be positively associated with history of tobacco smoking but not smokeless tobacco use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selective quitting in later life may bias estimation of associations </plain></SENT>
