<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and nine age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls underwent MRI brain structure scanning that was performed on a SIEMENS AVANTO 1.5 Tesla scanner and standard T1-weighted high-resolution anatomic scans of MPRAGE sequence were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 3-demensional MPRAGE images were processed with FSL-VBM package and the cerebral gray matter density was compared between the subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, the cerebral gray matter density of subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients was found significantly decreasing, including brain regions of thalamus, parietal lobe, frontal lobe and temporal lobe (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cerebral gray matter density alterations have closed correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patient and can be detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI has some potential value in the diagnosis of them </plain></SENT>
