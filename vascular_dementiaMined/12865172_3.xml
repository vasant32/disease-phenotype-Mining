<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>, a natural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi>, is known to scavenge free radicals, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> attenuates white matter damage in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, as a model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion was induced by ligation of the bilateral carotid arteries in male Wistar rats, which received vehicle alone, 100 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>, or 200 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> intraperitoneally at 4-day intervals for 8 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of vacuoles in the optic tract observed after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining was significantly reduced in the 200 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-treated hypoperfusion group versus the vehicle-treated hypoperfusion group (1.7+/-0.2% versus 3.9+/-0.3%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results are consistent with the idea that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> could be protective against at least a part of ischemic white matter damage </plain></SENT>
