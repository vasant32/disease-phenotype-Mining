<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (age 69.0+/-6.54 years) with VD according to NINDS-AIREN criteria underwent quantitative EEG recording, according to the 10-20 system, and fluodeoxyglucose F18 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) at resting condition within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG power FFT-analysis was performed for delta (2-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13.5-20 Hz) frequency bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional EEG power bands were related to regional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in anatomically defined regions corresponding to locations of the 10-20 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Correlation between slow frequency band power and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A widespread inverse relationship of delta power to metabolism was found between various regions; additionally, delta power was negatively correlated to cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in individual regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frontal theta power correlated especially with thalamic CMRglc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alpha power correlated directly with metabolism in the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships were found between beta power and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that EEG power in VD is linked to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, indicating specific regional dependencies </plain></SENT>
