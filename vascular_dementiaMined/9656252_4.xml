<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> patients need assistance or supervision in their daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This often places a major burden on their caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The caregiver burden is reportedly a critical determinant for negative caregiving outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in Japan, no study evaluating the burden experienced by caregivers for patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis with a standardized instrument has been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) is a standardized, validated, reliable tool for assessment of the burden of caregivers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, and has been used in many studies in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we arranged a Japanese version of the ZBI and applied it to caregivers who were caring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After examining the reliability and validity of this version, we then studied a relationship between patients' impairments and caregivers' burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 117 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was made through extensive examinations including MRI and PET/SPECT of the brain and based on appropriate clinical diagnostic criteria of each disorder, which included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (n = 76), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (n = 10), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (n = 11), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients included 80 women and 37 men; the mean age was 72.3 +/- 7.7 (SD) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trained nurses interviewed a principal caregiver of each patient by using the ZBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The caregivers included the patients' spouses (n = 62), offsprings (n = 17), offspring's spouses (n = 37), and sibling (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric impairments and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were assessed with standardized instruments of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADLS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean total ZBI score was 28.6 +/- 15.3 (SD), the Personal strain (PS) score was 17.4 +/- 8.9, and Role strain (RS) score was 6.5 +/- 5.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three scores had high Cronbach's alpha coefficients (Total: 0.88, PS: 0.78, RS: 0.80) and had high Pearson's correlation coefficients with a single global rating of burden (Total: 0.69, PS: 0.65, RS: 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ZBI scores were significantly correlated with MMSE, CDR, HADLS, and NPI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A stepwise regression analysis revealed only the HADLS score and NPI score as significant predictors of ZBI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese version of the ZBI has a sufficient reliability and validity comparable to those reported for the original version </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that the patients' functional and neuropsychiatric impairments were main patient's factors to increase the caregiver's burden </plain></SENT>
