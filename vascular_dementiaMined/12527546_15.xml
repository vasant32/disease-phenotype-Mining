<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine VaD patients completed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale and underwent MRI scanning to generate quantitative ratings of subcortical hyperintensities (SH) and cortical volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' caregivers completed items from the Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, designed to measure instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that performance on the Initiation/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Perseveration</z:e> (IP) subscale, a measure of executive abilities, and SH would significantly predict levels of IADLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A hierarchical multiple-regression analysis revealed that IP and SH accounted for 42% of the variance in IADLs; IP alone accounted for 28%, and SH accounted for 14% beyond the contribution made by IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that specific cognitive and neuropathological factors are associated with functional impairment in VaD </plain></SENT>
