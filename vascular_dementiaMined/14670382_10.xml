<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted in an elderly, ethnically diverse community-dwelling population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated over a range of clinically relevant cut scores for each test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the influence of age, education, reading ability and sex on test performance using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When sensitivity is held constant at 0.69, the specificity for the HVLT total recall was 0.89 and the MMSE 0.82 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (P=.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and education did not significantly influence test performance for either test in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, while adding a measure of reading ability to the regression models did not affect the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model, it resulted in improved specificities when combined with the MMSE for AD and combined with the HVLT for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional tests such as reading ability can improve discrimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The modest sensitivity of either the HVLT or the MMSE alone suggests that further neuropsychological evaluation is required to confirm <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
