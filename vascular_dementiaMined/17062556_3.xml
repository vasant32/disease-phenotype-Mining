<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the content of AGEs was examined with an immunochemical assay in the sera of AD patients, in the frame of a search for a biochemical marker of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were included in the study (n = 30; age range, 68-70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to the healthy control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition test for the determination of AGEs is based on a rabbit anti-AGE, affinity-purified antibody and a model AGE-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> antigen, in which a serum sample treated with proteinase K is used as an inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the measurement of immune complexes and anti-AGE antibodies, the corresponding ELISA tests have been applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AGE level in the VaD group (49.5 U(AGE)) was higher than in AD patients (46.1 U(AGE)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of total AGEs in the sera of AD patients was significantly lower than in the control group (50/51.6 U(AGE)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relations were not observed with regard to the immune complexes and anti-AGE antibody levels in AD (70.2 U(IC)/0.027 U(IgG)) and VaD (83 U(IC)/0.034 U(IgG)) patients because the levels of these parameters were similar to the controls (76.2 U(IC)/0.042 U(IgG)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The work revealed the lower level of circulating serum AGEs in patients with AD in relation to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
