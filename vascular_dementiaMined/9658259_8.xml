<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is in stark contrast to many clinical classificatory systems that weight their definitions strongly towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is complicated by compounding factors that reduce both the validity and specificity of diagnostic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review highlights some of the problems faced in epidemiological, clinical, neuropathological and radiological studies attempting to define a clear-cut syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> is also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the term vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may have outlived its usefulness as a valid concept; alternative approaches are suggested </plain></SENT>
