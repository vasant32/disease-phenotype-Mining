<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We followed 828 nondemented residents of Hisayama Town, Kyushu, Japan, aged 65 years or older (88.3% of the elderly population) for 7 years starting in 1985 in order to determine the type-specific incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its risk factors in the general Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only two subjects were lost to the follow-up, during which period 103 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologic examination of the brains of 89 subjects (86.4%) was made by autopsy or CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We made the initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> based on the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria, with the diagnoses of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) being based on the NINDS-AIREN criteria and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of VD and AD increased with age for both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted total incidence (per 1,000 person-years) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 19.3 for men and 20.9 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding rates for VD were 12.2 for men and 9.0 for women, and for AD, 5.1 for men and 10.9 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the VD subjects whose brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> we examined, the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (42%), but half these subjects lacked a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episode in their histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that age, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes, systolic blood pressure, and alcohol consumption were significant independent risk factors for the occurrence of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, age and a low score on Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale were significant risk factors for AD, and physical activity was a significant preventive factor for AD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
