<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to determine levels of autoantibodies against amyloid and glial-derived structures in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a newly developed Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we measured levels of IgG autoantibodies against neuronal and glial structures in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of a total of 91 subjects (13 PDD, 14 DLB, 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), 11 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (VaD), and 31 healthy controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody levels against α-synuclein, amyloid-β₄₂ (Aβ₄₂), myelin oligodendrocyte <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and S100B were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, autoantibody levels were about three magnitudes higher in serum than in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum autoantibody levels against α-synuclein, Aβ₄₂, MOG, MBP, and S100B were higher in PDD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> compared to tau-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (AD, FTD), VaD, and controls, respectively, with most of them reaching highly significant p-values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), levels of antibodies against oligodendrocyte-derived antigens (MOG, MBP) were significantly increased in PDD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of autoantibodies against both neuronal- and glial-derived antigens in serum and CSF of Lewy body-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> indicate an altered activity of the adaptive immune system in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential of neural-derived IgG autoantibodies as part of a biomarker panel for the diagnosis of Lewy body-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> should be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
