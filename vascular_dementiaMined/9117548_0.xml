<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were classed into three stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> according to the Global deterioration scale (GDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of SLI were significantly decreased in patients suffering from BD, compared to a control group (19.7 +/- 11.6 fmol/ml vs. 30.5 +/- 8.6 fmol/ml, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scores (r = 0.34, P = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed qualitative and quantitative changes in the molecular pattern of SLI suggest that occurrence of a dysregulated posttranslational processing in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas 5-HIAA levels were not significantly changed in patients with BD, HVA was significantly increased in mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (GDS 2-4) and significantly decreased in severe cases (GDS 7) (224.3 +/- 69.9 nmol/ml vs. 364.9 +/- 103.8 nmol/ml, P &lt; 0.01); this correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scores (r = -0.59, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of significant correlations between SLI, 5-HIAA and HVA in BD point to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and generalized neurochemical process affecting several transmitter systems and functions </plain></SENT>
