<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular risk factors increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms for these associations are unclear, and may be due to misdiagnosis of a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome as AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in neuropsychological profile among persons diagnosed clinically with AD with and without vascular risk factors or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Community based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual and composite scores of neuropsychological tests at the time of clinical diagnosis of incident AD were compared among 243 persons with and without vascular risk factors or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among subjects with incident AD, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with lower performance in Delayed Recall of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), while persons diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> scored lower in consistent long term recall (CLTR) of the SRT and current smokers scored lower in Category Fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the risk factors was associated with differences in composite scores in memory, abstract/visuospatial or language domain, nor was the number of risk factors per person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a higher delayed recall score at the time of AD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of vascular risk factors among persons with clinically diagnosed AD was associated with subtle differences in neuropsychological profile at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study needs to be replicated in samples with brain imaging, a comprehensive executive abilities battery, and pathological diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
