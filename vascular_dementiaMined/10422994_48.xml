<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective longitudinal community-based study over a 7-year period (1991-1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1111 nondemented participants (mean [SD] age, 75.0 [5.9] years) were followed up for an average of 2.1 years (range, 1-7.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> according to standardized criteria, by baseline levels of total plasma cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels corrected for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-six (25.7%) of the 1111 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during follow-up; 61 (21.3%) were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 225 (78.7%) as having probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was associated with an approximately 3-fold increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, adjusting for vascular risk factors and demographic variables (relative risk [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> corrected for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) were an even stronger predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the adjusted multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quartile, the RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for the highest quartile of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a)-corrected <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.8-9.6) after adjusting for vascular factors and demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were not associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to determine whether treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0000182'>elevated LDL cholesterol levels</z:mp> will reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
