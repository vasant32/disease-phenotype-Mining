<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An association between anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been reported in several recent studies; however, its physiopathological mechanism remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: A random prospective investigation of 17 male and 13 female patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was made with regard to anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 56 to 77 years (average: 67.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criteria of NINDS-AIREN were used to define the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group of 25 female and 9 male patients was formed with ages ranging from 62 to 80 years (mean: 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the anticardiolipin antibodies was performed by means of Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA) for the quantitative measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipins</z:chebi> in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done using the Fisher's exact test, where p&lt;0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 56.6% of the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 26.4% of the control group (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the prevalence of high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies between the group of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This proves that anticardiolipin antibodies present a risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
