<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) and its individual components with incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and its progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a large longitudinal Italian population-based sample with a 3.5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 2097 participants from a sample of 5632 65-84-year-old subjects from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined according to the Third Adults Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were classified using current published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among MCI patients those with MetS (N=49) had a higher risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.30-14.82) compared with those without MetS (N=72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a multivariate adjustment, the risk in MCI patients with MetS approximately doubled (multivariate adjusted HR, 7.80, 95% CI 1.29-47.20) compared with those MCI without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, among non-cognitively impaired individuals there were no significant differences in risks of developing MCI in those who were affected by MetS (N=608) in comparison with those without MetS (N=837), as well as excluding those individuals with undernutrition or low inflammatory status with or without undernutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our population, among MCI patients the presence of MetS independently predicted an increased risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> over 3.5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
