<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of assessing four cognitive domains obtained from four information sources to identify individuals at risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A representative population sample of nondemented 85-year-olds (n = 313) from Gothenburg, Sweden, was examined regarding memory, language, and visuospatial and executive functions, using self- and key informant reports and neuropsychiatric and psychometric examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample was followed 3 years for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, or possible VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD were preceded by low performance in most domains irrespective of information source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated low memory performance or low cognitive performance with unimpaired memory did not predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive values increased with number of domains affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Self- and key informant reports were less useful for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than neuropsychiatric and psychometric examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best positive predictive value (88%) was for low cognitive performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains using neuropsychiatric and psychometric examinations; however, sensitivity was only 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was necessary to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, it was not sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other cognitive domains needed to be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relying on self-reports or key informants for early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> excluded a large group at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> appeared to have a prodromal stage </plain></SENT>
