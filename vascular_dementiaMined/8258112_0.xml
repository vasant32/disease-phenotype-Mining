<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 48 consecutive patients with periventricular lucencies (PVL) on CT scan of brain to determine the clinical significance of this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (43.7%) patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>; 27 (56.3%) patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but had various other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PVL were frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a PVL scoring system to evaluate the degree of PVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the score was greater than 3.5, the sensitivity and specificity in separating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from other diseases with PVL were 78% and 67% respectively (Kappa = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although mild PVL may be a frequent but non-specific finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, moderate and severe PVL should raise the possibility of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
