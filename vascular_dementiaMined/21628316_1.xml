<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulation and deposition of the NOTCH3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29448">(N3)</z:chebi> extracellular domain in small blood vessels has been recognized as a central pathological feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent experiments suggested enhanced formation of higher order multimers for mutant N3 compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms and consequences of N3 multimerization are still poorly understood, in part because of the lack of an appropriate in vitro aggregation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore developed and validated a robust assay based on recombinant N3 fragments purified from cell culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using single-molecule analysis techniques such as scanning for intensely fluorescent targets and single-particle fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that spontaneous aggregation is limited to CADASIL-mutant N3, recapitulating a central aspect of CADASIL pathology in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N3 aggregation requires no co-factor and is facilitated by sulfhydryl crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although WT N3 does not exhibit multimerization itself, it can participate in aggregates of mutant N3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that thrombospondin-2, a known interaction partner of N3, co-aggregates with mutant N3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequestration of WT N3 and other proteins into aggregates represents a potentially important disease mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings in combination with a new assay for single-molecule aggregation analysis provide novel opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
