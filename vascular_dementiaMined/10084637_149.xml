<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 625 patients (67.8% women; mean age = 82.7 years) with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (73%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (15%), or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (12%) and significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> and behavioral symptoms were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> rating scale (BEHAVE-AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study was completed by 70% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 95% of the patients, indicating severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At endpoint, significantly greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At week 12, 0.5 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> scores (p = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> than 1 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common dose-related adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, and mild peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo> in patients receiving 1 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> was not significantly greater than in placebo patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> significantly improved symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results show that 1 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> is an appropriate dose for most elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
