<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)] serum levels have been associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, and preliminary observations suggest that they are a risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between Lp(a) levels and cognitive performances in the general population has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the effect of elevated Lp(a) levels on cognitive functions in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cognitive performances were assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Babcock Short Story, and the Matrix Test in a population sample of 435 white subjects aged 65 to 84 years who were evaluated at baseline and after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) levels were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in neuropsychological test scores between subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) levels, although subjects with elevated Lp(a) levels had slightly better cognitive performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference reached a statistical significance level only in a subscore of the Matrix Test (number of correct responses) when adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, no statistically significant difference was found in cognitive performances between subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) serum levels in either univariate or multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) showed a similar decline rate during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of elderly white subjects, elevated Lp(a) levels were not associated with poorer cognitive performances or with an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated Lp(a) levels do not appear to be a major determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
