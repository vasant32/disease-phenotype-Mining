<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) is a monogenic variant of small vessel disease resulting from mutations in NOTCH3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers almost invariably develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and eventually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study describes the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive abnormalities</z:hpo> in CADASIL subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 65 mutation carriers (mean age=47.3 years, SD=10.5) and 30 matched comparison subjects (mean age=47.2 years, SD=14.0) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent a series of assessments that included ratings of global cognition, the cognitive portion of the Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale, and specific tests of executive function and attention with measures of processing speed and error monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CADASIL subjects had pronounced impairments of the timed measures (Stroop II and III, Trail Making Test, symbol digit, digit cancellation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measures of error monitoring (Stroop III, Trail Making Test, symbol digit, maze task) were also significantly affected but to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prominent deficits further included verbal fluency and ideational praxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recall, orientation, and receptive language skills were largely preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses indicated a similar profile in subjects with early and advanced impairment of global cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight processing speed as the most substantial area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in CADASIL subjects, with less pronounced yet significant deficits in other aspects of executive performance and attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is present at an early stage and enables the construction of targeted test batteries for clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that the profile of dysfunction described here represents the core of the cognitive syndrome associated with small vessel disease and subcortical ischemic vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
