<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the status of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E allele in 538 participants in the incidence phase of the ongoing Shanghai Survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, including 103 demented subjects, 72 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and 363 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The apo E epsilon 4 allele was present in 10.2% of control subjects and the allelic frequency did not change between ages 60 to 96 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The apo E epsilon 4 allelic frequency was increased both in those wiht <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (25.4%) and those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (22.2%), but not in those with other dementing illnesses or the cognitively impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the subjects homozygous for apo E epsilon 4 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, three were diagnosed as having AD, and three met NINDS/AIREN criteria for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased apo E epsilon 4 allelic frequency in clinically diagnosed VaD patients suggests that some of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085220" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congophilic angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio of developing AD in this community-derived study for persons with at least one apo E epsilon 4 allele was 4.1 (95% CI: 2.2, 7.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the apo E epsilon 4 risk of developing AD in this Chinese cohort is similar to that in western community studies </plain></SENT>
