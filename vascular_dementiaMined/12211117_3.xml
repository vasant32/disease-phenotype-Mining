<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: eighty-eight community-dwelling outpatients were comprehensively evaluated and met <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for DAT or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive evaluation included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAMCOG derived clock drawings were blindly evaluated by the same investigator, according to Freedman's method for clock drawing, and a total score as well as subscores (contour, numbers, hands and center) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between DAT and VD patients in terms of demographic (age, gender, education) and cognitive (MMSE score, CAMCOG score) characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the average, the VD group showed slightly poorer performance on each of the clock drawing test (CDT) measures studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With application of the Bonferroni correction, only Freedman's total score and hands subscore were statistically different between groups (p&lt;0.003, p&lt;0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analyses showed that the only significant variable was Freedman's total score (B=-0.273, p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise discriminant analysis identified Freedman's total score as the only significant predictor of diagnosis (Wilkes' lambda=0.903, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model correctly classified 65.9% overall into the respective DAT and VD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDT scored according to a comprehensive technique may be of value in differentiating DAT from VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the classificatory ability of Freedman's method might be attributed to its presumed sensitivity to impaired executive functioning which is more pronounced in VD compared with DAT patients </plain></SENT>
