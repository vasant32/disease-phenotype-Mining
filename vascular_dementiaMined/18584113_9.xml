<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced PLA2-activity has been reported so far in blood samples and postmortem neuronal tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we studied PLA2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), vascular (VD), and mixed Alzheimer/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular PLA2 was assessed in CSF of 16 AD, 12 VD, 15 MD patients, and 19 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fluorometric assay was applied using the PLA2-specific substrate NBDC6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly reduced PLA2 activity was not only found in AD, but also in VD and MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was independent of demographic co-variates and medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PLA2 results in CSF corroborate previous findings of impaired PLA2 function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and extend these to patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are likely to reflect an involvement of PLA2 impairment in a variety of pathomechanisms crucial in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, in which disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission and disturbance of intact membrane function appear to be the key mechanisms </plain></SENT>
