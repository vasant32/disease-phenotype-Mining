<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initiating event of cholesterol-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is the retention and accumulation of atherogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apoB) together with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> in the vascular intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biglycan, a member of the small leucine-rich protein family, was suspected of contributing to this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The individual and combined overexpressions of biglycan and apoB-100 were therefore examined on the cortical APP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of transgenic mice by means of semiquantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared with the control littermates, transgenic biglycan mice had significantly increased cortical APP695 (122%) and APP770 (157%) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, while the double transgenic (apoB(+/-)xbiglycan(+/-)) mice did not exhibit any changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first experimental evidence that the atherogenic risk factor biglycan alters APP splicing and may participate in the pathogenesis of both Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
