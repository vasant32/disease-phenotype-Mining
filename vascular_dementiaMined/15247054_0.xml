<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, Antagonic-Stress (AS)--an advanced integrative therapy, with specific synergistic composition, and patented internationally--represents a significant strategy in health, aging, and longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical research with AS proves the drug's efficacy in the management of distress (neurotic, stress-related, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">affective disorders</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349251" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors</z:e>; mental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disorders</z:hpo> due to psychoactive substance uses) and psychogeriatrics [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0556007" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders</z:e> (OMD)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific multiaxial psychopathological instruments and psychometric tests in multiple assessments used for gerontopsychiatry demonstrated strong improvements after AS administration in early-moderate stages of Alzheimer or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as in other OMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, comparative clinical studies evinced the superiority of AS (synergistic multitherapy) versus monotherapy [meclofenoxate (MF), piracetam (PA), pyritinol (PT), and nicergoline (NE), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These comparative clinical trials agreed closely with comparative preclinical research and confirmed AS synergistic homeostatic, adaptogenic, antioxidative, cerebrovascular, neurometabolic, and nootropic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the AS protective actions against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> recommend this orthomolecular therapy in stress, aging, and free radical pathology </plain></SENT>
