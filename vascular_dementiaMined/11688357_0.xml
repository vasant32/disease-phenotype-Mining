<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multidimensional assessment permits global evaluation of the needs and problems of the elderly patient and consequently guarantees an adequate and complete therapeutic plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach is particularly valid if applied in a Medical Division because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illnesses can compromise a functional state that is already in precarious equilibrium due to frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679225" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multiple pathologies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, thanks to an accurate evaluation of this type, it is possible to recognize patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we utilized a geriatric multidimensional assessment in our Department of Internal Medicine to search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was found in 20% of the geriatric patients: 29% were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 44% had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the physical health, functional ability, psychological and socio-economical status together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349251" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioral syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
