<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in tTG protein level is found in postmortem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) brains as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No study revealed tTG in vivo so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the concentrations of tTG in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from 84 patients using ELISA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared 33 patients with probable AD to 18 patients with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and 33 control patients without neuropsychological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was supported by CSF parameter and neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a highly significant difference (P = 0.001) between the concentration of tTG in the AD groups (7.58 pg/ml) and controls (2.99 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between controls and VaD (2.93 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, tTG did not show an association with tau protein, Abeta42, apoE4, neuropsychological items, or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males showed lower tTG values than females; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that tTG is increased in AD in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that tTG may be a powerful biochemical marker of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> degenerating process in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may serve as completion of CSF analysis in the diagnosis of dementing disorders and may be a simple way of assessing the efficacy of possible new antiapoptotic drugs </plain></SENT>
