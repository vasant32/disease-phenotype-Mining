<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The form called <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND)represents a subclinical phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different studies have shown a possible effect of micro- and macro-nutrients on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trace elements, being involved in metabolic processes and redox reactions in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), could influence the cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the presence of an eventual correlation between serum trace element concentrations and cognitive function in a group of subjects with CIND and manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> = AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> = VaD), and compared them with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty -five patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a clinical and biochemical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also performed a neuropsychological and functional assessment (the Milan overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> assessment = MODA, activities of daily living = ADL, and instrumental activities of daily living = IADL), and a computerized tomographic (CT) cerebral scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were than divided in 4 groups according to the obtained diagnosis (Controls, CIND, AD, VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions, affecting cognitive functions, was considered as exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A blood sample was collected to determine iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> (Mn), <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (Se), <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> (Co), <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> (Cr), copper (Cu),<z:chebi fb="11" ids="28685">molybdenum</z:chebi> (Mo) and aluminium (Al) serum concentrations (chromatographic,spectrophotometric methods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our cohort we found a positive correlation between cognitive function, expressed as the MODA score, and Se, Cr, Co and Fe serum levels,while a negative correlation was observed between MODA score, Cu and Al serum levels.Moreover, some statistically significant differences in Se, Cr, Co, Cu and Al concentrations were found among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to these results, we may suppose that Se, Cr and Co protect cognitive function, Cu influences the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, while Al contributes to the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
