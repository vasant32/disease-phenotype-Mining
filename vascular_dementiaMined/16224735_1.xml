<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) is the second most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in western societies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It includes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders in which vascular factors are believed to play a vital role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aims and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine what instruments can be used to diagnose VD and to what extent such a diagnosis is reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this end, we review the diagnostic criteria that have been used up to now, the role played by neuropsychology, the value of neurosonology studies, and the growing development of neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current diagnostic criteria for VD select a group that is clinically and aetiologically very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such criteria need shifting towards new evidence-based criteria derived from analyses of population studies that focus on the early stages of the disease and that make a proper distinction between patients with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subcortical subtype of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SVCI) is a form of vascular impairment that is more homogeneous and which selects more representative patients with a more predictable clinical pattern, natural history, response to treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These characteristics make SVCI cases an ideal group for comparisons between clinical trials and studies </plain></SENT>
