<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cerebrovascular cell activation can reveal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders in the absence of visible lesions and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we optimized contrast carrying particles targeting vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and MRI protocols through both in vitro and in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, pre-contrast MRI images failed to reveal the ongoing pathology, contrast-enhanced MRI revealed hypoperfusion-triggered <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> injury in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, unmasked amyloid-induced cerebrovascular activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and allowed monitoring of disease activity during experimental autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, contrast-enhanced MRI revealed the cerebrovascular cell activation associated with known risk factors of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders such as peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By providing a dramatically higher sensitivity than previously reported methods and molecular contrast agents, the technology described in the present study opens new avenues of investigation in the field of neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
