<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the efficacy of the occupational therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we included in the occupational therapy (OT) program 34 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> admitted at our RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of them had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), twenty had Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a period of 40 days they followed a daily therapeutic program of OT for washing, personal hygiene (combing their hair, shaving), dressing, sanitary services and eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were tested with the Ronchi brief evaluation battery (RBEB) before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the treatment we observed a significant improvement in both groups in their mean scores obtained with the RBEB in many of their functional areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These improvements in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were more consistent compared to those patients with AD, but in spite of these differences we saw that, independently from the etiology, it is possible to recuperate residual functional capacities utilizing OT programs in order to guarantee the highest level of autonomy possible for each patient </plain></SENT>
