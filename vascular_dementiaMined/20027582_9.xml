<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To monitor changes in the number of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in a longitudinal study of healthy controls (HC) and mild-cognitively impaired (MCI) patients using susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: SWI was used to image 28 HC and 75 MCI patients annually at 1.5 Tesla over a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnitude and phase data were used to visualize CMBs for the first and last scans of 103 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preliminary analysis revealed that none of the 28 HC had more than three CMBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 75 MCI patients, five subjects had more than three CMBs in both first and last scans, while one subject had more than three bleeds only in the last scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five of these six MCI patients, the number of CMBs increased over time and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six went on to develop progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 130 total CMBs seen in the last scans of the six MCI cases, most were less than 4 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SWI can reveal small CMBs on the order of 1 mm in diameter and this technique can be used to follow their development longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring CMBs may be a means by which to evaluate patients for the presence of microvascular disease that leads to PCI </plain></SENT>
