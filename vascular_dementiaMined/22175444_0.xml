<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine job control, job demands, social support at work, and job strain (ratio of demands to control) in relation to risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The population-based Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> in Swedish Twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-seven people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (167 AD, 46 VaD) and 9,849 without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses were based on telephone screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> followed by in-person clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An established job exposure matrix was matched to main occupation categories to measure work characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In generalized estimating equations (adjusted for the inclusion of complete twin pairs), lower job control was associated with greater risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.31) and VaD specifically (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.07-1.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower social support at work was associated with greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.03-1.28), AD (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00-1.31), and VaD (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.02-1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Greater job strain was associated with greater risk of VaD only (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.02-1.60), especially in combination with low social support (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11-1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and education were controlled for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Work complexity, manual work, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> did not explain the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences in work-related stress scores were observed in the 54 twin pairs discordant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, although only two pairs included a twin with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Work-related stress, including low job control and low social support at work, may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Modification to work environment, including attention to social context and provision of meaningful roles for employees, may contribute to efforts to promote cognitive health </plain></SENT>
