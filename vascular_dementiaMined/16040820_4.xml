<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In brain perfusion studies, perfusion defects have been reported mainly in the temporal and parietal regions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), but it is known that the occipital cortex is partially preserved from metabolic defects in patients with AD, at least in the early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the reactivity of the posterior cerebral arteries during visual stimulation with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with AD (mean age, 70 years), 12 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) (mean age, 61.5 years), and 9 healthy control subjects (mean age, 58 years) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of both posterior cerebral arteries during visual stimulation was measured with TDU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactivity was calculated by the differences in mean relative blood flow velocity (rBFv) between stimulation (vs) and rest (vr) divided by the resting value [rBFv = 100 x (vs - vr)/vr] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant increases of vascular reactivity were obtained during visual stimulation for each group (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant right or left side difference for vascular reactivity within the groups except in VD; therefore, values of the right and left sides were pooled for patients with AD and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactivity to visual stimulation was similar for the patients with AD (mean +/- SD, 38% +/- 2.2%) and control subjects (35% +/- 1.8%), but reactivity was found significantly decreased in both sides of patients with VD (25.7% +/- 2.1% for the left side and 24% +/- 2.6% for the right side) compared with the healthy control subjects and the patients with AD (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the occipital cortex is partially preserved in patients with AD and that functional TDU may be a valuable tool for differentiating VD and AD </plain></SENT>
