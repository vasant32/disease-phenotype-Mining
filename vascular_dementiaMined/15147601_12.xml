<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relationships between seven measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> derived brain volume or indices of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and neuropsychological performance in the elderly subjects of the population-based Cache County, Utah Study of Aging and Memory (n = 195) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measures included uncorrected total brain volume (TBV), TBV corrected by total intracranial volume (TICV), TBV corrected by the ratio of the individuals TICV by group TICV (TBVC), a ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR), total ventricular volume (TVV), TVV corrected by TICV, and a measure of parenchymal volume loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases from the Cache County Study were comprised of elderly individuals classified into one of four subject groups based on a consensus diagnostic process, independent of quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups included subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD, n = 85), no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but mild/ambiguous (M/A) deficits (n = 30), a group of subjects with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or neuropsychiatric disorder including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 60), and control subjects (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological performance was based on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and an expanded neuropsychological test battery (consortium to establish a registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (CERAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the various quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measures were highly interrelated and no single measure was statistically superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, TBVC, TBV/TICV and VBR consistently exhibited the more robust relationships with neuropsychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a single corrected brain volume measure or index is sufficient in studies examining global <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in relation to cognitive function and recommends use of either TBVC, TBV/TICV, or VBR </plain></SENT>
