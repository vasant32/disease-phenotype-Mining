<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On magnetic resonance imaging the disease is manifested as white matter lesions, lacunes and microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is complex, with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The heritability of white matter lesions is constantly high over different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies identified several loci for these lesions however no genes responsible for the linkage signals had been identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from genetic association studies using the candidate gene approach support the role of APOE, the renin-angiotensin system, as well as the Notch3 signaling pathway in the development of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recent genomegenome wide association study on white matter lesions identified a novel locus on chromosome 17q25 harboring several genes such as TRIM65 and TRIM47 which pinpoints to possible novel mechanisms leading to these lesions </plain></SENT>
