<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data of persons living in two homes (elderly people and psychiatric patients) were overviewed together with the patients admitted to our hospital in 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was discovered that there were 40 Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in our catchment area of 107,000 population which may be increased by private and undiscovered cases to approximately 50 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) proved to be higher (2-3 x) than the AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings need also explanation considering the different proportions in the incidence rate of Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> existing between Hungary and other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the lower life expectancy, a tendency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and some environmental factors may be responsible for the higher number of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However these findings and statements should not decrease our effort in the research work which has to include the study of the etiology, pathogenesis and the possibility of a successful treatment of AD in the future </plain></SENT>
