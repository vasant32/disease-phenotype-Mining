<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologists conducted semistructured interviews and examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants; they also interviewed family members in cases where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by consensus according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 3rd ed, revised (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 2,055 contacted individuals, 1,736 (84.5%) participated in the study and 44 ( 13 men and 31 women) were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including 35 (80%) with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and 3 (7%) with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VsD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0.5% for ages 65-74 years, 2.9% for ages 75-84 years, and 12.0% for ages 85-101 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall rate was 2.5% for age &gt; or =65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, neither a lack of formal education nor being a woman was a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2-year follow-up, 30 of the 44 demented participants had died, yielding a 2-year survival rate of 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results corroborated our previous findings of lower prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the Chinese than among Western populations, and both genetic and sociocultural factors may have contributed to the low rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of neuroradiological imaging studies in the present study may have contributed to the finding of an unusually low rate of VsD </plain></SENT>
