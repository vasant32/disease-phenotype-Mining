<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that physical activity may be related to the clinical expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the association includes low-intensity activity such as walking is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between walking and future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Distance walked per day was assessed from 1991 to 1993 in 2257 physically capable men aged 71 to 93 years in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was based on neurological assessment at 2 repeat examinations (1994-1996 and 1997-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the course of follow-up, 158 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified (15.6/1000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, men who walked the least (&lt;0.25 mile/d) experienced a 1.8-fold excess risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with those who walked more than 2 mile/d (17.8 vs 10.3/1000 person-years; relative hazard [RH], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-3.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with men who walked the most (&gt;2 mile/d), an excess risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was also observed in those who walked 0.25 to 1 mile/d (17.6 vs 10.3/1000 person-years; RH, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02-2.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted after accounting for other factors, including the possibility that limited amounts of walking could be the result of a decline in physical function due to preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that walking is associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Promoting active lifestyles in physically capable men could help late-life cognitive function </plain></SENT>
