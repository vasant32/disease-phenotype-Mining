<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were suspected to have CSF flow disturbance from clinical symptoms and simple brain CT scan findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their average age, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and score of Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale (HDS) were 76.2 years, 5.9 years, 9.5/32.5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before performing CT-cisternography, clinical diagnosis for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 18 patients, Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 12, suspect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> in 5, and other diagnoses in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the results of cisternography, we found 13 patients with CSF flow disturbance (contrast material remained in the ventricle more than 48 hours after injection), and 17 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former showed lower scores of HDS, higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> scores and smaller areas of the interhemispheric fissure on CT scan than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But the former showed no significant difference from the latter in the average age, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and width of the ventricles </plain></SENT>
