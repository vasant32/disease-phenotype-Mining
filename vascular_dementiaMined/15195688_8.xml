<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which induces cerebrovascular changes, can cause also brain damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess astroglial reaction in different brain areas (frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and striatum) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in the pre-hypertensive phase (2 months of age), in the developing phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (4 months of age) and in established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (6 months of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SHR were compared to age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis included reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, GFAP immunochemistry (Western blot analysis) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and an increase of GFAP immunoreactivity were noticeable in different brain areas of SHR compared to normotensive WKY rats at 6, but not at 2 or 4 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed a numerical augmentation (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>) and an increase in size (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and striatum of SHR </plain></SENT>
