<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> values were found in approximately 10% of these patients, due to latent pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in one case, post-gastrectomy in seven cases and small intestinal resection in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 72 cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0100502'>vitamin B12 deficiency</z:hpo> was probably caused by nutritional insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After correction of the dietary defect there was a spontaneous increase in serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> in 75% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No specific psychiatric syndrome was connected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypovitaminosis</z:e> <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>, but a preponderance of arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> suggests that low serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> values are secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental illness</z:e> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and loss of appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most cases will recover without further <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But some patients may need treatment because of severe mental and physical disabilities </plain></SENT>
