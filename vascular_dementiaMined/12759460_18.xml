<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In our earlier results, we demonstrated that cells expressing the complement C5aR are vulnerable since abnormal activation of C5aR caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that activation of C5aR by antisense homology box (AHB) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> synthesized in multiple antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> form and representing putative interaction sites of the C5a/C5aR evoked calcium influx in TGW <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent inhibition of the response was found when the cells were pretreated with C5a, suggesting that C5aR was involved in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, pretreatment with monomeric forms of the AHB <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> resulted in attenuation of the calcium signals, supporting the idea of the role of C5aR in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells of a neuron-rich primary culture and pyramidal cells of rat brain slices also responded to the AHB <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> activation with an increase in the intracellular calcium level, showing that calcium metabolism might be affected in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining demonstrated that C5aR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could be induced both in cells of the primary culture as well as in cortical pyramidal neurons of the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated expression of C5aR in the hippocampal and cortical neurons of human brains of healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients using two anti-human C5aR Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cortex and granular cells of the hippocampus were immunopositive on staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although staining was also positive in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> brain, it disappeared in the brain with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide further support that C5aR may be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
