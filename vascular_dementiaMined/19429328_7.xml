<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF STUDY: In the present study, we examined whether UR suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>Atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> (AD)-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in NC/Nga mice treated with 2, 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">dinitrofluorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi>) under SPF conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effect of UR in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi>- treated NC/Nga mice was determined by measuring the skin symptom severity, levels of serum IgE, and of the amounts of IL-4 and IFN-gamma secreted by activated T cells in draining lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oral administration of UR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi>-treated NC/Nga mice was found to inhibit ear thickness increases and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells from the lymph nodes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi>-treated NC/Nga mice was significantly inhibited by UR treatment, although levels of IL-4 and total IgE in serum were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: UR may suppress the development of AD-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53049">DNFB</z:chebi>-treated NC/Nga mice by reducing IFN-gamma production </plain></SENT>
