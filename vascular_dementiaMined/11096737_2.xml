<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the same measures in the prevention of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remains unclear, however, owing mainly to the lack of agreement on the definition and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
