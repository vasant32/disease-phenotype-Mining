<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations, brain imaging, and electroencephalography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were diagnosed with subjective memory complaints (SMC), 32 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), 43 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT), and 14 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of the SMC group, 31% of the MCI group, 45% of the DAT group, and 62% of the VAD group had increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (s-HCY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis of 19 variables showed 3 significant principal components by cross-validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the patients (MMSE) was explained to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the principal component analysis, the population followed two different routes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>: one correlated with disturbance of one-carbon metabolism (cerebrospinal fluid <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and s-HCY) and the other correlated with more classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as marked by cerebrospinal fluid tau, vascular risk factors, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on brain imaging, possession of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 allele, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was poor discrimination between DAT and VAD </plain></SENT>
