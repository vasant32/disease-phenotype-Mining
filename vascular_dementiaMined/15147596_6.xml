<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are present among persons who will be diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) 3 years later, and (2) the pattern of such deficits is similar to that observed in preclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VaD diagnosis was a diagnosis of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population-based samples of 15 incident VaD cases, 43 incident AD cases, and 149 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were compared on tests of episodic and short-term memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups showed preclinical impairment relative controls on tasks assessing episodic memory 3 years before diagnosis, and there were no differences between these groups on any cognitive measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The existence of a preclinical phase in the present VaD cases suggests that circulatory disturbance may affect cognitive performance before the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that leads to clinical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results extend previous findings of similar patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in the early clinical phases of AD and VaD to the preclinical phases of these diseases </plain></SENT>
