<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale (HDS), the severity of 46 VD patients were classified into three grades as gentle, medium and severe, in the same time, they were divided into the EA group (n = 23) and the nimotop group (n = 23) randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes of EEG in the patients were observed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of normality of EEG in VD patients were positively correlated with the severity of their illness, i. e. the severer VD, the more obvious the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EEG can be accessible for evaluating the severity of VD, and the electrical activity of brain in VD patients could be improved by EA therapy </plain></SENT>
