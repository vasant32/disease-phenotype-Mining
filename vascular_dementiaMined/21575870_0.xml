<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The six domain standard Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (CDRstd) has been successful for staging patients with the clinical syndrome of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CDRstd does not specifically address language dysfunction or alteration in personality and social behaviors which are prominent in behavioral variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (bvFTD) and primary progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (PPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of adding domains of Language (LANG), and Behavior, Comportment, and Personality (BEHAV) to the CDRstd for the evaluation of patients with bvFTD and PPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two new domains, LANG and BEHAV, were constructed to parallel the six domains sampled in the CDRstd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and neuropsychological test data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dataset contained information on 2550 probable AD, 88 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 281 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with Lewy body, 234 bvFTD, and 137 PPA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 76.5% of bvFTD and 99.3% of PPA patients with abnormal ratings (&gt;0) on the LANG domain; 90.2% of bvFTD and 63.5% of PPA had abnormal ratings on the BEHAV domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with a CDRstd sum of boxes score of &lt;4, 53.7% of bvFTD had BEHAV domain and 78.6% of PPA patients had LANG domain scores&gt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among probable AD patients, 3.7% had LANG ratings that were ≥1 and 3.8% had BEHAV ratings that were ≥1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that adding either the LANG or BEHAV domains to the CDRstd sum of boxes score significantly improved the discrimination between probable AD, bvFTD, and PPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new LANG and BEHAV domains add value to the CDRstd for the characterization of the nonamnestic symptoms that are prominent in patients with bvFTD and PPA but that also occur in those with probable AD </plain></SENT>
