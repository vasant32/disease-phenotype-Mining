<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: 140 subjects with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to take 1 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28115">methylcobalamin</z:chebi> and 5 mg of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, or placebo once daily for 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale (MDRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were MDRS domain scores, neuropsychiatric inventory and Cornell scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed at baseline and every six months during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma tHCY concentrations were measured at baseline and month 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Trial groups were well matched in baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average plasma tHCY concentration of subjects was 14.1 ± 3.8 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>80% of subjects completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The supplement group had average plasma tHCY reduced to 9.3 ± 2.7 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant group difference in changes in any of the neuropsychological scores, but among those with elevated plasma tHCY (&gt;13 μmol/L), the decline in MDRS (construction domain) was significantly smaller in the supplement group (median 0 versus 2 points in placebo group, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> lowering in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients did not significantly reduce global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
