<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This prospective study focused on the accuracy of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and 20 controls who underwent a systematic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of probable AD or possible AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria was assigned in 69% of the patients, 21% had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) and 8% had mixed AD-VaD; only 2 patients (2%) had the Lewy body variant of AD (AD-LB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a 3-year period 57 patients died, 53 of them (93%) being autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination according to the CERAD criteria showed definite AD in 27 out of 28 (96%) patients diagnosed as probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the possible AD group, the diagnostic accuracy was also high, 86% showed at least some degree of AD pathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neocortical senile plaque scores correlated significantly with tangle scores in patients with AD pathology, and there was a significant negative correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and neocortical tangle scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance between the clinical diagnosis and pathological findings was clearly lower in VaD than in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the clinical VaD group, 8 of 10 patients had at least some degree of AD changes together with vascular changes and only 2 of 10 patients had pure VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the high accuracy of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for diagnosing AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, uncertainty in the clinical diagnosis of VaD should be taken into account, for example, in drug trials with VaD patients </plain></SENT>
