<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) reduce risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the association between use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, aspirin, and the non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> acetaminophen with incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study included 3,229 individuals aged 65 or older, free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline, with information on medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association of medication use with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses considered the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>-AD relationship as a function of age, presence of at least one epsilon 4 allele at APOE, race, and individual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>' reported ability to reduce production of the amyloid-beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> variant A beta(42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (adjusted hazard ratio or aHR 0.76, 95% CI or CI 0.60-0.96) and, in particular, AD (aHR 0.63, CI 0.45-0.88), but not VaD (aHR 0.92, CI 0.65-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No similar trends were observed with acetaminophen (aHR 0.99, CI 0.79-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Closer examination suggested AD risk reduction with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> only in participants having an APOE epsilon 4 allele (aHR 0.34, CI 0.18-0.65; aHR for others 0.88, CI 0.59-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no advantage in AD risk reduction with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> reported to selectively reduce A beta(42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with previous cohort studies showing reduced risk of AD in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users, but this association was found only in those with an APOE epsilon 4 allele, and there was no advantage for A beta(42)-lowering <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
