<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 1,057 surviving men of the Caerphilly cohort with audiometric data at baseline were followed for 17 years for cognitive outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pure-tone unaided audiometric threshold was assessed at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 KHz at baseline and after 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, including standard criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was assessed by repeat administration of a cognitive test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age-adjusted auditory threshold across both time points was associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for premorbid cognitive function, the association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was retained (odds ratio(0.5 KHz) = 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-5.18; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stronger associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> were found for tests administered by interview than for those administered by computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has found an association of auditory threshold with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> over a 17-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this association are unclear and may include a prodromal effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on auditory threshold, an effect of auditory threshold on cognitive assessment, an effect of auditory threshold on cognitive loss, or a shared etiologic pathway between both </plain></SENT>
