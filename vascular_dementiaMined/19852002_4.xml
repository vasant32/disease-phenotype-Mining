<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral white-matter changes (WMCs) are frequently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and have been proposed to be related to vascular factors and a certain symptomatological profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have included both vascular factors and a broad spectrum of cognitive, neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e>, easily detectable by the physician in the everyday clinical work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to study the relationships between WMCs on MRI/CT and neuropsychiatric symptoms and vascular factors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standardized examination including medical history, clinical examinations, laboratory tests and brain imaging (CT or MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The identification and severity degree of WMCs was assessed blindly to clinical findings, using a semi-quantitative scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For statistical analyses, patients were grouped based on absence or presence of WMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant variables in bivariate analyses were included as predictors in stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed significant associations between WMCs and age, gender, blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were significant associations between WMCs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, mental slowness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> and focal neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multivariate logistic model revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, mental slowness and age as the most consistent predicting factors for WMCs, together with MRI as a radiological method for the detection of WMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that WMCs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are associated with a dysexecutive-related behavioural symptom profile, vascular factors related to small and large vessel diseases and age </plain></SENT>
