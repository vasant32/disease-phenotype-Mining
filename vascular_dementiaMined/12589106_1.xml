<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 52-yr-old Korean woman with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) whose diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy and the presence of a novel mutation in the NOTCH3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical features were rather unusual in that 1) clinical presentations were only two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> unaccompanied by mood disturbances or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and 2) there was no family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities in both temporal pole areas in line with the recent suggestion by O'Sullivan et al. that the abnormality could be a radiologic marker of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET also showed a hypometabolism in the temporal pole areas with an abnormal finding on MRI in addition to the hypometabolism in cortical and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could learn from this case that CADASIL may be included in the differential diagnoses in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with a small vessel disease, even in the absence of a family history, especially when there are no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and when the MRI shows T2 hyperintensity in the temporal pole regions </plain></SENT>
