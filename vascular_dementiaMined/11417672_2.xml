<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the performance of individuals with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) on the Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT) and to determine the influence of naming on HVOT performance in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The HVOT is commonly administered to assess visuospatial perception among neurologic patients, but the test requires verbal identification of stimuli as well as spatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have examined the influence of naming on the HVOT, but the issue has not been systematically addressed in individuals with subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Individuals with a diagnosis of VaD were administered the HVOT, three additional measures of visuospatial function (Block Design and Picture Completion subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test copy trial), and the Boston Naming Test (BNT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, the VaD patients performed poorly compared with normative data on each of the cognitive measures, with the most pronounced deficit evident on the BNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses revealed that more than 60% of the variance in performance on the HVOT was accounted for by performance on the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised; performance on the BNT did not contribute significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that VaD patients perform below expectations on the HVOT and that the measure is robust to naming deficits in this population </plain></SENT>
