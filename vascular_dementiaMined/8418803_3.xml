<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical data, collected from an unselected group of subjects, to a small set of factors and to see how these factors correspond to standard clinical diagnosis of dementing disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: General community: elderly older than 74 years, from an area in Stockholm, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Population-based sample including (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the screened positive subjects using the Mini-Mental State examination; and (2) a random sample of the screened negative subjects, matched by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical examination and an informant interview were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases were identified using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Revised Third Edition diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Independently from the clinical diagnosis, a principal components factor analysis was carried out to investigate groupings among the clinical data (factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factor scores, calculated as a weighted sum of the symptom variables and converted to a standard score form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four major factors were found: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, disturbed behavior, and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison of these factors with the clinical diagnoses showed that (1) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> factor discriminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> cases from nondemented; (2) the cerebrovascular disease factor discriminated vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from AD cases and nondemented; (3) the disturbed behavior factor discriminated AD cases from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases and nondemented, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> characteristic of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This finding, if replicated, would have implications for the construction of diagnostic criteria for AD </plain></SENT>
