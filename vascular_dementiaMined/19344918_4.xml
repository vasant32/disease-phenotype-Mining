<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) generalizes across (a) these two types of memory, and (b) encoding, storage, and retrieval within RetM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding knowledge regarding these issues is sparse in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was, therefore, to compare the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiologies regarding patterns of impairment in ProM and RetM tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From a population-based study, 21 persons with VaD, 79 with AD, and 352 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups were impaired on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ProM and RetM variables, but did not differ from one another on any measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed relative to a network view of episodic memory, in which alterations at different sites may result in similar functional impairments </plain></SENT>
