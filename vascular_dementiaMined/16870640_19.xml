<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of total tau protein (t-tau), amyloid beta42 protein (Abeta42), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) are useful biomarkers to distinguish AD patients from VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured CSF levels of p-tau181, Abeta42, and t-tau in 86 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD or VaD and in 30 control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Optimal differentiation between AD and VaD was achieved by using the ratio of the CSF levels of Abeta42 and p-tau181 (Q Abeta42/p-tau) with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; or = 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support further efforts to prospectively validate the use of Q Abeta42/p-tau as a biomarker to discriminate between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
