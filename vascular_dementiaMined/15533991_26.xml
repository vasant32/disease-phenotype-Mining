<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 265 depressed individuals and 138 healthy, nondepressed controls age 60 and older who completed at least 1 year of follow-up data underwent periodic clinical evaluation by a geriatric psychiatrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of 141 patients and 137 controls had neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A consensus panel of experts reviewed 63 depressed subjects with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven individuals in the depressed group were assigned diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 8 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 25 individuals had other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and 11 were considered cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among elderly controls, 2 developed substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the depressed group, the incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for this age are much higher than would be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with prior evidence linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and later <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to examine neuroimaging and genetic, clinical, and social predictors of neurocognitive decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
