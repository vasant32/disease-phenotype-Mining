<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent pathological studies report vascular pathology in clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and AD pathology in clinically diagnosed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of vascular brain injury (white matter hyperintensities [WMH] and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) with neurodegenerative measures (medial-temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> [MTA] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> [CA]) in clinically diagnosed subjects with either AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then examined relationships among these measures within and between the two groups and their relationship to mental status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Semi-quantitative MRI measures were derived from blind ratings of MRI scans obtained from participants in a research clinical trial of VaD (N = 694) and a genetic epidemiological study of AD (N = 655) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CA was similar in the two groups, but differences in the mean of MTA and WMH were pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly associated with CA in VaD but not in AD; MTA and WMH were associated with CA in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WMH was associated with MTA in both groups; however, MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with MTA in VaD but not with MTA in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTA was strongly associated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both groups, whereas evidence of a modest association between WMH and Mini-Mental State Examination scores was seen in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI data from two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cohorts with differing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiologies find that the clinical consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are most strongly associated with cerebral and medial-temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, suggesting that tissue loss is the major substrate of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
