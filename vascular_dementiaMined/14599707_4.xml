<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the correlation between (1) the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) (including the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) score and three clock drawing tests (CDT) and (2) the three CDTs independently, in a specialized outpatient psychogeriatric service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen subjects completed a comprehensive evaluation and were allocated to one of the following groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) in 52; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) in 36; non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ND; Mood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Disorders) in 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the entire sample of patients is considered, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three CDTs used were highly and significantly correlated to the MMSE score, the CAMCOG score, and to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this patient population, these cognitive tests may be interchangeable for providing an initial objective measure of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when the same correlations were studied in the separate diagnostic groups, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group (DAT and VD) even though the high correlations between the various CDTs themselves did not change, the correlations between the MMSE score, the CAMCOG score and the CDTs decreased, more evidently in the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This trend became even more conspicuous in the ND group, where some of the above mentioned correlations became non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that in a real clinical situation the clinician initially assumes the role of cognitive "evaluator" (in terms of the total sample) followed by the role of cognitive "monitor" (in relation to specific diagnostic groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first instance, CDTs, the MMSE, and the CAMCOG might be considered interchangeable as an initial objective measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>, while in the second role, different CDTs might be diversely used, presumably supplemented by other cognitive tests and clinical methods </plain></SENT>
