<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 365 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who were referred to the Memory Clinic of Niigata Rehabilitation Hospital, Niigata, Japan over 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 85% of the patients lived in the communities within 15 km from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) age at examination was 79.3 +/- 6.9 years, and according to this criterion the patients were classified into 4 groups: young (age less than 65 years), younger-old (65-74 years), older-old (75-84 years), oldest-old (85 years or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient group, we evaluated the rates of the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients was as follows: AD, 74.5%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), 13.7%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>), 3.0%; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 5.5%, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients included in the young group was 9; in the younger-old group, 75; in the older-old group, 203; and in the oldest-old group, 78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in each old group was as follows: in the younger-old group, 74.7% for AD, 9.3% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 6.7% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, 5.3% for VD and 4.0% for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>; in the older-old group, 73.4% for AD, 15.8% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 1.5% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, 5.9% for VD, and 3.5% for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>; and in the oldest-old group, 78.2% for AD, 14.1% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 2.6% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, 3.9% for VD and 1.3% for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AD patients in the oldest-old group showed a significantly higher rate of female (younger-old, 64.3%; older-old, 79.2%; and oldest-old, 85.3%; chi2 = 7.9, p &lt; .05), a poorest mean of the score on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale (younger-old, 18.5 +/- 10.4; older-old, 19.2 +/- 9.3; and oldest-old, 22.8 +/- 7.6; F = 3.5, p &lt; .05), and a poorest distribution on the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (chi2 = 13.9, p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rates of the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were similar in the younger-, older-, and oldest-old groups except for the higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> and the lower rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, respectively, in the younger-old patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cognitive and overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity status of the oldest-old patients with AD referred to the memory clinic was poor than that of the younger- and older-old patients </plain></SENT>
