<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Throughout the 1990s a variety of schemes for the diagnosis of Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were proposed, including the ADDTC criteria for Ischemic Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, the NINDS-AIREN criteria for Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, Bennett's criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria for Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective analysis of a series of ambulatory outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to determine the prevalence with which patients were diagnosed by each of these diagnostic schemes, and to survey the clinical characteristics associated with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the diagnostic schemes for VaD were not interchangeable; patients diagnosed with VaD using one set of criteria were not necessarily diagnosed with VaD using other criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical characteristics associated with VaD, regardless of the diagnostic scheme that was used, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, extensive periventricular and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> on MRI (leukoaraiosis), and differential impairment on neuropsychological tests that assess the ability to establish/maintain mental set and visuoconstruction, with relatively higher scores on tests of delayed recognition memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the majority of VaD patients obtained low scores on the Modified Ischemic Scale, since cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and a history of a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and/or step-wise decline in cognitive function were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the current diagnostic schemes for VaD do not necessarily consider the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new paradigm that seeks to describe, in addition to diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with cerebrovascular disease is discussed </plain></SENT>
