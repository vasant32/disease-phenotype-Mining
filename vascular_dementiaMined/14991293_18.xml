<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Diminished mobility often accompanies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and has a great impact on independence and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New treatment strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are emerging, but the effects on gait remains to be studied objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review we address the general effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on gait as revealed by quantitative gait analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature search with the (MESH) terms: '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>' and 'gait disorders' in Medline, CC, Psychlit and CinaHL between 1980-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main inclusion criteria: controlled studies; patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; quantitative gait data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven publications met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> compared gait in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) with healthy elderly controls; one also assessed gait in Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methodology used was inconsistent and often had many shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were several consistent findings: walking velocity decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to healthy controls and decreased further with progressing severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VaD was associated with a significant decrease in walking velocity compared to AD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was associated with a shortened step length, an increased double support time and step to step variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Gait in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is hardly analyzed in a well-designed manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the literature suggests that quantitative gait analysis can be sufficiently reliable and responsive to measure decline in walking velocity between subjects with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More research is required to assess, both on an individual and a group level, how the minimal clinically relevant changes in gait in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients should be defined and what would be the most responsive method to measure these changes </plain></SENT>
