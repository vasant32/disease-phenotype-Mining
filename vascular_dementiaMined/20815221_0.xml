<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The cerebral cortex of fetal Wistar rats after 16- 17 gestation days were collected and randomized into Ruiqi tablet group and blank control group after 4-5 days' culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser scanning confocal microscope was adopted to determine the changes in the mitochondrion activities of the primary cultured cerebral cortex neurons of fetal rats after addition of Ruiqi tablet solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Ruiqi tablet can increase the mitochondrion activities of the cerebral cortex neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant change in the mitochondrion activities of the cerebral cortex neurons was found in the blank control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ruiqi tablet can increase the mitochondrion activities of the neurons and it has certain application prospects in treatment of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and so on </plain></SENT>
