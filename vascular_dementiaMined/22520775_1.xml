<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary care services are often the main healthcare service for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; as such, good-quality care at this level is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To measure the quality of care provided to people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in general practice using routinely collected data, and to explore associated patient and practice factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational, cross-sectional review of medical records from general practices (n = 52) in five primary care trusts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 994 people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unweighted quality-of-care score was constructed using information collected in the annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> review, together with pharmacological management of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multilevel modelling was carried out to identify factors associated with quality-of-care scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 599 out of 745 (80%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had received an annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> review; however, a social care review or discussion with carers was evident in just 305 (51%) and 367 (61%) of those 599 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, over a quarter (n = 259, 26%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>; only 57% (n = 148) of these had undergone medication review in the previous 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who were registered with single-handed practices received poorer quality of care than those registered with practices that had more than one GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the number of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with a record of an annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> review is high, the quality of these reviews is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The quality score developed in this study could be used as one source of data to identify weaknesses in practice activity that need to be corrected, and so would be of value to commissioners and regulators, as well as practices themselves </plain></SENT>
