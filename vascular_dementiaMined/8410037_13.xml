<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was divided into two phases: a door to door survey of the entire population aged 40 years and over (503 persons), followed by a clinical examination of suspected cases for positive and differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was 3.6% in individuals of 40 years and over and 7.1% in individuals of 65 years and over, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was found in 2.6% and 5.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of both clinical conditions increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent clinical category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type, which represented 1.8% and 3.8% of these two age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0.4% and 0.9% and for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 0.4% and 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> is an age-dependent disorder with a high prevalence among the elderly; some of these patients may represent an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, suggesting that the prevalence of this disorder may be higher than previously estimated </plain></SENT>
