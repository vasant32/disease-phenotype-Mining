<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TLJN belongs to the ethnopharmacological family of medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the TLJN effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of TLJN on β-amyloid-degrading enzymes and learning and memory in the AD rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD rats whose disease was induced by Aβ(25-35) injection into the bilateral hippocampus CA1 region were subjected to intragastric administration of various preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental animals were healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats which were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham, model, TLJN min, TLJN max and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4696">donepezil hydrochloride</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behavior, which are regarded as measures of spatial learning and memory, were investigated using Y-maze testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to observe the therapeutic effect of TLJN on the deposits of amyloid plaque and on the expression of synaptophysin, insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Y-maze results showed that the AD model group presented with spatial learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> staining indicated neuronal impairment and deposits of amyloid plaque in the model group and these results were consistent with their learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in the Y-maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TLJN-treated groups exhibited prolonged a cavity delitescence, decreased arm entries and improvement in learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the structure of the neurons of the treated groups was restored and the expression of synaptophysin increased in both the hippocampus and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, their levels of insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin in the cortex and hippocampus were upregulated and the amyloid plaque was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLJN can improve learning and memory, up-regulate insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin levels, promote the degrading of Aβ and clear amyloid plaque from the AD rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In future, TLJN may have significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of AD patients </plain></SENT>
