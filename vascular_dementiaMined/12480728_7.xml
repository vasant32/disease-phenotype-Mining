<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Hisayama study, an epidemiological study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a Japanese elderly population aged 65 years or older, has shown that the prevalence of VaD decreased for men, while AD remained unchanged in both sexes during a 7-year follow-up period (1985-1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased prevalence of VaD seems to be due to decreased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in recent years, resulting from the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was approximately 20 per 1000 person-years in either sex; VaD was more frequent for men and AD for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for VaD were age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and alcohol consumption, while age was only a significant risk factor for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the Hisayama study failed to demonstrate the relationship of vascular factors to AD, the previously reported studies suggest that either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> per se or blood pressure changes appear to partially participate in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
