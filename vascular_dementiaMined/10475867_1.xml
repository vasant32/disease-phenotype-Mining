<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between factors unrelated to the disease process, the duration of symptoms and the degree of cognitive or functional impairment in elderly patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The living situation, educational level, age, gender and diagnosis based on standardized criteria were recorded for 209 elderly patients presenting to a memory clinic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and functional deficits were measured with the cognitive section of the Cambridge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly Examination combined with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the abbreviated version of the Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 129 patients had a diagnosis of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 19 had probable ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 61 had mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no effect of diagnosis on duration of symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients living with a son or daughter were more functionally impaired than those living alone or with a spouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Males had higher cognitive scores but did not have milder functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with only a primary-school education had a trend towards lower cognitive scores at presentation but did not have more functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The gender of the patient and the relationship to the carer are associated with cognitive and functional scores at the time of presentation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
