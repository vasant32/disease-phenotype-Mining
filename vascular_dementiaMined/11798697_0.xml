<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 42 male and female senile Wistar rats were randomized into control and experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group was subdivided into A, and C three groups and the experimental group into 6 subgroups, i.e 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> alone and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> combined with reperfusion of 1 h, 6 h, 2 d, 4 d and 9 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Swimming maze was performed before and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contents of NGF and BDNF in different parts of brain were examined in different periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion with ABC method of immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NGF expression in frontal lobes reached a peak level in 2 days after reperfusion and then disappeared quickly, that in parietal lobes showed a moderate level in 15 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reached a peak in 9 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there is no expression in thalamus in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, but reexpression occurred after 2 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BDNF expression showed a peak level after 2 days of reperfusion and then decreased in frontal lobes, but a high level of expression that was unchanged in parietal lobes and hippocampal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increasing expression in thalamus occurred only 9 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distribution of BDNF was wider than that of NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a good protective action of NGF and BDNF in frontal lobes in the early period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion and there existed persistent and prompt action of the neurotrophic factors in parietal lobes and hippocampal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The protective action of NGF in thalamus was poor, but that of BDNF was good </plain></SENT>
