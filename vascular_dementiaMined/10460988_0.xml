<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several recent epidemiological investigations have shown that the rate of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) has decreased and the rate of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type has increased in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous neuropathological examination, such a trend but no significant differences were shown in nursing home residents in Shimane Prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether or not the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> (CI) and the ratio of CI [large infarction type (LI) and small multiple infarction (MI)] types changed between the first half of this study and the second half, corresponding to the decreasing trend of the rate of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and ten aged nursing home residents (146 men and 164 women) were evaluated neuropathologically in Shimane prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects died between 1976 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age +/- standard deviation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 79.1+/-8.7 years for men, 83.4+/-7.8 for women, and 81.4+/-8.5 overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were placed into the first or second study group and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) decreased significantly from the first half of the study to the second half in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) The frequencies of CI and CI with HT were not significantly different between the first and second half (both men and women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) There was a decreasing trend in the ratio of LI to MI from the first to the second period in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There may be no effect of the incidence of HT on CI frequency and some effects on CI types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CI in total lifespan (both men and women) has not changed in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recent decreasing trend in LI in men may have contributed to the decreasing tendency in the prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
