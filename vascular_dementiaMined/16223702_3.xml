<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article was to examine the differences in neuropsychological test performance between groups with Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients included in this study were those diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) or Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) through a series of neuroradiological tests that included at a minimum a CT or MRI scan and a SPECT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 113 AD patients, the average age was 80.08 (SD = 5.91) years and average education was 12.85 (SD = 2.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 109 VAD patients, average age was 78.67 (SD = 5.35) and average education was 13.10 (SD = 2.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tests included selected subtests of the WAIS-R, Word Fluency, Rey Figure, Boston Naming Test, Math, Reading, and subtests from the WMS-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five tests showed significant differences in favor of the VAD group: Information, Similarities, Picture Completion, WRAT Mathematics, and the Boston Naming Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups did well on Reading, while both did poorly on the Rey and Word Fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although both groups did poorly on memory measures, the VAD patients showed better performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the two groups did not differ significantly on the more complex tests, but did differ on more basic tests and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the memory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern of similar score on complex tests and different scores on basic tests demonstrates the theory that both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> affected higher, more complex skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences between the groups were only apparent when basic skills were compared and were not reflected in more complex and neuropsychologically "sensitive" tests </plain></SENT>
