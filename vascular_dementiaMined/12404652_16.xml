<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among consecutively referred volunteers with memory complaints to a research out-patient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cognitive screening tests (MMSE and CCSE) were performed according to established protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resulting combined screening test (termed by acronym as CMC) combined the non-overlapping test items derived from both MMSE and CCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up served as the 'gold-standard' for evaluating correctness of CMC for identifying MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 351 subjects completing cognitive assessments and meeting requirements for study protocol, 84 (23.9%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of different types within 3-6 years (3.89 +/- 2.17) of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these, 47 met criteria for probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), 22 for probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 12 for mixed AD/VaD and three for probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When final diagnosis of AD was used as the 'gold standard' for testing correctness of MCI identified by cognitive screening tests, sensitivities of MMSE, CCSE and CMC for identifying MCI were relatively 61.0%, 74.3% and 83.1% with minimum specificity set at 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was used as the standard for testing predictive correctness of MCI, CCSE emerged as an optimal MCI screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combining the CCSE and MMSE screening tests resulted in higher sensitivity than was achieved by MMSE alone and maintained specificity at comparable levels for identifying MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed that CMC has optimal correctness and utility as a brief cognitive test for screening MCI as a prodrome for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly populations </plain></SENT>
