<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in this vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group was only 6.8 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pronounced disturbances of the serotoninergic and cholingergic systems were found in subcortical and cortical grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These widespread neurotransmitter changes can hardly be explained by the localized brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> per se, but suggest the existence of another category of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the neurotransmitter disturbances were found to be similar to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, it seems more likely that they indicate a common pathway for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders than that they serve as markers of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories </plain></SENT>
