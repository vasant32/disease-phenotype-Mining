<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal naming, profession naming, and the summed score (animal + profession naming) were shown to be profoundly affected by demographical variables, especially age and educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical utility of the newly established regression-based VFT norms was evaluated in a large sample of psychogeriatric patients (N=1,063, of which n=890 met the criteria for Alzheimer's or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the animal naming VFT score was the most sensitive measure to distinguish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (when the specificities of the various VFT measures were equated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were found to commit stuck-in-set <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e>, i.e. they generated animal names during test administration of the profession naming VFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of stuck-in-set <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseveration</z:e> was 11.3% in Parkinson <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and frontal variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, versus 4.6% and 5.3% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analyses revealed that people who committed stuck-in-set <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> were more deficient on a measure of free recall and on several tests of executive control, such as the Expanded Mental Control Test, the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale and the Alternating Graphical Sequences Test as a measure of response inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the Alternating Graphical Sequences Test retained an independent effect in the association with stuck-in-set <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseveration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
