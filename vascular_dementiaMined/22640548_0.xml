<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare duration from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to diagnosis for young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (YOD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (LOD) and to assess the effect of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, gender, living situation, education and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on this duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method Data on 235 YOD and 167 LOD patients collected from caregivers from two prospective cohort studies were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the diagnosis of YOD exceeded that of LOD by an average of 1.6 years (2.8 v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Young age and being diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> were related to increases in the time to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> experienced shorter time to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to raise special awareness of YOD to facilitate a timely diagnosis </plain></SENT>
