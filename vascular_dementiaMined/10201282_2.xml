<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Hungarian post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population was examined to estimate the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and the applicability of a recently established Canadian diagnostic checklist in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular outpatients were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with a combined checklist: the Diagnostic Checklist for Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> established by the Consortium of Canadian Centres for Clinical Cognitive Research using the Mini Mental State Examination instead of the detailed neuropsychological part of the Checklist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 247 consecutive patients at a cerebrovascular outpatient unit, 176 had cerebrovascular disorder diagnosed either by computed tomography (CT; n=126) or by the clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 15% were cognitively impaired and 5% fulfilled the criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition (68.2+/-10.2 and 60.5+/-10.5 years, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Barthel index was significantly lower in the cognitively affected group than in non-affected patients (92.4+/-16.0 and 97.1+/-8.7, P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and more than two subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT or magnetic resonance imaging were more frequent in patients with cognitive loss (P=0.043 and P=0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was also influenced by the level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, motor deficits, and multiple subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined checklist appears to be a practical screening test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
