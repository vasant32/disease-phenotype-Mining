<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that mutant Notch3 shows a greater propensity to form aggregates, and these aggregates resist degradation, leading to accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we searched for low-molecular compounds that decrease the amount of mutant Notch3 aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a cell-based system, we found that degradation of preformed mutant aggregates was enhanced by treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53110">4,5-dianilinophthalimide</z:chebi> (DAPH) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> aglycone (SA), both of which inhibit amyloid β (Aβ) fibrillization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding other low-molecular compounds interacting with Aβ fibrils, thioflavin T (ThT) also enhanced the clearance of mutant Notch3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that DAPH, SA, and ThT are potent reagents to dissociate the preformed aggregates of mutant Notch3 by disruption of intermolecular contacts of misfolded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study may provide the basis for the development of a pharmacological therapy for CADASIL </plain></SENT>
