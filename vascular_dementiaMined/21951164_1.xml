<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study we have made use of a simple, novel, image-matching scoring system to assess the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in a group of 70 cases from the prospectively assessed Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases were found at autopsy to have cerebrovascular disease and no other pathology except Braak stage 4 or less tau pathology, and insufficient amyloid plaque pathology to meet Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (CERAD) criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathology scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> were correlated with cognitive scores [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and cognitive section of the Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> in the Elderly (CAMDEX) (CAMCOG)] at the last clinical assessment before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> pathology was inversely related to cognitive score before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.008 for MMSE and P &lt; 0.024 for CAMCOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one per cent and 33% of cases were rated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> by MMSE or CAMCOG respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was generally mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age did not influence severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An image-based scoring system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in a group of 70 elderly subjects enabled the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> pathology to be assessed with results that showed a significant correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> pathology severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
