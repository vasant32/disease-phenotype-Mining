<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, there are no widely accepted neuropathological criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, although creating such a standard is ranked high on the wish list of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the researchers in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such criteria would make it possible to perform large multicentre clinicopathological studies and, consequently, to better understand which, how, and where vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, as it is possible to do in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a major obstacle in the standardization of diagnosis is the fact that vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> are a large group comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> changes that have different pathogeneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it is accepted that some kinds of vascular changes cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, it is not uncommon to find reports of the assumed same histological changes in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An indispensable first step in the unequivocal establishment of neuropathological criteria is to uniform the definitions used for each one of the lesions, preferably based on its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present, non-standardized state of ambiguity, a given lesion is designated by different names between and within the clinical, radiological, and pathological settings, and several definitions simply overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before attempting to create new criteria, a multidisciplinary group-task is urged to identify and minimize the uncontrolled proliferation of definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only then, it will be possible to advance the understanding of how vascular brain changes affect cognition </plain></SENT>
