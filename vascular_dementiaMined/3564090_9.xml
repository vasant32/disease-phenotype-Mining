<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear magnetic resonance images were reconstructed at levels matching the pathologic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and, when available, quantitative comparisons between the results of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and pathology were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas of qualitatively prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times on nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were more extensive than the corresponding areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarction noted pathologically and were determined to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> plus the adjacent areas of Wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction, without evidence of blood on computed tomography, was found to have mildly prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times, between those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarction; a 10-day-old <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> had a very short T1, slightly shorter than that of white matter, and a mildly prolonged T2, with values between those of white and gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was found to have areas of prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times involving almost the entire white matter of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
