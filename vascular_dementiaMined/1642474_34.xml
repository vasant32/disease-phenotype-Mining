<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid concentration was also found to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to a lesser extent in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only other biochemical abnormality was an increased concentration of lysine, both in plasma and in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No organic acid abnormality was found on screening of asymptomatic family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were of either sex, and became symptomatic during childhood, with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental deficiency</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an identical abnormal pattern with subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo>, and signal changes in the putamina and dentate nuclei, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No specific biochemical function or catabolic pathway involving L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is known in mammals, including humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preliminary loading and dietary studies failed to reveal the origin of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevated CSF/plasma ratio suggests that it is in part generated within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This report describes a novel inherited neurometabolic disease, probably <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo>, with distinct clinical, biochemical, and neuroimaging features </plain></SENT>
