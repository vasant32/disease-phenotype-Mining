<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We examined the effect of stratification by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity on clinical and neuropsychological differences observed between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) to ascertain whether any observed phenotypic differences would differ between the early and late stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The phenotypic features at presentation of 219 newly diagnosed VaD (n = 103) and AD (n = 116) patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was staged using the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD can be clinically distinguished from AD by criterion-related features that span across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also identified non-criterion-related features that differed according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CDR 0.5-1 stage, VaD patients demonstrated increased reading difficulty, loss of insight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, and greater impairment in executive function compared with delayed and recognition memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unique distinguishing features for VaD in the CDR 2-3 stage included higher Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale scores, lower Barthel scores, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>gait apraxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic differences between VaD and AD can be conceptualized as either criterion-related stage-independent features, or stage-specific features (comprising cognitive and neuropsychological elements in the mild stages, and physical, affective and functional components in the later stages) </plain></SENT>
