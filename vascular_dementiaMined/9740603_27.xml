<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain has a role in blood pressure regulation; it is not clear whether the cerebral changes that occur with aging contribute to the decline in blood pressure in the very elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined a population-based sample of 484 85-year-old persons (344 nondemented and 140 demented, 61 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 65 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 14 with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) with a neuropsychiatric examination and blood pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, edition 3, revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was measured by CT of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the nondemented group, frontal (r=-0.18, P=0.037) and parietal (r=-0.23, P=0.008) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> and bifrontal ratio (r=-0.20, P=0.013) were associated with lower systolic blood pressure, and frontal (r=-0.23, P=0.010) and parietal (r=-0.24, P=0.008) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> and bifrontal ratio (r=-0.23, P=0.006) with lower diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was lower in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and diastolic blood pressure was lower in those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with the nondemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic (r=-0.27, P&lt;0.0001) and diastolic (r=-0.10, P=0.020) blood pressure was negatively correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006913'>frontal cortical atrophy</z:hpo> was correlated to lower diastolic blood pressure (r=-0.21, P=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that age-related changes in brain structure may contribute to the decrease in blood pressure in the very elderly and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>low blood pressure</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders is mainly a secondary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
