<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that up to 10% of individuals aged 65 years and older suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, most commonly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer Type (DAT) (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological studies are critical to our understanding of this disease and improving the accuracy of clinical diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine the validity of clinical diagnoses of DAT, to determine the prevalence of different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this sample, and to investigate the relationship between age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and polymorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Clinical data were available from 221 patients who had been examined at the Basel Memory Clinic between 1986 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this population, 34% (75 patients) were autopsied in the Department of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, and neuropathological examinations were additionally performed on 62 (83%) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and neuropathological data were retrospectively compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 67.8% of the neuropathologically examined patients received a definitive diagnosis of AD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD and VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD alone or with other histopathological hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the most prevalent neuropathological diagnosis (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VaD was deemed the only cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in only 4.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for DAT was 75.9%, the specificity 60.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing age was associated with an increasing number of clinical and neuropathological diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnoses of DAT found in our study are similar to previous reports (2-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older patients had more etiologies of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study reaffirms the need for internationally accepted criteria for clinical and neuropathological diagnoses, as well as further clinical-neuropathological investigations to further refine the clinical diagnostic process </plain></SENT>
