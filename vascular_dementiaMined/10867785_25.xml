<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an association between severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) and cerebrovascular lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), which is particularly strong for microinfarcts, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and multiple lesion types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> has also been associated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 (APOE4) genotype, which is in turn associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether severe CAA would be more strongly associated with cerebrovascular lesions than would APOE4 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 306 cases of autopsy-confirmed AD (from the University of California, San Diego, brain autopsy series) to assess whether APOE genotype and other clinical risk factors were predictive of vascular lesions (VLs) in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> severity was assessed using a semiquantitative scale in 4 brain regions (ie, hippocampus, midfrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and superior temporal cortex) and an average score was computed for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that severe CAA was associated with an increased frequency of VLs (33% of the cases of severe CAA had VLs vs 19% of the cases of mild or absent CAA; P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the APOE4/4 genotype was associated with an increased severity of CAA, there was no significant relationship between APOE genotype and frequency of VLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models showed that severe CAA, advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and Hachinski <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> Scale score of 7 or more were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with VLs, but the number of APOE4 alleles, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, sex, and serum cholesterol levels had nonsignificant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within strata of APOE genotype, the presence of severe CAA was associated with increased frequency of VLs (eg, within APOE4/4 homozygotes, VLs were present within 47% of the cases of severe CAA vs 9.5% of the cases of mild or absent CAA; P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe CAA confers a greater risk of VLs in AD, even within strata of APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the association between severe CAA and VLs in AD is not a spurious one owing to APOE4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, our cases of AD with APOE4 do not seem to be a more "vasculopathic" subtype of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which CAA produces VLs of various types need to be further elucidated, as these are probably important in producing the common entity of "mixed" AD/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
