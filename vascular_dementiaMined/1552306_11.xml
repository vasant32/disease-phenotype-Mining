<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination of the patients revealed similar profiles of walking even though their diagnoses were vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (2), Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (2), mixed Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (1), Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with parkinsonian features (1), and undetermined (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitatively, the patients' gait kinematics deviated greatly from control values, but these deviations were statistically attributable to reductions in stride </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbances</z:hpo> in elderly people are similar, regardless of etiology, because the characteristics of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbances</z:hpo> are heavily veiled by nonspecific stride-dependent changes that comprise the syndrome of senile gait </plain></SENT>
