<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate prevalence and incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and its risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in an elderly Italian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based cohort aged 65 and older resident in an Italian municipality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,016 subjects underwent baseline evaluation in 1999/2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2003/04, information about cognitive outcome was collected for 745 participants who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: MCI (classified as with or without impairment of the memory domain), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) diagnosed according to current international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall prevalence of MCI was 7.7% (95% confidence interval (CI)=6.1-9.7 %) and was greater with older age and poor education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 4 years of follow-up, 155 incident MCI cases were diagnosed, with an incidence rate of 76.8 (95% CI=66.8-88.4) per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of prevalent and incident MCI cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, multivariable-adjusted risk for progression from MCI with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 4.78 (95% CI=2.78-8.07) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 5.92 (95% CI=3.20-10.91) for AD, and 1.61 (95% CI=0.37-7.00) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk was found for MCI without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of MCI cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> did not progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MCI occurs often in this elderly Italian cohort and is associated with greater risk of AD, but only when the impairment involves the memory domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a substantial proportion of MCI cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> do not progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
