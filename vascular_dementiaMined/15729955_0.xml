<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies indicate that the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> can delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> is associated with natural killer activity alteration in AD and multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, as compared with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly and healthy young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective open study four groups of subjects (AD, VD, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly, and healthy young people) were treated with an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> drug (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> 12.5 mg/day or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> 400 mg twice daily) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cell cytotoxicity was measured after flow cytometry analysis before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 49 subjects studied, 15 had a diagnosis of AD (3 men, 12 women; mean age 83.5 +/- 8.1 years), 15 had a diagnosis of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> VD (7 men, 8 women; mean age 75.5 +/- 8.4), 13 were non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly (1 man, 12 women; mean age 80.2 +/- 7.2), and 6 were healthy young volunteers (3 men, 3 women; mean age 36.8 +/- 4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined subjects showed decreased NK cell cytotoxicity after treatment, this decrease was most prominent and statistically significant in elderly patients suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>--from an average of 30.5 +/- 11.8% before treatment to 22.5 +/- 16% after treatment (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity was only moderate and not statistically significant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other elderly and young subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young healthy volunteers exhibited a significantly higher total NK cytotoxicity before and after treatment compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> decrease NK activity in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that natural killer activity alteration cannot explain the ability of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> to delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or slow the progression of AD </plain></SENT>
