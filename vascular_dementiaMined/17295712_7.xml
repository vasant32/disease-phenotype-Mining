<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 240 patients underwent a comprehensive clinical, neuropsychological and MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A scale was developed quantify WML in anatomically defined regions by rating size and frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FLAIR sequences were used to determine a global and a frontal score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scores were correlated with the psychometric test results and the final clinical diagnosis: cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted curves for WML scores were calculated by means of a non-parametic smoothing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WML scores of the whole cerebrum and the frontal lobe were significantly increased in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as compared to CN, MCI and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual WML scores correlated significantly with age and neuropsychological test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the age range 55-72, the WML scores of VD were significantly different from those of CN, MCI and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age-corrected WML load was significantly higher in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as compared to MCI, AD and cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> over a wide age range </plain></SENT>
