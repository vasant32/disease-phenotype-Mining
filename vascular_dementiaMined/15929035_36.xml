<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this article is to compare number and size of neurons in CA1 in AD versus ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate the number and volume of neurons in 28 autopsy-derived brain samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each case, the entire hippocampus from one cerebral hemisphere was sliced into 5mm slabs (5-7 slabs/case), cut into 50 microm sections, and stained with gallocyanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the optical dissector, we systematically sampled the number and size of neurons throughout the extent of CA1 and CA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of neurons was significantly less in AD compared with ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.02), but there was no significant difference in neuron size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greatest loss of neurons was observed in two cases with combined AD and hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of causative diagnosis, the number of CA1 neurons correlates with magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume (r = 0.72; p &lt; 0.001) and memory score (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although CA1 neuron loss is more consistently observed in AD than ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, severity of loss shows the expected correlation with structure and function across causative subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reductions in magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume reflect loss, rather than shrinkage, of CA1 neurons </plain></SENT>
