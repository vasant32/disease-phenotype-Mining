<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several small scale clinical trials indicated a possible relationship between chemotherapy administration and the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, but little information was available from large population-based cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 62,565 women who were diagnosed with stages I-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> at age â‰¥65 years from 1991 through 2002 from 16 regions in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> at diagnosis with up to 16 years of follow-up, and also studied 9752 matched cohort based on the propensity of receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> was calculated and the time to event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>) analysis was conducted using Cox hazard regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, patients who received chemotherapy were 8% more likely to have drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with those without chemotherapy, but that was not statistically significant after adjusting for patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics (hazard ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval = 0.85-1.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> which was not significantly different between the 2 chemotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were somewhat similar in the entire cohort and the matched cohort based on the probability of receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no significant association between chemotherapy and the risk of developing drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and unspecified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study with long-term follow-up did not support the findings that chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of late stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
