<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, several attempts have been made to identify biochemical and/or genetic markers which might have diagnostic and prognostic uses for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To look for possible new blood markers, a longitudinal study was carried out in our Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> System Biomedical Research Center between October 1996 and July 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 AD subjects were diagnosed as AD patients according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, n= 17), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MXD, n = 18) and healthy age-matched control subjects (n = 15) have been included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples have been analysed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis) and the resulting protein patterns have been compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to examine the presence of peripheral markers among patients with AD, VD and MXD and to explore the relationship between serum markers and APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that two proteins of 19 and 20kDa molecular weight, respectively, might be associated with disease progression in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
