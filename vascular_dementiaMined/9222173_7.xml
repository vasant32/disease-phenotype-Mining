<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon 4 (apoE4) allele is associated with an increased proportion of vascular-related mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk of developing AD, with an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and may predispose to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the general population, apoE4 has been associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>shorter lifespan</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of data regarding the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) genotype upon the contributing causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> certificates of 114 AD cases were reviewed blind to apoE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>), cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and other causes were analyzed as a function of apoE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were employed to control for age and gender effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increased in association with the epsilon 4 allele (29% in cases without an epsilon 4 allele, 43% in cases with one epsilon 4 allele, 53% in epsilon 4/4 homozygous cases; p = 0.035 after corrections for age and gender) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase appeared largely due to an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, which was reported more frequently on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates of cases with one or more epsilon 4 allele (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.85 per epsilon 4 allele; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were nonsignificant trends for apoE4 to be associated with increased mortality related to cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.45) and decreased mortality related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (OR = 0.77) and AD itself (OR = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The epsilon 4/4 cases had significantly earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (mean = 64.5 yr), earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and longer duration of disease (mean = 10.1 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cases with one or more epsilon 4 allele tended to have lower mean MMSE scores prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6.6 versus 9.5) and were more often female (54% versus 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The apoE4 allele appears to increase the risk of vascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
