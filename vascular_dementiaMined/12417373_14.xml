<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Further to recent data indicating that patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) show a cholinergic deficit, we aimed to determine whether rivastigmine, a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), has any effects on the symptoms of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 65-80, with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and probable VaD, received rivastigmine 3-6 mg/day (n=8) or cardioaspirin (n=8) in an open study for 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 22 months, patients treated with rivastigmine showed significant improvements in executive function and behavioural symptoms (both p&lt;0.05 vs. both baseline and control group), which were reflected in reduced caregiver stress (p&lt;0.05 vs. baseline and controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline scores of global response, cognition, word fluency and activities of daily living were maintained in patients receiving rivastigmine, and there was no increase in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the control group showed no improvements in any domain, and significant deterioration in global response and executive function (both p&lt;0.05 vs. baseline and rivastigmine group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term rivastigmine treatment appeared to be safe and effective in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, improvements in domains particularly relevant to this condition were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These benefits may reflect the drug's dual inhibitory effects on the cholinergic system, and its particular activity in frontal areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large, double-blind study of rivastigmine in patients with VaD would be worthwhile </plain></SENT>
