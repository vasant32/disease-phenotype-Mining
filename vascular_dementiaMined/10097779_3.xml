<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated homecare patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT; n = 36) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD; n = 36) and their care-providing relatives regarding clinical and psychosocial variables to determine whether DAT and VD impose different burdens on caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were confirmed by internal medical, clinical-neurological, and psychiatric parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was graded according to the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caregiving relatives responded to the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale (BAD), the Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>), and the Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses revealed that caregivers' burden (SCB), disease symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality changes</z:hpo> of patients (BAD), and the patients' inability to cope with everyday tasks (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>) were sharply higher for DAT than for VD patients in the group with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning patients with mild or moderately severe disease, scores in the DAT group were similar or lower than those in the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In early stages, VD patients impose a greater burden on relatives than do patients with DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In severe stages this relationship undergoes a reversal, with relatives of DAT patients experiencing the burden more adversely than those of VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and course characteristics, as well as the specific differences between these two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with respect to caregiver burden factors, call for their diagnostic separation and the development of specific homecare support systems for family caregivers </plain></SENT>
