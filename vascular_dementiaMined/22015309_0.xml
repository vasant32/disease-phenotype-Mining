<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, we examined C677T and A1298C (rs1801133 and rs1801131) polymorphism in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) genes and their correlation with plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) in AD and VaD cases and evaluated the gene-gene interaction (epistasis) with IL-6-174 G/C (rs1800795) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CC genotype was associated with elevated levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (p = 0.004) as compared with genotype AA of rs1801131 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In AD, we observed a significant (p = 0.04) association with C alleles of rs1801131 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed that the presence of both rs1801133 T and rs1800795 C alleles increased the odds of developing AD by 2.5 and VaD by 3.7-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While rs1800795 (CC or GC) genotypes alone increased the odds of developing VaD by 2.2-fold, the presence of CC genotype of rs1801131 nullified this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings support the hypothesis that multiple genes are involved to alter the odds of developing AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
