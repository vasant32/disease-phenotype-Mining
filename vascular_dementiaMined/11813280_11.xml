<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with VaD display diverse cognitive and motor deficits, however, and relationships between these impairments and independent living abilities remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the contributions made by attentional/executive and motor functions in the prediction of basic and instrumental activities of daily living in 32 patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that: (a) motor abilities would emerge as a significant predictor of basic activities of daily living, whereas attentional/executive abilities would not, and (b) both motor and attentional/executive abilities would emerge as significant predictors of instrumental activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stepwise regression analyses revealed that motor performance, but not attentional/executive abilities, accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in basic activities of daily living, and that both motor and attentional/executive abilities contributed significantly to the prediction of instrumental activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that attentional/executive and motor impairments may underlie specific aspects of functional disability among patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
