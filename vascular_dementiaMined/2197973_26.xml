<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variable A4 immunostaining was seen within cortical (and rarely white matter) parenchyma in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> (with or without central cores), and within capillary and arteriolar walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within individual patients, A4 deposits were often primarily parenchymal or vascular, and when they were vascular they tended to be more prominent in arteriolar than in capillary wall segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perivascular A4 deposits were often detected around strongly immunoreactive microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gamma-trace immunoreactivity was noted in many A4-positive microvessel walls, but staining was always less intense than with the anti-A4 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> may show wide variation in the severity and topography of A4 deposits within brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A4 may colocalize with gamma-trace <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, suggesting that A4 and gamma-trace forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> may not be as biochemically distinctive as has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other proteases or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
