<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that peripheral tissue markers can provide information regarding changes affecting cellular metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that serum copper levels can discriminate subjects with AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (with 60% sensitivity and 95% specificity) and from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (with 63% sensitivity and 85% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between AD and serum levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition metals</z:chebi> and markers of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: General hospital inpatient wards and outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients A pair of elderly monozygotic female twins discordant for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biochemical analyses of peripheral-blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition metals</z:chebi> and indicators of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and neurologic and neuropsychological assessments of clinical status for presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum copper and total <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> levels were both 44% higher in the twin with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and a diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cases reported support the hypothesis of a major involvement of copper and oxidative abnormalities in AD </plain></SENT>
