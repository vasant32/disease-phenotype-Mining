<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we hypothesised that alcohol consumption might also affect the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the relation between alcohol consumption and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in individuals taking part in the Rotterdam Study--a prospective population-based study of 7983 individuals aged 55 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline (1990-93) and who had complete data on alcohol consumption (n=5395) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through follow-up examinations in 1993-94 and 1997-99 and an extensive monitoring system, we obtained nearly complete follow-up (99.7%) until the end of 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, education, smoking, and body-mass index, to compare the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> between individuals who regularly consumed alcohol and individuals who did not consume alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The average follow-up was 6.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During this period, 197 individuals developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (146 Alzheimer's disease, 29 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 22 other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median alcohol consumption was 0.29 drinks per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Light-to-moderate drinking (one to three drinks per day) was significantly associated with a lower risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 0.58 [95% CI 0.38-0.90]) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 0.29 [0.09-0.93]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence that the relation between alcohol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> varied by type of alcoholic beverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in individuals aged 55 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect seems to be unchanged by the source of alcohol </plain></SENT>
