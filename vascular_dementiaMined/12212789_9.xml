<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied the genetic and environmental risk factors and prevalence, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) among the elderly in an Arab community in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and genetic studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have rarely been reported in an Arab population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> persons aged 60 years or older who were residents of the rural area of Wadi Ara were examined for identification of DAT, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and conversion from age related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (ARCD) to DAT using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria and a semi-structured questionnaire for collection of demographic and medical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotype was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) was determined using HPLC with fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">Vitamins B12</z:chebi> and plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were determined using a commercial radioisotope dilution kit assay (ICN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DAT was diagnosed in 20.5% of this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its prevalence increased steeply with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Illiteracy was very common, and strongly associated with higher prevalence of DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of DAT among ARCD cases was 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ARCD who developed DAT were older than ARCD subjects who did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly more common among converted patients than among non-converted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Illiteracy was insignificantly more common among those who developed DAT than among those who remained ARCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) constitutes about 22% of the total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We also confirm the association between VaD, illiteracy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Smoking did not represent a risk factor for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The survival rates among the three groups (healthy subjects, ARCD and DAT) was 80.5%, 58.8% and 55.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher than found in studies in Cleveland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> and plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels did not differ significantly between DAT patients and controls after adjusting for year of birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Wadi Ara population is unique because of high prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We found old age, female gender and lack of education to be risk factors for the development of DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The ApoE epsilon4 allele is relatively uncommon in this population and it cannot explain the high DAT prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We also confirm the association between VaD, illiteracy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and older age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are risk factors for the transformation of ARCD to DAT </plain></SENT>
