<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> becomes widespread, many of these patients will be treated concomitantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and with anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> drugs to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the widespread use of this combination in clinical practice, the safety and tolerability of such combination therapy has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pilot study examined the effects of addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> 0.5-2 mg/day to patients on rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 65 patients suffering from AD, 10 from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 15 from both were randomized to open label rivastigmine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>, alone or in combination, for 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events caused by co-administration were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No clinically relevant adverse interactions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that rivastigmine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> can be safely co-administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these results in large clinical trials studies is warranted </plain></SENT>
