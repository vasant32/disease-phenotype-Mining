<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports showed that the dietary pattern in Japanese immigrants in Brazil, which characterized by a low fish and large meat intake, is possibly responsible for increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> compared with Japanese in Okinawa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 157 persons over 70-year-old were examined, and 19 cases were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence (cases/100 aged 70-year-older) was 12.1 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 5.7 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 0.6 for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 4.5 for mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD/VD) and 1.3 for other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to many previous studies in Western countries and some recent surveys in Japan, and clearly show that more AD than VD appears even in the Japanese-Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Japanese-Brazilians compared with several studies in Japan may indicate the importance of dietary factors rather than genetic factors </plain></SENT>
