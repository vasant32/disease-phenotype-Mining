<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), and body mass index (BMI) are predictors of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a 10-year follow-up study on 133 elderly who were institutionalized in a nursing home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of IL-1ß and IL-6 at both rest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, as well as HT, DM, and BMI at baseline, were analyzed with the incidences of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and AD during a 10-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and Cox regression analyses for the total of 133 subjects showed significantly higher incidences of both VD and AD in subjects with DM or HT at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resting IL-1ß or IL-6 value, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> score, was not significantly associated with the subsequent development of VD or AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analyses of 40 subjects who had shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> at least once in the previous 3 months demonstrated that IL-1ß and IL-6 values at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> stage were significantly associated with AD, but not with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that systemic inflammatory IL-1ß and IL-6 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> stage are risk factors for the development of AD, but not VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory mechanisms for AD seem to be causal and specific to the development of AD </plain></SENT>
