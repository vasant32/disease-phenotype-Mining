<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) is considered to be the most common pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to devise a diagnostic algorithm for VCI, and evaluate the reliability and validity of our proposed criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We based our new algorithm on previous literature, a Delphi consensus method, and preliminary testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, successive 100 patients with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in hospital underwent a structured medical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five case vignettes fulfilled the proposed criteria of diagnosis for probable or possible VCI were divided into three subtype categories: vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VCIND), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or mixed VCI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-raters reliability was assessed using a Fleiss kappa analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity was also evaluated by correlation coefficients (r) between the proposed key points for each subtype and the currently accepted criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with probable VCI were examined to determine the accuracy of identification for each subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proposed criteria showed clinical diagnostic validity for VCI, and were able to define probable, possible and definite VCI, three VCI subtypes, and vascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was good consensus between experts (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96 for both rounds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant moderate to good items-total correlations were found for two questionnaires (50-r range, 0.40 - 0.97 and 0.41 - 0.99, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant slight and moderate inter-raters reliability were obtained for VCI (k = 0.13) and three VCI subtypes (k = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, good convergent validity was observed in a comparison of significant correlations between criteria: good (4-r range, 0.75 - 0.92) to perfect (3-r = 1.00) validity for the VCIND subtype, and moderate to good validity for the VaD subtype (1-r = 0.46; 5-r range, 0.76 - 0.92) and for the mixed VCI/AD subtype (r = 0.92 and 1.00; 4-r range, 0.47 - 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the subtypes of VCIND, VaD and mixed VCI/AD were 0.85, 0.67 and 0.93, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the new VCI diagnostic algorithm might be a suitable clinical approach for assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
