<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both discrete lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and more diffuse ischaemic changes, seen as confluent high signal (leukoaraiosis) on T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is a weak correlation between T2 lesion load and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) is a new technique that may provide a better index of white matter damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether DTI measures are correlated more strongly with cognitive performance than lesion load on T2 weighted images, and whether these correlations are independent of conventional MRI parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 36 patients with ischaemic leukoaraiosis (leukoaraiosis plus a previous lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and 19 healthy volunteers underwent DTI, conventional MRI, and neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On DTI, diffusivity was increased both within lesions and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean diffusivity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter correlated with full scale IQ (r = -0.46, p = 0.009) and tests of executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These correlations remained significant after controlling for age, sex, brain volume, and T1/T2 lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was identified between T2 lesion load and IQ or neuropsychological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of conventional measures, brain volume correlated best with cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor measurements correlate better with cognition than conventional MRI measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They may be useful in monitoring disease progression and as a surrogate marker for treatment trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings support the role of white matter damage and disruption of white matter connections in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
