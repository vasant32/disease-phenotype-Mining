<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of rivastigmine in patients with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD with VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This 26-week open-label pilot study was conducted at 19 centres in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To reduce bias, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) raters were blinded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efficacy measures and to patient dosage information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with rivastigmine and titrated to their highest tolerated dose, up to 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy measure was cognitive function assessed by the ADAS-Cog subscale (without the concentration/distractibility item, to be consistent with cognitive outcome measures used in previous rivastigmine trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of patients treated with rivastigmine 6-12 mg/day demonstrated improvement on the ADAS-Cog at 26 weeks, with &gt;25% of patients having a clinically significant improvement of &gt; or =4 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rivastigmine (6-12 mg/day) was well tolerated by the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse effects occurring in &gt;10% of patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, dizziness and diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that rivastigmine treatment may have beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
