<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (age: 29-85 years; mean: 62) were divided into three groups: 7 VaD, 4 PVS, and 5 nondementia patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean velocity (Vm) in the middle and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) was measured, and time-intensity curves of the HPI were evaluated at three regions of interest-the bilateral temporal lobe (TL), basal ganglia (BG), and thalamus (Th) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD and HPI were evaluated before (resting state) and after ACZ administration, and vasoreactivity was compared among the three groups in terms of resting values and relative changes (%Delta) of Vm, peak intensity (PI), area under curve (AUC), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of the resting state: Decreased Vm, PI, and AUC of the VaD and PVS groups were more obvious in the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of vasoreactivity: In the PVS group, %DeltaVm decreased in the left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>; %DeltaPI and %DeltaAUC decreased in the left TL and bilateral BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the VaD group, %DeltaPI and %DeltaAUC decreased in the right TL; %DeltaMTT tended to increase in the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACZ vasoreactivity tests by transcranial HPI and TCD allowed bedside, noninvasive quantitative evaluation of the pathophysiology of cognitive function impairment in relation to cerebrovascular reserve capacity in VaD and PVS </plain></SENT>
