<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous research has yielded conflicting evidence regarding the long-term cognitive outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have found evidence for a higher incidence of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while others have refuted this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, neuropsychological performance, functional ability and clinical variables were assessed in a sample of patients who had been hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> 25 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were available on 71 depressed patients (10 of whom were deceased) and 50 surgical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between depressed subjects and controls on any neuropsychological measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten depressed patients but no controls were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up (continuity corrected chi2 = 5.93, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was predicted by older age at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the most common type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this study did not find evidence that early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but that for a small subgroup there appears to be a link with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several plausible explanations for this link, such as lifestyle factors, require further investigation </plain></SENT>
