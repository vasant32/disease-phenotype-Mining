<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) may help to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results, however, are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 6989 subjects 55 years of age or older who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at base line, in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To detect new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, follow-up screening was performed in 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997 through 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was estimated in relation to the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> as documented in pharmacy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined four mutually exclusive categories of use: nonuse, short-term use (1 month or less of cumulative use), intermediate-term use (more than 1 but less than 24 months of cumulative use), and long-term use (24 months or more of cumulative use) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustments were made by Cox regression analysis for age, sex, education, smoking status, and the use or nonuse of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> Hz-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 6.8 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> developed in 394 subjects, of whom 293 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 56 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 45 other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 0.95 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.29) in subjects with short-term use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.11) in those with intermediate-term use, and 0.20 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.83) in those with long-term use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk did not vary according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was not associated with a reduction in the risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> but not against vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
