<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no published data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in any of the Arabic countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the different sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among Qataris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective and prospective ongoing hospital-based study in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medical records of the patients with diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> seen at the Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar, between June 1997 and June 2003, whether inpatient or outpatient were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined according to diagnostic and statistical manual (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>) IV criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were evaluated by a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist and a geriatrician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had brain computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or both and routine blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, they were classified into sub-types according to the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 300 patients, 134 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, most of them were illiterate, married and non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among those <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sub-types were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) 39 (29%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) 30 (22%), mixed AD and VaD 20 (15%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 8 (6%) were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rest of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to other medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed that AD is more prevalent than VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It also showed that patients and their families seek medical help late due to the general belief among the public that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>forgetfulness</z:hpo> and other associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> are part of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The emergence of new drugs and advancement in the prevention of cerebrovascular diseases makes early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sub-type important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A community based study, to show the real prevalence and incidence of sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, is highly indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data are necessary for planning and setting up community services and health care programs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
