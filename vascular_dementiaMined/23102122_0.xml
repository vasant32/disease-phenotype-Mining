<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neuropsychological tests and the Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) can differentiate incident vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) in nondemented older adults within 5 years of initial testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) included three waves: CSHA-1 (1991-1992), CSHA-2 (1996-1997), and CSHA-3 (2001-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis included participants of the CSHA who (a) underwent neuropsychological testing and clinical assessment at CSHA-2 and were determined to be nondemented, and (b) underwent diagnostic assessment at CSHA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was CSHA-3 diagnosis, classified as VaD (n = 22), probable or possible AD (n = 65), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other diagnostic outcomes (n = 417) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSHA-3 diagnosticians were blinded to CSHA-2 test scores and diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression with forward selection was used to determine the ability of the HIS and 15 CSHA-2 neuropsychological tests to predict CSHA-3 diagnostic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis was repeated after removing 15 AD cases with coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HIS and four neuropsychological tests were significant predictors of CSHA-3 diagnostic outcome (Ï‡2 (14) = 149.59, P &lt; .001, R2 = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to developing VaD, higher HIS (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.86) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate verbal recall scores (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.97) were associated with lowered odds of developing AD, whereas higher phonemic fluency scores (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.02-1.17) were associated with increased odds of developing AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Removing AD cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> did not affect results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an epidemiological sample of nondemented participants, the HIS and two neuropsychological tests contributed to the differential prediction of VaD and AD within 5 years of initial measurement </plain></SENT>
