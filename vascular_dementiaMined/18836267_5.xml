<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It still remains unclear, however, whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> may present with localized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify the local rCBF changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects consisted of 15 patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: 20 +/- 3.5] without apparent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group), 11 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with white matter lesions (non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-WML group) and 16 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were right-handed and underwent brain perfusion single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of the differences in the SPECT rCBF was performed by SPM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of severity of the WMLs was evaluated based on the Scheltens rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of SPM analysis revealed that the rCBF in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group was significantly decreased in the pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus of both sides as compared with that in the controls, and in the left pulvinar nucleus as compared with that in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-WML group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, SPM analysis revealed no significant reduction in rCBF in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-WML group as compared with that in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The WMLs in the left parietal region were severer in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group than in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-WML group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> without apparent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, significant rCBF reduction in the bilateral pulvinar nuclei as compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and in the left pulvinar nucleus as compared with that in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with WMLs was found </plain></SENT>
