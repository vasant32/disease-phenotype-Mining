<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFFT) is a psychophysical threshold and in psychological terms is regarded as a measure of information processing capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The test has previously been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> functioning in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and may be a useful as a screening measure for the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive referrals to the Wakefield Memory Clinic who met <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for AD or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were invited to take part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A range of neuropsychological tests and CFFT were administered to the two groups using standardised protocols and the ability of these various tests to distinguish between the two conditions was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the various tests, only the descending component of CFFT and word fluency were significantly different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the descending threshold had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CFFT could be useful as a screening instrument for early AD when combined with other measures and could facilitate the decision to commence antidementia treatment at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal work is needed to establish this </plain></SENT>
