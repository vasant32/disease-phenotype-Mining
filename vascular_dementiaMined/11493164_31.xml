<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about how cerebrovascular disease affects progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have found no differences in progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but these studies have not specifically examined age effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with associated cerebrovascular disease in clinical and autopsy patient series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the longitudinal course of cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with clinically and neuropathologically diagnosed conditions evaluated through a university <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical patients were grouped according to possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 37), probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 181), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy cases were categorized into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (n = 78) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using random-effects modeling of longitudinal change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between age and diagnosis in determining rate of change on the MMSE scores for both the clinical and autopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rate of change decreased slightly with advancing age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> groups, but increased with age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with cerebrovascular disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> with cerebrovascular disease declined faster in patients 80 years and older compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> without associated cerebrovascular pathological conditions, but showed slower decline in patients younger than 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect most likely reflects combined Alzheimer and vascular pathological conditions in older patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
