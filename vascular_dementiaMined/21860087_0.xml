<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess whether there is a difference in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile, of selected proteins, between patients with VaD and MD with subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>), AD, and healthy controls that could contribute in the separation of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 30 controls, 26 SVD patients (9 VaD and 17 MD) and 30 AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein panel included total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau(181)), amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ(1-42)), neurofilament light (NF-L), myelin basic protein (MBP), heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and -10), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and -2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical methods were utilized for quantification of the proteins in CSF and data analysis was performed with a multivariate discriminant algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of MBP, TIMP-1, P-tau(181), NF-L, T-tau, MMP-9, Aβ(1-42), and MMP-2 contributed the most to the separation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and AD, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 90% (AUC = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MBP and NF-L performed the best in discriminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> from controls, while T-tau and Aβ(1-42) contributed the most in segregating AD from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF biomarkers reflecting AD pathology (T-tau, P-tau(181), and Aβ(1-42)), white matter lesions (NF-L and MBP) and matrix remodeling (MMP-9 and TIMP-1) perform well in differentiating between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and AD patients </plain></SENT>
