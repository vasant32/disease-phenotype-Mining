<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This prospectively designed longitudinal study assesses prevalence, incidence and prognosis of depressive symptoms among cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly volunteers compared with patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Possible relationships between depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, disease types, and effects of antidepressant treatment were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and ninety four subjects exhibiting different levels of cognitive performance were admitted to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative risk factors, together with measures of neuropsychological test performance, were obtained at sequential visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were selectively treated with antidepressant medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and forty six subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, 19 subjects with MCI, 42 patients with DAT, and 32 patients with VAD were followed for a mean of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the passage of time, there were trends showing prevalence of depressive symptoms to decrease among DAT and to increase among VAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VAD patients exhibited the highest incidences of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> depressive symptoms, followed in incidence by DAT and MCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms among VAD and MCI patients were more persistent and refractory to antidepressant medications than for DAT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Trends suggested that antidepressant treatment might benefit MCI and VAD subjects more than DAT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Motivationally related depressive symptoms accounted for major components of elevated Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> rating scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms among DAT patients have higher rates of spontaneous resolution, without requiring intensive drug treatment, than among VAD patients in whom depressive symptoms are more persistent and refractory to drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early depressive symptoms among subjects with MCI may represent a preclinical sign and should be considered as a risk factor for impending DAT or VAD among the elderly </plain></SENT>
