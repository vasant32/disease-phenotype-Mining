<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from a genome scan showed strongest linkage to 20p13 in 18 families, and subsequent fine mapping was performed with both microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 18 selected candidate transcripts in an extended sample set of 30 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The multipoint linkage peak was located at marker rs2144151 in the ANGPT4 gene, which is a strong candidate gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> because of its involvement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of the linkage decreased, we find this result intriguing, considering that we included additional families, and thus the reduced linkage signal may be caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
