<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since some vascular causes can be prevented and treated, the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> exhibit higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after stoke is still in question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the relative frequency of first-ever post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSD) (three months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) in a consecutive sample of our population, 2) the risk factors associated with PSD, and 3) the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels and PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-one inpatients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated with a neuropsychological battery and event-related evoked potentials (P300) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and then after three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A wide range of demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory variables were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PSD was diagnosed if the clinical presentation fulfilled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the patient scored &lt;/=21 on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and &lt;/=67 points on Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PSD was diagnosed in 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PSD was significantly associated with increasing age, low levels of education, large sized and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e>, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, prolonged P300 latency, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels increased the odds ratio of PSD after adjustment of significantly relevant variables including age, smoking, size of infarction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> is common after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that PSD may result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its related risk factors including possible direct association with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Better knowledge of the risk factors for PSD should increase the effectiveness of preventive strategies in patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
