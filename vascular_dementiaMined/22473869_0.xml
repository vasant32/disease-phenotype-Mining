<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS, as well as many trials registries and grey literature sources (27 October 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double-blind, randomized controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> given for at least 6 months in people with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent authors extracted and assessed data independently against the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were pooled where appropriate and entered into a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three studies were identified (748 participants, age range 50-90 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a diagnosis of probable or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> according to standard criteria, and most patients were established on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale cognitive subscale from baseline was a primary outcome in three studies; when data were pooled, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> did not provide any beneficial effect in this cognitive measure (mean difference -1.12; 95% confidence interval -3.99, 1.75; p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies provided a change in Mini-Mental State Examination from baseline; there was no significant benefit from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in this cognitive measure when the data were pooled (mean difference -1.53; 95% confidence interval -3.28; 0.21, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no studies identified assessing the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were detrimental to cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
