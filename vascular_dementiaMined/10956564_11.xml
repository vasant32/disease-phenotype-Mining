<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A consecutive series of 517 patients with probable and possible VaD or AD were evaluated for cognitive, functional, and behavioral symptoms and separated into three subgroups by duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These AD and VaD subgroups were then compared on a series of standardized clinical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only consistent trends were for VaD patients to be more depressed, more functionally impaired, and less cognitively impaired within each disease duration subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that there are few differences between clinically diagnosed VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subclassification of VaD into subgroups will improve the clinical utility of this nosologic entity </plain></SENT>
