<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and an exclusion of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> is important in many clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obtaining such a clinical diagnosis in epidemiological studies and clinical trials that recruit large numbers of patients is time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To construct an algorithm using a limited number of data points to generate a diagnosis of the commonest forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using information collected by non clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed a computer algorithm to generate a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy Bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or to flag the case as needing a clinical review based on a limited number of data points taken from a largely structured interview using widely used scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis generated in life by the algorithm in a prospective, longitudinal study was compared to definitive diagnosis at post mortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Post mortem diagnosis was available for 43 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the algorithm was greater than 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD was diagnosed by the algorithm and at post mortem in 36 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases with FTD were wrongly diagnosed as having AD by the algorithm, five cases were flagged as needing a clinical review due to concomitant medical conditions of whom four had AD and one, who had been diagnosed clinically as having AD, was diagnosed on post mortem with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combination of non-clinical researchers, a structured interview and a computerised algorithm is as effective at identifying AD as highly trained and skilled clinicians </plain></SENT>
