<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study aimed at mapping (i) the distributed electroencephalographic (EEG) sources specific for mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) compared to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly people (Nold) and (ii) the distributed EEG sources sensitive to the mild AD at different stages of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting EEG (10-20 electrode montage) was recorded from 48 mild AD, 20 VaD, and 38 Nold subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both AD and VaD patients had 24-17 of mini mental state examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG rhythms were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical EEG sources were modeled by low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding issue i, there was a decline of central, parietal, temporal, and limbic alpha 1 (low alpha) sources specific for mild AD group with respect to Nold and VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, occipital alpha 1 sources showed a strong decline in mild AD compared to VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, distributed theta sources were largely abnormal in VaD but not in mild AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding issue ii, there was a lower power of occipital alpha 1 sources in mild AD subgroup having more severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to previous field studies, this was the first investigation that illustrated the power spectrum profiles at the level of cortical (macroregions) EEG sources in mild AD patients having different severity of the disease with respect to VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should evaluate the clinical usefulness of this approach in early differential diagnosis, disease staging, and therapy monitoring </plain></SENT>
