<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shortened telomere length has been considered to be associated with various age-related diseases, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, changes in telomere length in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate these changes, we set out to determine telomere length in peripheral leukocytes as well as the level of urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and 35 age-matched, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly controls (NEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was assessed on the basis of urine 8-OHdG level, which was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomere length was significantly shorter in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> group than in the NEC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> group than in the NEC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between telomere length and age in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> group; however, there were no significant relationships between telomere length and clinical findings including disease duration, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, presence or absence of fluctuation in cognitive function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002367'>visual hallucinations</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the correlation between telomere length and urinary 8-OHdG levels was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the etiopathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> is considered to be an accelerated aging process </plain></SENT>
