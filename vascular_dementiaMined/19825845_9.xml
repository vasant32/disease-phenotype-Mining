<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cytotoxic properties of mutant Notch3 using stable cell lines with inducible expression of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or two mutants p.R133C and p.C185R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that both mutants of Notch3 were prone to aggregation and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The turnover rates of the mutated Notch3 proteins were strikingly slow, with half-lives greater than 6 days, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Notch3 was rapidly degraded, with a half-life of 0.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of mutant Notch3 also impaired cell proliferation compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Notch3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, cell lines expressing mutant Notch3 were more sensitive to proteasome inhibition resulting in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that prolonged retention of mutant Notch3 aggregates in the ER decreases cell growth and increases sensitivity to other stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the aggregate-prone property of mutant Notch3 contributes to a pathogenic mechanism underlying CADASIL </plain></SENT>
