<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied levels of pentosidine and N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 15 patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 20 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 31 control subjects (14 matched for age, and 17 younger patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AGE protein concentrations in CSF did not differ within controls when divided into two subgroups by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found significantly elevated levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in CSF of AD patients and of pentosidine in CSF of patients suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of pentosidine and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in serum apparently did not relate directly to CSF values, suggesting influence of extra-cerebral factors in serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that AGE proteins are differentially affected in these types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, depending on the specific neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, measurements of AGE products in vivo should rely on CSF rather than blood samples </plain></SENT>
