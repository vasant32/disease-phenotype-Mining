<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD have been proposed (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers [ADDTC], 1992; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 4th edition [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV], 1994; International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10], 1992, 1993; and National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences [NINDS-AIREN], 1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now the clinical feasibility of these diagnostic guidelines has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study aimed to compare these criteria in an unselected sample of 167 elderly patients (mean age, 72.0 +/- 9.9 years) admitted with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of cases that could be classified as VD differed widely between the various diagnostic guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, 45 cases were diagnosed as VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases fulfilled the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 research criteria, but only 12 met the NINDS-AIREN criteria for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three cases were classified as ischemic VD as defined by the ADDTC criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concordance was very poor since only 5 cases met the criteria for VD of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the classification according to different diagnostic guidelines yields rather distinct groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reasons responsible for these findings are as follows: (1) different criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, (2) limitation to ischemic VD in the ADDTC criteria, (3) no further differentiation of VD into subtypes according to CT or MRI findings (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV), and (4) the multifactorial etiopathology of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major diagnostic difficulties ensue from the very frequent cases with white matter lesions, since their etiology and classification remain widely unknown </plain></SENT>
