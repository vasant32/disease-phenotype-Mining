<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found significantly reduced levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in CSF samples from DAT patients compared to VD and control subjects, but CSF levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were found to be significantly elevated in the two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CSF concentrations of tyrosine, leucine and phenylalanine were significantly increased in VD patients in comparison with those in DAT patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a wide increase in CSF/serum amino acid ratios in DAT and VD groups compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were found in CSF/serum ratios between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
