<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We detected an antibody to a 48 kd antigen of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in the serum from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patient with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify and characterize the antigen, we screened a human cerebral cDNA library and performed immunoblot analysis following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D blotting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequences of the isolated cDNA fragments were homologous to human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-D blotting using patient serum revealed that the antibody reacted with a restricted subset of GFAP molecules which exhibited relatively high isoelectric points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to elucidate the importance of the anti-GFAP antibody in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we screened for the presence of an anti-GFAP antibody in the sera of 46 demented patients: 26 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 20 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found an anti-GFAP antibody in the serum of only one patient with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-D blotting revealed that the anti-GFAP antibody in the serum from the VD patient reacted with a more acidic subset of GFAP molecules compared with the anti-GFAP antibody from our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with the fact that the GFAP molecule with high isoelectric point was insoluble and less degraded, these results suggested that the anti-GFAP antibody in the serum of our patient was not generated due to a secondary response to soluble and degraded GFAP which leaked through the damaged blood-brain barrier as found in the VD patient, but was generated actively on the basis of dysregulation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible effects of the autoantibody on astrocytic function and the pathogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
