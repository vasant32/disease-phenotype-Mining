<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> account for over 90% of the most prevalent forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both genetic and environmental factors are determinant for the phenotypic expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD is a complex disorder in which many different gene clusters may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most genes screened to date belong to different proteomic and metabolomic pathways potentially affecting AD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Îµ4 variant of the APOE gene seems to be a major risk factor for both degenerative and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metabolic factors, cerebrovascular disorders, and epigenetic phenomena also contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five categories of genes are mainly involved in pharmacogenomics: genes associated with disease pathogenesis, genes associated with the mechanism of action of a particular drug, genes associated with phase I and phase II metabolic reactions, genes associated with transporters, and pleiotropic genes and/or genes associated with concomitant pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The APOE and CYP2D6 genes have been extensively studied in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic response to conventional drugs in patients with AD is genotype specific, with CYP2D6-PMs, CYP2D6-UMs, and APOE-4/4 carriers acting as the worst responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>APOE and CYP2D6 may cooperate, as pleiotropic genes, in the metabolism of drugs and hepatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The introduction of pharmacogenetic procedures into AD pharmacological treatment may help to optimize therapeutics </plain></SENT>
