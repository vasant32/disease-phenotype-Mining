<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated 27 non-elderly adults with aPAs but without concurrent disease processes or history of neurologic event and 27 age- and education-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MANOVA (p &lt;.01) indicated group differences in executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, and visuospatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, gross attentional processes and fine motor skills appeared unaffected by the &lt;?Pub Caret&gt;syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of impaired neuropsychologic performance was greater among individuals with aPAs than among controls (p &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in otherwise asymptomatic patients with aPAs indicates a preclinical phase of neurologic involvement and may prove to be the most sensitive markers of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
