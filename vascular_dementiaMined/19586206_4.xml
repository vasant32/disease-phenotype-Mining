<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cognitive assessments play an important role in aiding diagnosis, despite a lack of clear evidence defining the cognitive abilities and tests that best distinguish between the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study therefore completed a meta-analysis of research comparing the cognitive abilities of persons diagnosed with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive search was undertaken of the PubMed and PsychInfo databases, with 81 studies being eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weighted Cohen's d effect sizes, percentage overlap statistics, fail-safe Ns, and confidence intervals were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the tests that were examined by more than one study, there was one test of perception and one test of verbal memory that showed large and significant group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were an additional 12 tests that may prove useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive tests were limited in their ability to discriminate between AD and VaD, suggesting that they should be used cautiously and only in conjunction with other information (imaging, medical history) when diagnosing patients </plain></SENT>
