<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sonographic measures, magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) scans and ERPs were recorded in 30 participants treated for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, with no report of neurological or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a sonographic measure of cerebral microcirculation, the arteriorvenous cerebral transit time (cTT) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While neuropsychological measures of memory functions and general mental ability functions did not show systematic correlations with the cTT and other measures of vascular pathology, a pronounced correlation was obtained between P3a latency and cTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with long cTT showed a delayed P3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the P3a is a sensitive measure for reduced cognitive functions even at early stages of cerebrovascular pathology and by this may be a valuable tool for the early identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in individuals being at risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
