<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the outcome of care in terms of time of GL care, survival and care load for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients when extended home care no longer is considered sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients, mean age 83 years, suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and previously institutionalized, were relocated from long-term care wards into GL units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared to a matched sample of patients remaining in traditional institutional (TI) care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference in survival was observed between the two groups after three years, nor between length of stay in GL for the different diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in patients in GL, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and functional decline were less prominent than in TI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was most marked after six months when some improvements in the GL group were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more positive outcome in GL patients <z:chebi fb="72" ids="38954">abates</z:chebi> with time due to the natural course of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After three years, the two patient groups showed a similar pattern of global deterioration with a tendency toward less care load in the GL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Offering GL care as an alternative to TI might raise the quality of life in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly for a period of 2-2.5 years </plain></SENT>
