<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An influential model of how subcortical cerebrovascular disease causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> posits that damage to frontostriatal loops impairs frontal lobe function, leading to predominant impairment of executive function and secondary impairments of associated cognitive functions such as memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, neuropsychological studies of clinically diagnosed patients have reported that individuals with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> do better on memory tests and worse on executive function tests compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation has led to the suggestion that predominant cognitive executive dysfunction might serve as a useful diagnostic marker for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to test this idea in a series of cases with autopsy-defined pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 62 autopsied cases from a prospective study of vascular contributions to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using neuropathological features alone, 23 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 11 with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), 9 with both (mixed pathology) and 19 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly brain (NEB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three psychometrically matched composite scales of different cognitive abilities were used: Verbal Memory, Nonverbal Memory and Executive Function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of group data showed that for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> memory scores were lower than Executive Function by nearly a standard deviation on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, and contrary to the model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was rather equally impaired on Executive Function, Verbal Memory and Nonverbal Memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individual patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were examined by defining three profiles based on reliable differences between neuropsychological scores to characterize cases with predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, predominant executive dysfunction, and 'other' patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of individual impairment profiles showed that predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was present in 71% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> while predominant executive dysfunction described only 45% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A stronger pattern emerged when cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cases were excluded; among the six cognitively impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients four had predominant executive dysfunction and none had predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This report, comprised of a substantial sample of autopsy confirmed cases, delineates the patterns of neuropsychological impairment associated with small vessel cerebrovascular disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> While the findings show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> usually exceeds executive dysfunction in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, the reverse is not the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taken as a whole, the results indicate that the cognitive effects of the small vessel cerebrovascular disease are variable and not especially distinct, thus raising question about the utility of executive impairment as a diagnostic marker for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
