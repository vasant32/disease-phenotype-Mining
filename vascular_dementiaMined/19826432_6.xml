<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> rat model to show that the regeneration of white matter damaged by hypoperfusion is enhanced by inhibiting phosphodiesterase III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> was prepared by bilateral common carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Performance at the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> task, immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine, as well as serial neuronal and glial markers were analyzed until 28 days after hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the number of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the brains of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as well as in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oligodendrocyte progenitor cells subsequently underwent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the number of oligodendrocytes decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rat model, treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase III inhibitor</z:chebi> prevented cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, markedly increased the mature oligodendrocytes, and promoted restoration of white matter and recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were cancelled by using protein kinase A/C inhibitor in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase III inhibitor</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our study indicate that the mammalian brain white matter tissue has the capacity to regenerate after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
