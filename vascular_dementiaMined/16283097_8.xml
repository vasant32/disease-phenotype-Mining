<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>,but the issue whether this concerns only vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical diagnoses and abnormalities on brain MRI in patients with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received standardised, detailed diagnostic studies at a memory clinic, in order to establish whether one specific type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or specific MRI abnormalities were more common in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who visited our memory clinic between January 2002 and June 2004 were divided into a group with (n = 42) or without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 389) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were recorded, and MRI scans were rated for (sub)<z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, infarctions, and white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (36% versus 28%; OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.5-2.2), adjusted for age and sex), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (5% versus 2%; OR 2.4 (0.5-12.1)), and so called "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (24% versus 17%; 1.3 (0.6-2.9)) was similar in patients with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On MRI lacunar and cortical infarctions were more common and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> more pronounced among diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the severity of white matter changes was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The relative frequency of different diagnoses among diabetic and non-diabetic patients attending a memory clinic was similar, indicating that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> does not predispose to one particular subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The imaging findings support the notion that the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is due to dual pathology, involving both cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
