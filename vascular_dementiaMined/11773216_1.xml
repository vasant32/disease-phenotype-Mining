<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) is an important problem that should be solved in the 21st century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to treatment, a simple and easy diagnostic method using biological markers should be available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a method to attain this goal, we detected and determined tau protein in oral mucosal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Oral epithelium was exfoliated from 34 patients with AD or 29 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 33 young and 34 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot was performed for determining the molecular weight of oral tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tau protein level was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF tau was also measured and compared with oral tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blot analysis using an anti-non-phosphorylated tau-protein antibody showed two bands, one at 65 Kd and the other at 110 Kd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tau-protein level in oral epithelia showed a significant positive correlation with those in the CSF (p &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with AD had significantly higher levels of tau protein than the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the controls (p &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AD patients with a younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the study showed a higher level of the tau protein than the patients with later age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Like other nonneural tissues, oral epithelium contains small tau and big tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The tau protein in oral epithelium reflects the pathological changes, as does the CSF tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individuals who develop AD may have had high levels of the tau protein in oral mucosal epithelium since early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The tau-protein level in oral epithelia could be helpful in diagnosing AD </plain></SENT>
