<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is a common finding in older persons, and might be associated with reduced cognitive performance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo>, and functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although LA is more frequent in persons affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, scant data are available about its clinical consequences in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the association between presence of LA and functional performance in basic activities of daily living in a sample of older persons affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 214 patients; 77 affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (LOAD), and 137 by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional status was assessed using Barthel Index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA was assessed using computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In LOAD patients, LA (OR: 7.87; 1.26-48.94), and MMSE score (OR: 0.83; 0.71-0.98) were associated with the risk of severe disability, independent of age, gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In VD patients, MMSE score (OR: 0.77; 0.64-0.93), and CHD (OR: 7.41; 1.09-50.21), but not LA (OR: 2.07; 0.45-9.45) were associated with a severe functional impairment after multivariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that LA might be associated with a worse functional status in basic activities of daily living in patients affected by LOAD but not VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LA might act synergistically with cognitive and behavioural disturbances to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of disability of these patients </plain></SENT>
