<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene (K469E) has been recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, we evaluated the association between this polymorphism and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) by studying 107 patients affected by probable VD and 115 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the EE genotype was significantly higher in VD patients than controls (P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of the EE genotype significantly increased the risk of VD (odds ratio 3.25, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis that ICAM-1 plays a role in the physiopathology of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders and suggest that genetic polymorphisms of ICAM-1 might be clinically important in the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
