<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to use a modified version of Attention Process Training--II (APT-II; Sohlberg, Johnson, Paule, Raskin, &amp; Mateer, 2001) with an individual with early-stage CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: APT-II, modified to include strategy training, was applied in an A-B, multiple-probe design for an individual who had been diagnosed with early-stage CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included pre-post neuropsychological testing of attention, memory, and executive function; within-treatment probes of visual and auditory attention; and a measure of subjective experience of cognitive functioning in daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The participant demonstrated nominal gains on visual and auditory attention probes but improved performance on several posttreatment measures of processing speed and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participant also reported substantially improved functional outcomes following the intervention protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the potential utility of behavioral intervention for individuals with CADASIL and highlights issues for speech-language pathologists to consider when using structured cognitive training protocols in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that further controlled studies for treating this population are warranted </plain></SENT>
