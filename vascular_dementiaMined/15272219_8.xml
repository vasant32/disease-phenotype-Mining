<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence in Spanish populations is still scarce, and there is a dearth of prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in a population cohort aged 75 and over in a rural area in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective population cohort study over a 5-year period in 8 rural villages in the province of Girona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline study in 1990 identified 200 prevalent cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free cohort included 1,260 persons aged 75 and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was the sample used for the incidence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We rescreened and selectively reexamined this group in 1995 using a two-phase procedure consisting of a screening interview at home using the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and VaD were established using the Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly for surviving participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For deceased participants, we used the Retrospective Collateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Interview to establish a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information was obtained for 91% of the subjects at risk; 122 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years at risk were 23.2 (95% CI = 19.1-27.3) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 10.8 (95% CI = 7.8-13.7) for AD and 9.5 (95% CI = 6.7-12.1) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes showed an age-dependent pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Females had a relative risk of 1.8 (95% CI = 1.0-3.4) to develop AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of deceased cases with manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence in 7.1 cases/1,000 person-years at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incidence rates were similar to those reported by other cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes increased with age, but incidence rates did not increase exponentially in the oldest old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Females were at increased risk for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of information about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> symptoms from relatives of deceased participants was useful in order to avoid underestimation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Underestimation of the incidence rates was more important in those aged 75-84 years </plain></SENT>
