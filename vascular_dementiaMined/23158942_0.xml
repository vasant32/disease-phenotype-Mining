<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is still a lack of medication that demonstrates clinically relevant symptomatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Static blood obstructing the brain is the main Chinese medicine syndrome of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Chinese medicine for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis in patients with mild to moderate VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial, a total of 48 patients with mild to moderate VaD were enrolled between March 2009 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients entered a two-week placebo run-in period followed by a 12-week treatment with Chinese medicine for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis (n=24) or placebo (n=24), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The placebo tablets have the identical taste and appearance as the Chinese medicine tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog); the secondary outcome measures included the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Chinese medicine group showed a slight deterioration of 0.25 points and the placebo group showed a deterioration of 2.35 points from baseline by the ADAS-cog, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ADL and the MMSE showed no significant difference from baseline in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were rare in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Chinese medicine for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis may improve cognition and it is safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
