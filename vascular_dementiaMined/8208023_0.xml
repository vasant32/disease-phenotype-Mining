<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the existence of aprosody in a series of patients with multiinfartion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, quantify the disorder and ascertain the factors to which it is related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with criteria of multiinfarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
