<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is toxic to neurons, but the mechanism for its action remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have identified a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-inducing protein, Abeta-related DIP (AB-DIP), by two-hybrid screening of the human brain cDNA library and confirmed the binding of Abeta with AB-DIP by coimmunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of AB-DIP-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and coexpression of Abeta enhanced the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the 97-kDa AB-DIP was cleaved to a 62-kDa protein (AB-DIP p62) at the caspase cleavage site, LEKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is more important that cotransfection of Abeta with AB-DIP produced the AB-DIP p62 fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated knockdown of AB-DIP protein expression significantly protected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells from Abeta-induced neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AB-DIP may mediate the neurotoxicity of Abeta, and therefore, AB-DIP may be a potential, therapeutic target for AD </plain></SENT>
