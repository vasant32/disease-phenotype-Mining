<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 is known to exist in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A notable increase of plasma endothelin-1 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to measure plasma endothelin-1 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> and explore the relationship between endothelin-1 and this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of endothelin-1 were-examined by radioimmunoassay in 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> and in three groups of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the plasma concentration of endothelin-1 in the internal jugular vein to that in the antecubital vein was calculated as an indicator of endothelin-1 level in cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelin-1 ratio devation was seen more often in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endithelin-1 ratios were significantly negatively correlated with Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale scores is subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities is vasoactive factors may make an important contribution to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of this illness </plain></SENT>
