<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the relationship between blood vessel function and cognition in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 14 elderly individuals with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cardiac surgery, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forearm blood flow was measured before and after brachial artery infusion of 3 vasoactive agents (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi>), and these measures of vessel function were then correlated with neuropsychological performance (total scale score on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between neuropsychological performance and vasodilation in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 agents, with 2 reaching statistical significance (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>: rho=0.78, P=0.001; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi>: rho=0.56, P=0.038) and the third showing a strong trend toward significance (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>: rho=0.49, P=0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between neuropsychological performance and more conventional vascular-related variables were much weaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide preliminary evidence of a relationship between resistance vessel function and neuropsychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With further research, measures of vessel dysfunction may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
