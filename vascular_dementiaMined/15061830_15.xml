<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We did a 2-year follow-up study of elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 2820 participants aged 60 years old and over from six communities of Chongqing agreed to take part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed with MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were classified as never smokers, past smokers, and current smokers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was investigated using proportional hazards regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 121 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were detected, of which 84 (69%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 17 (14%) were vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 21(17%) were other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with never smokers, current smokers had an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (RR = 2.72; 95% CI = 1.63-5.42) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (RR = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.53-3.12) adjusting for age, sex, education, blood pressure, and alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with light smokers, the adjusted risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was significantly increased among smokers with a medium level of exposure (RR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.65-5.52), with an even higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in the heavy smoking group (RR = 3.03; 95% CI = 1.25-4.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that both smoking status and amount is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
