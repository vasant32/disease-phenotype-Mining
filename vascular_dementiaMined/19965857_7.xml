<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the 2-year outcome of subjects diagnosed as having mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and nine subjects diagnosed as having MCI were examined with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and followed up after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 years, 34 subjects (16%) were lost for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those subjects did not differ significantly in terms of MCI subclassification, MMSE score or age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 175 subjects followed up, eight (4.5%) had improved to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, two with amnestic MCI, one from multiple domains MCI, three with single domain MCI and two without any significant impairment at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four subjects (25%) had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 35 were from the multidomain amnestic group and nine from the multidomain non-amnestic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of Alzheimer-typical biomarkers (total-tau and amyloid beta) and multidomain amnestic MCI was the strongest predictor of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and multidomain amnestic MCI preceded mixed and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> alone, or impairment in any one cognitive domain alone, is a rather benign condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impairment in several cognitive domains is associated with a more severe outcome over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, 20% of the subjects who progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, did not show <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> at baseline, which suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> is not always the first symptom of even the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
