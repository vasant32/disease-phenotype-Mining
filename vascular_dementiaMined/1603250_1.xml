<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population (n = 438) underwent a detailed psychiatric assessment using the Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly (CAMDEX) as the second stage of a survey of the physical and mental health of the elderly begun in 1988 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Together with measures of incidence and risk factors, the proposed study aims to assess the effect of the decline in mental function of the elderly, on carers, family and health services and to suggest where improvements in planning and delivery of services might be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of problems arise, particularly relevant for studies of the elderly, due to the frequent follow-ups necessary for incidence studies and these are discussed </plain></SENT>
