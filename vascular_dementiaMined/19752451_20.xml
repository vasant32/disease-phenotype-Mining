<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence indicate that a decrease in the CSF concentration of amyloid beta(42) (Abeta(42)) is a potential biomarker for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, studies on plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels have yielded contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the links between incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations in the prospective, population-based Three-City (3C) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the association between plasma concentrations of truncated Abeta (Abeta(n-40) and Abeta(n-42)) and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a subsequent 4-year follow-up period, 257 individuals presented incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from 8,414 participants, and a subcohort of 1,185 individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was drawn as a control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), Abeta(n-40), and Abeta(n-42) were measured using an xMAP-based assay technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between plasma Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the various Abeta variables analyzed, the Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratios presented the strongest association with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: people with a high Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratio had a lower risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were restricted to individuals diagnosed at 2 years of follow-up and the Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratio was mainly associated with the risk of mixed/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations and Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratios may be useful markers to indicate individuals susceptible to short-term risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
