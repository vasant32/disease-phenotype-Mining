<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the correlates of executive dysfunction in a well-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 256 patients from a consecutive cohort of 486 patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, aged 55-85 years, was subjected to a comprehensive neuropsychological examination 3-4 months after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 188 of them in addition to detailed psychiatric examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basic and complex activities of daily living (ADLs) (bADLs and cADLs) post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria were used for the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether 40.6% (n=104) of the patients had executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with executive dysfunction were older, had lower level of education, were more often dependent, did worse in bADLs and cADLs, had more often <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, had worse cognition as measured by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and were more depressed as measured by the BECK <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale, but not with the more detailed psychiatric evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They had more often <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the anterior circulation and less often in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The independent correlates of executive dysfunction were cADLs (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.03-1.16), each point of worsening in cognition by MMSE (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.42-1.97) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation area (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.18-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant executive dysfunction is frequent after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and is closely connected with cADLs and to overall cognitive status but could be distinguished from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> by detailed neuropsychological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Executive measures may detect patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and disability post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
