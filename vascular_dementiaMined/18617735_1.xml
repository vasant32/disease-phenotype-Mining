<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although many proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have assessed the relative ratios of brain metabolites from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, absolute quantification is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of these 2 methods in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in discriminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) from healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 30 AD patients, 13 BD patients and 26 HC subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-voxel proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectra at short echo times were acquired from 8 volumes of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 80% specificity, the absolute N-acetylaspartate concentration in the hippocampus was the most sensitive measure to discriminate AD from HC, and the absolute N-acetylaspartate concentration in the anterior periventricular and deep white matter to differentiate BD from HC and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relative ratio using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> as a reference had a sensitivity over 80% at 80% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of disparities between the 2 methods was attributed to fluctuations in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that absolute quantification is superior to relative ratio to differentiate AD and BD from HC </plain></SENT>
