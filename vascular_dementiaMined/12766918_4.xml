<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may also be encountered in cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other variants of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate PBS frequency and characteristics for a sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> inpatients, and to determine the strength of the association with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample population consisted of 240 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients admitted to our geropsychiatric ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without PBS were compared in terms of general characteristics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 240 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, PBS was identified in 56 (23.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant gender differences between the PBS and non-PBS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Means for age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-age were higher for the PBS group, and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> and other misidentifications was greater compared to the non-PBS analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of PBS was not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> or physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PBS is a common symptom in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of various etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our association findings suggest that it may be more productive to classify PBS as a type of misidentification, instead of as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011253" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
