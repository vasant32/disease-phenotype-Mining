<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients, 46 in Sdx group, 40 in Ptx group, fulfilling the NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen levels showed a significant reduction in both groups, in patients with high basal levels (&gt; or = 350 mg/dl), the reduction being earlier in Sdx group (2nd month of therapy) than in Ptx group (4th month of therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Sdx group a significant reduction in factor VII-Ag (baseline 102.8 U/dl; 6th month 90.1 U/dl) was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both drugs induced a slight reduction in activated factor VII levels as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A parallel improvement of G.B.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rating Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scores was observed in Sdx group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results seem to indicate that sulodexide treatment can have positive effects in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
