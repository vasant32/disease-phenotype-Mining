<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various mutations in the Notch3 gene cause the disease, whereas the mechanism of how they cause the disorder remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently identified two Japanese CADASIL families with an R141C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 44.6, and the main symptoms were recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and progressive motor disturbances in extremities, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides those in white matter and basal ganglia, ischemic lesions in temporal edge and corpus callosum were present on magnetic resonance images, which seemed to be characteristic of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in our cases, nocturnal arterial blood pressure fall was significantly lower in patients compared with control subjects, suggesting that it might be partly associated with ischemic lesions in deep white matter in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared Japanese and Caucasian CADASIL cases and found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar palsy</z:hpo> were observed more frequently in Japanese patients, although typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> was rather rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe the clinical features of CADASIL, hoping to help reveal the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e>, including leukoaraiosis or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
