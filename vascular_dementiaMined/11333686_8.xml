<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in a population with a low level of education, and to determine whether there is any association between occupation, education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS and METHOD: Cross-section study of the population, with a sample of 3,214 individuals representative of the population of Toledo, Spain, aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used in the first phase of the study to detect those individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second phase consisted of a semi-structured clinical interview and neuropsychological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were determined using well-established diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The process was applied using an algorithm to optimise diagnostic agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> amounted to 7.6, 4.6 and 1.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A direct relationship was detected between these three entities and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was greater in women, illiterate persons and occupations which require less skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once adjustment had been made for other socio-demographic variables, only age was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Alzheimer's type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No clear association was found between education, occupation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
