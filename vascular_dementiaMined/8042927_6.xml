<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the overall effect of Hydergine (a combination drug called ergoloid mesylates) on patients with possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to investigate potential moderators of an effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and two proprietary databases were searched for reports of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Included were randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials in subjects with symptoms consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> performed with specified outcome instruments and sufficient statistical information to calculate effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven (31%) of 151 trials reviewed met selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Potential moderating variables were extracted from each trial: sample size, inpatient-outpatient status, trial duration, age, gender, medication dose, publication year, and diagnostic grouping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were extracted with their associated statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: The overall combined treatment effects ("adjusted d") for three types of outcome measures were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, Hydergine was more effective than placebo as assessed by comprehensive ratings (d = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.56; P = .0001), clinical global ratings (d = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.68; P = .0001), and combined neuropsychological measures (d = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.32; P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inpatient status, daily doses of 4 mg or more, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were generally associated with larger effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect in patients with possible Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was significant only for combined neuropsychological measures in five trials (d = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.44; P = .0001; and with a dose-response, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ergoloid mesylates were more effective than placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the effect in patients with possible Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was very modest at best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dose-response relation suggests that potentially effective doses may be higher than the currently approved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The circumstances of the efficacy of Hydergine remain inadequately defined </plain></SENT>
