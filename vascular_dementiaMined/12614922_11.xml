<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the newly developed INNOTEST Phospho-Tau((181P)) kit examination of total tau and tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (phospho-tau 181) revealed significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher values in both patients with incipient and manifest AD than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, phospho-tau 181 levels were not different from controls but were significantly lower than in patients with manifest AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that total and phosphorylated tau protein may facilitate early detection and differential diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
