<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we report the case of an 86-year-old woman with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> addressed to our service for routinary ECG Holter Monitoring (EHM) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several day-time episodes of fall-asleep while sitting had been previously reported by the nurse and generally attributed to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> itself, without taking into consideration the hypothesis of an <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EHM reading reported several and often subsequent pauses (561), many of them critical, the longest lasting 15,9 s with no changes in clinical condition of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the EHM were reported to the physicians in charge for the patient and subsequently the woman was referred to the arrhythmology unit for pace-maker device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generalizing our experience, we suggest that advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, often associated with episodes of fall-asleep, could mask a conduction disturbance causing critical pauses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>; therefore we suggest screening those patients for possible arrhythmic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we remark that in our patient the pauses weren't associated with a worsening of the patient as seen in the follow-up, and this fact supports the hypothesis that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could increase cerebral ischaemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
