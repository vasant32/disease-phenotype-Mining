<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined whether higher endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels were associated with lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older men and women not using hormonal replacement therapy, using a case-cohort design within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based follow-up study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in 7983 subjects aged 55 years or older, and ongoing since 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analyses were based on a random subcohort of 508 women and 438 men, and on 76 women and 53 men with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models with robustly estimated standard errors showed that in women higher levels of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> were associated with higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (age-adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted HR's of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with higher levels of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (per SD increase) were 1.24 (95% CI 0.87-1.76) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.22-3.92), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for bioavailable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustments for potential confounders did not change the results substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In men, no clear association was observed between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> reduce risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, neither in women nor in men </plain></SENT>
