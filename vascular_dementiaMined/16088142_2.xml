<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now recognized that CBD patients usually present with two phenotypes: the lateralized phenotype and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our work was to determine the nature and the progression of cognitive and behavioural impairment in 10 lateralized CBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our patients, the most salient aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were: an evident alteration of rapid alternating operative strategies, associated with the evident impairment of set shifting, of executive operations, of operative and sequential procedure and of implementation of judgement and abstract reasoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The self-activation of retrieval processes is partly preserved in CBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other types of subcortical impairments, even CBD encompasses both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> as well as a wide range of behaviour disturbances, such as progressive alterations of sleep, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (with a remarkable incidence of somatic pain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in addition to neuropsychological assessment, quantification of the personality <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behaviour disorder</z:e> is important for standardizing the diagnosis of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and distinguishing it from any other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
