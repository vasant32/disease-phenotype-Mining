<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score in differentiating between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, fluctuating course, nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, and focal neurological symptoms emerged as features with the best discriminating value, and helped to diagnose correctly 89% of the Alzheimer and 71% of the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
