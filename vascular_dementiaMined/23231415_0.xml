<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) regulations, typically involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inhibitors tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor- related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRPs) as mediators became interesting since tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-related <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown with risk of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was considered to involve these mediators too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which tPA implements its actions within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) has been the topic of much controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding of plasminogen to surfaces is of crucial importance in regulating the function of this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>tPA can modulate permeability of the neurovascular unit in physiological conditions and pathological events exacerbating injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, traumatic brain injury or neurotoxic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasminogen activating enzyme system is widely appreciated for its role in fibrinolysis and thrombolysis and in other areas related to remodelling of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this enzyme system also has a major impact in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system under pathological circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to revise the last patents and news to understand the mechanism by which t-PA modulates <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
