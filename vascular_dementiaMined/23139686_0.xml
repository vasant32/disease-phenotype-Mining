<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential usefulness of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [14 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 30 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 Parkinson's disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PDD)], 12 subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), and 30 matched controls were examined by the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the WAIS-R Digit Span subtest, and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> consists of 10 complex pictures, each presenting characteristics paradoxically in opposition to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects scored points for naming the object and noticing the paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One point was added for commenting on the paradox without prompting (3 points each picture/maximum of 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> scores were significantly higher in the control group (mean ± SD, 29.46 ± 1.43) than in the AD, VaD, MCI, and PDD groups (13.1 ± 2.3, 16.9 ± 3.5, 23.2 ± 1.4, and 23.6 ± 3.4, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlations between MMSE, Digit Span, CDT, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> scores were observed (rho 0.76, 0.35, and 0.56, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show perception of complex pictures being compromised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> scores and MMSE scores suggests that tests may be used as a brief screening tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
