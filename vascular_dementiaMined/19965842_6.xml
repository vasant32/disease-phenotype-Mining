<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2097 participants from a sample of 5632 subjects (65-84 years old) from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Ageing were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined according to the Third Adults Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were classified using current published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MetS subjects (N=918) compared with those without MetS (N=1179) had an increased risk for VaD (1.63% vs 0.85%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 3.71, 95% CI 1.40 to 9.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding 338 subjects with baseline undernutrition, MetS subjects compared with those without MetS had an elevated risk of VaD (adjusted HR, 3.82; 95% CI 1.32 to 11.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, those with MetS and high <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> had a still further higher risk of VaD (multivariate adjusted HR, 9.55; 95% CI 1.17 to 78.17) compared with those without MetS and high <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, those with MetS and low <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> compared with those without MetS and low <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> did not exhibit a significant increased risk of VaD (adjusted HR, 3.31, 95% CI 0.91 to 12.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, a synergistic MetS effect versus its individual component effects was verified on the risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our population, MetS subjects had an elevated risk of VaD that increased after excluding patients with baseline undernutrition and selecting MetS subjects with high <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
