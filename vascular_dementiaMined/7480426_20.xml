<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Principal components analysis and latent trait analysis were used to develop a set of scales to summarize these clinical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are three scales derived from an interview with the subject (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>) and three from an interview with an informant (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive Decline</z:hpo>, Behaviour Change, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results are reported on the reliability and validity of these scales using data from clinical samples in Sydney and Geneva and a population sample from Canberra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scales were found to have excellent validity when judged against clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and could distinguish Alzheimer's from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cut-off points were developed to indicate correspondence between scale scores and clinical diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentile rank norms were developed from the Canberra population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> is easy to administer and score and can be used by lay interviewers after training </plain></SENT>
