<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were subdivided into individuals with only white matter involvement (WM) and individuals with evidence of a cortical infarction in addition to white matter ischemic change (C+WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results revealed that both groups of subjects were impaired across cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was more severely impaired among the C+WM group, but the general pattern of deficits did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hachinski scores were significantly higher and instrumental activities of daily living were more severely affected in the C+WM group compared to the WM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were evident between the two groups on overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity or the extent of white matter involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that cognitive function in VaD may be globally impaired, and that cortical infarction in addition to white matter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> results in greater impairment, but the differences are largely quantitative rather than qualitative </plain></SENT>
