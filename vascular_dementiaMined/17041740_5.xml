<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological and blood-flow studies indicate distinct patterns of deterioration of anterior and posterior cortical function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We predict that the FAB score may be useful for discriminating VD from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of the FAB test for differential diagnosis of AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared FAB scores in 25 patients with AD, 27 patients with VD, and 80 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AD group was matched for age, education and MMSE score with the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subtest scores in FAB were also compared among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FAB scores were significantly decreased in both the AD and VD groups compared to the control group, and the reduction were greater in the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the FAB subtests, mental flexibility (phonological verbal fluency) was the only subtest that significantly discriminated VD from the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FAB test can provide useful information for differentiating AD and VD at the bedside </plain></SENT>
