<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship(s) between neuroradiological evidence of subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and neuropsychological impairments has not been specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define these research criteria, the authors rated the severity of MRI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> (WMAs) and neuropsychological data from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine outpatients who met the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were studied with neuropsychological tests that assessed executive (mental) control, declarative memory, visuoconstruction (clock drawing), and language (semantic category fluency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI-WMAs were rated using a leukoaraiosis (LA) scale (range 0 to 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, regression analyses demonstrated that neuropsychological measures accounted for 60.7% of the variance in WMA severity (47.3% of this variance attributable to executive/visuoconstructive test performance, 13.4% attributable to memory/language test performance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, patients were grouped according to the severity of WMAs (i.e., low, moderate, and severe white matter groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only patients with mild WMA (mean LA = 3.61 +/- 2.63, approximately 2.4 to 15.6% of the subcortical white matter) presented with greater impairment on memory/language tests vs executive control/visuoconstructive tests, a neuropsychological profile typically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate WMA (mean LA = 12.76 +/- 2.49, approximately 25.6 to 38.1% of the subcortical white matter) presented with equal impairment on executive/visuoconstructional vs memory/language tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe WMA (mean LA = 21.76 +/- 2.97, approximately 46.9 to 62.4% of the subcortical white matter) displayed a profile of greater executive/visuoconstructional impairment relative to memory/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023015" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">language disabilities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A profile of equal impairment on tests of executive control and memory along with radiologic evidence involving about one-fourth of the cerebral white matter as measured by the Leukoaraiosis Scale may be sufficient for a diagnosis of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
