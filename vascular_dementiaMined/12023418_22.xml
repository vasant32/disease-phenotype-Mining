<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) is characterised by functional impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, especially pyramidal neurones of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have been shown to have similar metabolic and volumetric deficits to those with AD, the underlying pathogenesis of these changes is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pyramidal cell loss occurs in small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by quantifying hippocampal volume and CA1 neurone number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty four prospectively studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were screened, and four patients fulfilling criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> with no other significant neuropathological abnormality were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were compared with five patients fulfilling criteria for AD and seven controls matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal formation was serially sectioned, and the number of CA1 pyramidal neurones estimated using the optical dissector technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance was used to evaluate group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in both the AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> groups showed a substantial loss of pyramidal neurones from the CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the degree of CA1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> were similar in the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support recent in vivo studies showing similar metabolic deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in AD and subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, they provide evidence that the underlying cause of these abnormalities is a similar loss of neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whereas the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in AD is related to the deposition of abnormal proteins, the cause in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the absence of other pathologies, damage to cerebral microvasculature should be considered a likely candidate </plain></SENT>
