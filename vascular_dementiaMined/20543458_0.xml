<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) demonstrate difficulties in doing two things at once or 'dual-tasking' and that this dual task impairment is insensitive to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or prodromal conditions like Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, if this impairment is specific to AD, or also present in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study 15 people with VaD, 25 healthy age-matched and 25 healthy young controls were assessed using a paper and pencil dual tasking paradigm and several measures of working and episodic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age had no effect on dual task performance, but the VaD patients demonstrated a significant impairment in dual tasking ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance on the memory measures was instead affected by age with a further deterioration in the VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both dual tasking and memory ability were significantly correlated with disease severity, as assessed by the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that performance on the dual task could be a specific indicator of pathological ageing </plain></SENT>
