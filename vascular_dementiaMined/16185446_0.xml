<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the predictive factors on mortality and survival of elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were from people who had been screened in a prevalence survey study from the selected 5 urban and 4 rural communities from 1997 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase I screening was carried out by a brief memory testing with mini-mental state examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phase II, those who scored below the cutoff points and 4% of those whose score was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range were interviewed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> through a set of diagnostic examinations according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IV criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In phase III which was six months later, a follow-up program was conducted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons who were involved in phase II to identify those with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) according to NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDA-AIREN criteria and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality of elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 6.06/1000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to nondementia group, the survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group had a decrease of 57% after 40 months of follow-up (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between AD and VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and VaD were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.42-1.86), 1.71 (95% CI: 1.44-2.03) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.16-1.82), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some factors such as age (RR = 1.0685), severalty (RR = 1.5733), and high ADL (RR = 1.0368) might have increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mortality of elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Shanghai was lower than that seen in other areas in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious difference between the survival rates of AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age, severalty and high ADL seemed to be the risk factors to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
