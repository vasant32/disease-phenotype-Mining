<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of these changes in a younger population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is not currently known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the potential of high signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High signal abnormalities were rated, using a previously validated scale, from hard copies of T2 weighted axial images of 102 patients with AD (n=49), VaD (n=31), FTD (n=22) (mean ages 63-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High signal abnormalities were widespread across AD, VaD and FTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although they were most frequent and most severe in the VaD group only lacunes and grade III deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were specific for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High signal changes on T2 weighted images on MRI are common across degenerative (AD and FTD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although lacunes and grade III DWMH are specific for VaD, the low sensitivities (sensitivities: for lacunes, 0.32; for grade III DWMH, 0.16) limit their use as diagnostic markers for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High signal changes on MRI should be interpreted with caution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their presence, even in younger patients, should not deter one from diagnosing AD or FTD </plain></SENT>
