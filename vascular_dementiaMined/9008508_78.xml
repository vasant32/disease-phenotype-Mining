<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the very old, and to explore the relation with age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free cohort was followed for an average of three years in Stockholm, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up, the subjects were interviewed by nurses, clinically examined by physicians, and cognitively assessed by psychologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deceased cohort members were studied using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, hospital clinical records, and discharge diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses were made according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria independently by two physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consisted of 1,473 subjects (75+ years old), of which 987 were clinically examined at follow-up, 314 died before the examination, and 172 refused to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 148 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the age-group 75 to 79, the incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 19.6 for women and 12.4 for men per 1,000 person-years, whereas for 90+ year-old subjects the corresponding figures were 86.7 and 15.0 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of distribution by age and gender was seen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each age stratum, the incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were higher for women than for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted odds ratio for women was 1.9 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 3.1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increases with age, even in the oldest age groups; (2) women have a higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than men, especially at very old ages; (3) this pattern is mainly due to the age and gender distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, rather than vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
