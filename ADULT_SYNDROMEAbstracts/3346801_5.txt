The early affective, apparently temperamental antecedents of Type A behavior were investigated in a Swedish longitudinal sample (N = 149). Four clusters of Type A items (describing irritability, hurried behavior, work achievement, and competitiveness) were regressed on maternal ratings of the child's poor appetite, sleep disturbances, liveliness, anger, and shyness, collected annually from infancy to adolescence. The child's liveliness, sociability, and poor appetite during infancy and childhood were positively related to the adult Type A irritability and hurried behavior clusters, as were the mother's liveliness, orderliness, and intelligence as rated by psychologists during the child's first 6 years. The two work-involvement clusters were predicted by interactive effects among shyness, poor appetite, and anger during adolescence but were unrelated to mother attributes. Sleep disturbances were only related to competitiveness and only in late adolescence. These findings indicate that the interrelated components of adult Type A behavior have contrasting developmental histories and that temperament-related constructs are important antecedents to the adult syndrome.
