Uteroplacental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and subsequent low birth weight, which predisposes the affected newborn towards adult Syndrome X. Individuals with Syndrome X suffer increased morbidity from adult ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia initiates a defensive increase in cardiac glucose metabolism, and individuals with Syndrome X demonstrate reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced glucose uptake. Glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 facilitate glucose uptake across cardiac plasma membranes, and hexokinase II (HKII) is the predominant hexokinase isoform in adult cardiac tissue. We therefore hypothesized that GLUT1, GLUT4 and HKII gene expression would be reduced in heart muscle of growth-retarded rats, and that reduced gene expression would result in reduced myocardial glucose uptake. To prove this hypothesis, we measured cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein in control IUGR rat hearts at day 21 and at day 120 of life. HKII mRNA quantification and 2-deoxyglucose-uptake studies were performed in day-120 control and IUGR cardiac muscle. Both GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced at day 21 and at day 120 of life in IUGR hearts. HKII mRNA was also reduced at day 120. Similarly, both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced in day-120 IUGR cardiac muscle. We conclude that adult rats showing IUGR as a result of uteroplacental insufficiency express significantly less cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein than control animals (which underwent sham operations), and that this decrease in gene expression occurs in parallel with reduced myocardial glucose uptake. We speculate that this reduced GLUT gene expression and glucose uptake contribute towards mortality from ischemic heart disease seen in adults born with IUGR.
