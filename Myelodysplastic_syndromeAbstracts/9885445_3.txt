A case of successful pregnancy in a 47-year-old Omani grand-multipara who had Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is described for the first time in Oman. A review of the literature suggests that in Japan the problem may be more common than elsewhere. The unusual features in the case reported here include, improvement in haematological parameters during the pregnancy contrary to expectation, and in addition, the religious and cultural factors that intruded into the clinical decision making process. Suggestions to combat the latter factors are made.
