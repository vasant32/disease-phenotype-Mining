We measured the concentration of CD33 antigen on the surface of cells in 315 bone marrow (BM) samples and 114 corresponding peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients with various leukemias (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], myeloproliferative disorder [MPD] other than CML, myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) and from control subjects. Overall CD33 intensity in total CD33+ cells was significantly higher in BM than in PB. CD33 intensity in total BM CD33+ cells differed significantly with the type of disease. The median number of CD33 molecules per cell was highest in AML, followed by MDS, CML, and control subjects and lowest in MPD. When only CD34+/CD33+ cells were examined, CD33 molecules per cell were highest in CD34+ cells in AML and lowest in MPD (P = .027). Patients with AML or MDS younger than 60 years had significantly higher intensity of CD33 expression on CD34+ cells than patients 60 years or older. Levels of CD33 intensity did not correlate with cytogenetics in patients with AML or MDS. There was no correlation between CD33 intensity and response to therapy or overall survival in 35 patients treated with protocols including Mylotarg. These data demonstrate variation in CD33 intensity between various leukemias.
