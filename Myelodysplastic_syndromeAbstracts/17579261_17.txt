Tumor-specific immunotherapy with a Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) peptide has been on clinical trial for leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, breast and lung cancers and is producing promising results. In this study, we treated three patients with renal cell carcinoma with an anchor modified, HLA-A*2402 binding WT1 peptide which was emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. In two patients tumor growth was suppressed and clinical response was evaluated as stable disease by the RECIST criteria after 3 months of weekly immunizations. Notably, development of new metastases has stopped in these patients for a prolonged period. No deleterious side effects were observed. Peptide-specific T cells were expanded in PBMCs of the patients and a substantial fraction of them bore the surface phenotype consistent with a CD8+ cytotoxic effector population. Although established tumors did not regress further, considering the component of the vaccine, i.e. peptide alone, the stabilization effect suggested the potential of WT1 peptide to develop into a more effective vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of WT1 immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma. Hopefully, the results will stimulate more extensive clinical studies.
