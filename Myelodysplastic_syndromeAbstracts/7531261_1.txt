We evaluated the effects of 2 months of G-CSF treatment on in vitro hematopoiesis in 17 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although in vitro marrow myeloid progenitor cell (CFU-GM) growth stimulated by G-CSF generally remained subnormal, in the majority of neutrophil responders significantly augmented incremental change (termed AIC) of CFU-GM numbers occurred after treatment, as did neutrophilic differentiation. The neutrophil non-responders had less prominent in vitro myeloid responses and lower basal neutrophil levels (p < 0.05). Following G-CSF treatment, the initially subnormal erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) values underwent AIC in five of 11 patients along with increased reticulocyte responses in vivo, whereas four of the five patients who lacked AIC of BFU-E did not. Three patients with persisting cytogenetic abnormalities and increased neutrophilic differentiation in vitro also responded in vivo, suggesting that G-CSF induced in vivo cellular differentiation from the abnormal clone. Two of the three patients who developed blastic responses in vivo had increased CFU-GM growth pre- and post-therapy. These results indicate in vivo-in vitro correlations for myeloid and erythroid responses of MDS marrow cells which related to treatment with G-CSF.
