We treated a patient with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (Epo). The patient achieved a hematological remission which continued for more than 16 months despite discontinuation of the treatment. Before the treatment with GM-CSF and Epo the patient had severe pancytopenia, required frequent red cell transfusions, and experienced episodes of severe infection, but after the therapy he no longer needed transfusion and no longer had the infection. While the patient remained in hematological remission, bone marrow examination revealed trilineage dysplasia, and cytogenetic analysis showed an abnormal karyotype [48, XY, +8, +der(1q5p)] in 100% of the metaphases examined. These findings suggest that the hematological remission of this patient may not result from the recovery of the non-clonal hematopoiesis of a normal clone, but result from the monoclonal hematopoiesis of a neoplastic clone.
