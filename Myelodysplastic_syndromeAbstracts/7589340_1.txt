Thirty-four patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, 23 men and 11 women, aged between 47 and 80 years, with all types of myelodysplastic syndromes were treated with 13-cis-retinoic acid. The dose of retinoic acid ranged between 10 and 60 mg/m2/daily and was administered in combination with vitamin E to diminish side effects. The duration of treatment was 3 months to 5 years. Partial remission was achieved in 4 patients, 1 with RA type, 2 with RAEB and 1 with CMML. Survival ranged from 1 to 5 years. Patients who received retinoic acid developed mild side effects. In conclusion, the administration of 13-cis-retinoic acid improves the hematological picture in a small number of MDS patients (11.7%).
