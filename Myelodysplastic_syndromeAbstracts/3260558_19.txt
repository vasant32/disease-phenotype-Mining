Bone marrow cells from patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, cancer, and other disorders on a phase I clinical trial with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) were assessed in vitro for numbers of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells, and for growth patterns (colony-to-cluster ratio) of CFU-GM, cycling rates of CFU-GM, and responsiveness in vitro to colony-stimulating and colony-inhibiting factors. The colony-to-cluster ratio of CFU-GM and the dose-response curves of CFU-GM to stimulation by rhGM-CSF in vitro did not change during the clinical trial. However, the percentage of CFU-GM in DNA synthesis, which is a measure of the proliferative rates of these cells, determined by the high specific activity tritiated thymidine kill technique in vitro, was markedly enhanced in a reversible fashion after administration in vivo of rhGM-CSF. The increased cycling rates of CFU-GM were consistent with the induced increase in neutrophil counts in these patients that has been reported elsewhere. Additionally, marrow CFU-GM from patients given rhGM-CSF in vivo were increased in sensitivity to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human H-subunit (acidic) ferritin in two of eight cases, and were increased in sensitivity to inhibition by lower dosages of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha in all patients evaluated. The sensitivity of CFU-GM to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human interferon gamma and prostaglandin E1 did not change during the clinical trial. These studies demonstrate that the rhGM-CSF is having an effect on CFU-GM in the patients on the phase I clinical trial. This information may be of significance in planning future clinical studies combining rhGM-CSF with chemotherapy and/or other biotherapy.
