Thrombopoietin (TPO) serum levels were quantified in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes using an ELISA test for TPO. We found that TPO levels were significantly elevated in the whole group of patients as compared with normal healthy donors (521.9 75.3 pg/ml vs 160.1 19.6 pg/ml; P = 0.011). TPO serum levels were inversely correlated with the megakaryocyte mass in both the RA/RARS and RAEB/RAEBt subgroups ( P = 0.012 and P = 0.031, respectively). Two subsets of patients with a possible dysregulation of TPO production were identified.
