Two acromegalic patients with severe headache were treated with the somatostatin analogue, octreotide (Sandostatin). A double-blind study of octreotide versus placebo in which pain intensity was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed initially with these patients. A rapid (within 4-15 min) pain relief occurred lasting 2-8.5 h after injection of 100 micrograms of octreotide, an effect that was not reversed by intravenous (i.v.) naloxone. These 2 acromegalic patients then received treatment for 71 and 82 months, respectively, with doses starting at 500 micrograms/day and 1500 micrograms/day, respectively, without evidence of either tolerance or dependence, although the effect of octreotide on headache appears to be selective. No unwanted sedative effect has been observed. A screening procedure with injection of 50 micrograms of subcutaneous (s.c.) octreotide was performed in 11 other patients with chronic severe pain associated with various conditions. Only 3 patients (2 with diabetic polyneuropathy and 1 with bone pain associated with myelodysplastic syndrome) reported more than 50% pain relief. In the insulin-dependent diabetic patients the double-blind check was not performed due to the risk of octreotide-induced hypoglycemia. In the patient with bone pain the same double-blind check as in the acromegalic patients could not confirm the analgesic effect. It may thus be concluded that octreotide appears to be useful for the treatment of both chronic and acute severe painful conditions in acromegalic patients. However, since its analgesic effect in our patients was confined to headaches only, further controlled studies must be carried out in order to determine appropriate target groups.
