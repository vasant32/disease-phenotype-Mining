We conducted a phase II study of the intravenous administration of a glycosylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) for 7-14 d in 41 patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Administration of rhG-CSF elicited striking rises in both leucocyte and neutrophil counts in the majority of the patients irrespective of the FAB subtypes of MDS. The rises in neutrophil counts were dose dependent and 5 micrograms/kg/d of rhG-CSF yielded approximately an 8-fold increase in neutrophil counts. Leucocytes and neutrophil counts started to increase shortly after the first injection of 5 micrograms/kg, was maintained at significantly elevated levels during 14 d of treatment, and returned to the pretreatment levels within several days following discontinuation of rhG-CSF. The action of rhG-CSF was specific for neutrophils since leucocytosis was due exclusively to neutrophilic increase associated with an increased marrow myeloid maturation. There were no consistent changes in the monocyte, eosinophil, lymphocyte, platelet or reticulocyte counts. After treatment, the percentage of marrow blast cells was reduced in eight of 13 evaluable patients with refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t). No patients developed acute leukaemia during the treatment or in the immediate follow-up period. The treatment was well tolerated with only minimal toxicity. The results suggest that rhG-CSF is a safe and effective way to promptly improve neutropenia in MDS patients.
