An allogeneic transplantation of CD34(+)-selected cells from peripheral blood (allo-PBT/CD34(+)) from HLA-identical sibling donors was performed in 50 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission (AML CR1) (n = 29), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 4), or chronic myeloid leukemia in first chronic phase (CML CP1) (n = 17). Clinical results were compared to a concurrent group of 50 patients transplanted with unmodified peripheral blood progenitor cells (allo-PBT), matched for age, diagnosis, and disease stage. The median follow-up period was 29 months (range 1-69). The actuarial probability of developing acute GVHD clinical grade II to IV was 16% (95%CI: 6-26) for the allo-PBT/CD34(+) group and 41% (95%CI: 29-57) for the allo-PBT group (P = 0.002). The actuarial probability of developing extensive chronic GVHD was 22% (95%CI: 8-36) for the allo-PBT/CD34(+) group and 47% (95%CI: 31-63) for the allo-PBT group (P = 0.02). Recipients of allo-PBT/CD34(+) had less toxicity associated with the transplant and better Karnofsky index at the last follow-up. For AML/MDS patients, the actuarial probability of disease-free survival (DFS) for recipients of allo-PBT/CD34(+) and allo-PBT was 65% (95%CI: 45-85) vs43% (95%CI: 28-58) (P = 0.05), respectively. These data provide a rationale for a randomised trial of allo-PBT/CD34(+) vs allo-PBT in AML/MDS patients in early stage of the disease.
