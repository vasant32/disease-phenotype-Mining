A delay in red cell recovery after ABO-incompatible bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is often observed. The authors experienced a case of prolonged anemia after a major ABO incompatible BMT for myelodysplastic syndrome which was successfully treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo). Effects of Epo were confirmed by the recurrence of anemia after withdrawal of Epo as well as the rapid reincrease in reticulocytes on readministration. The patient received a dose of Epo which was similar to the amount used for renal anemia, however serum concentration of Epo after administration exceeded endogenous Epo levels. Epo may have a beneficial role in the treatment of prolonged anemia after BMT.
