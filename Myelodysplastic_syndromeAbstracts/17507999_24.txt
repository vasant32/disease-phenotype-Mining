Immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to induce sustained hematological responses in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In particular, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of MDS patients. We report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of ATG in the treatment of 96 patients with MDS. Patients were evaluated for duration of response to ATG, as well as survival after administration of ATG. The median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19-75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8-133 months). A total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6-92 months). On multivariate analysis, both low International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and bone marrow (BM) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to ATG (IPSS Int-2/high: odds ratio (OR) 0.08, P=0.018 and BM normo/hypercellularity: OR 0.49, P=0.012). In addition, IPSS was the sole predictor of overall survival, with Int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (OR 0.08, P<0.01). In conclusion, this study identifies BM hypocellularity and a low IPSS as important factors predicting response to ATG.
