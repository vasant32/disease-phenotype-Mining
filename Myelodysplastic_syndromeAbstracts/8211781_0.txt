Refractory anemia (RA) and RA with blast excess (RABE) showed inhibited proliferation of bone marrow erythroid cells (EC), the lowest values being in RABE. The latter, however, was accompanied with the highest count of PAS-positive EC, uneffective erythropoiesis being present in both RA and RABE. In sideroblast anemia the above proliferation was also inhibited, but uneffective erythropoiesis played much more pronounced role in pathogenesis of this anemia than in RA and RABE. The percentage of PAS-positive EC averaged 39.0%. The findings contribute to more profound understanding of anemia arising in myelodysplasia syndrome, to more accurate evaluation of therapeutic effect and prognosis in the above disease.
