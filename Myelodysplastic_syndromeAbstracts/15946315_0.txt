An unusual case of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with indolent clinical course is described. The patient, a 67-yr-old female, had first been diagnosed to suffer from low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, subtype refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, in 1992. In 2001, transformation to secondary AML with an increase in bone marrow blasts (>20%) and thrombocytopenia, was found. The patient did not require cytoreductive drugs. Rather, during the following months, spontaneous improvement of peripheral blood cells with normalization of platelets and decrease in the red cell transfusion frequency, were noted. In October 2002, she even became transfusion independent. However, the bone marrow still showed AML with >20% blasts. These blast cells exhibited a monoclonal pattern in the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay. However, no chromosomal defects occurred during a total observation period of 14 yr. We hypothesize that clonal stability may have contributed to the indolent course of the disease in this patient. The exact mechanisms underlying clinical and genetic stability remain unknown, however.
