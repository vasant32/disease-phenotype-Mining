A 71-year-old man was given a diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in May 1995. However, immunosuppressive agents, including prednisolone, azathioprine, and cyclosporin A, were not effective, and he required frequent red cell transfusions. In September 1995, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis developed (peaking at 10,100/microliter white cells and 98.1 x 10(4)/microliter platelets, respectively, in November 1996). Conversely, the patient's peripheral blood count began to decrease in July 1996, and pancytopenia progressed thereafter i(17) (q10) chromosomal abnormality of bone marrow cells was detected in November 1996. The patient was readmitted due to the progression of thrombocytopenia (1.2 x 10(4)/microliter). His bone marrow has 16.6% blasts, and a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was made. The patient died in November 1997. His hematological state demonstrated significant changes in a relatively short period and severe hypoerythropoiesis and eosinophilia of the bone marrow persisted throughout the clinical course. These findings suggested that a common deranged stem cell was the origin of 3 different states; PRCA, chromic myeloproliferative disorder, and MDS. The i(17) (q10) anomaly may have caused the acute proliferation of blasts and pancytopenia.
