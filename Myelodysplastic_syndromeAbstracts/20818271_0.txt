A 9-year-old girl with intractable anemia, rare mucocutaneous bleeding, and pallor was presented. Hemoglobin was 49 g/L; reticulocyte 0.79%, mean corpuscular volume 81 fL, platelet 37×10⁹/L; white blood cell count 3.2×10⁹/L with dysmorphic cells in peripheric blood. Further evaluation revealed 10% cellularity with grade IV reticulin fibrosis, immature, and/or dysplastic hematopoietic cells without sideroblasts, or blast increase in biopsy, Monosomy 8 was found in bone marrow aspiration material using FISH.
