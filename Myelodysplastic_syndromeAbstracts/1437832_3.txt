Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections of 169 bone marrow biopsies fixed in a buffered methanol-formalin solution and decalcified with EDTA. The biopsies included specimens with normal hematopoiesis, and specimens that were affected by various hematological disorders as well as some metastatic carcinomas. The results demonstrate that a wide spectrum of antigens was preserved in routinely processed bone marrow biopsies, even after long-term fixation up to 12 days. Markers for granulopoietic cells were lysozyme, elastase, DAKO-M 1, and MT 1. Megakaryopoiesis was stained with glycoprotein IIIa, von Willebrand factor, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA), and erythropoiesis with LN 1. Normal lymphocytes as well as lymphoma cells of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tested were positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and at variable degree, for MB 1, 4 KB 5, LN 1, LN 2, UCHL 1, or MT 1. Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin's cells in Hodgkin's lymphomas were reactive with Ber-H 2, LN 2 and Dako-M 1. In plasma cell disorders, staining for immunoglobulin light chains gave best results. Metastatic carcinomas showed predominantly staining with EMA, and KL 1. A selected panel of specific cell markers is proposed, which proved to be helpful in routine bone marrow diagnosis in most cases.
