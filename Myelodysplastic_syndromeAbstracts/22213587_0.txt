Shwachman Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) characterized by neutropenia, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and cancer predisposition. Patients are at risk for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) but, unlike other IBMFS, there have been no reported cases of solid tumors. We report a novel case of a solid tumor in a patient with SDS and biallelic mutations in the Shwachman Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene (SBDS). Whether the development of breast cancer in this patient is due to SDS or an isolated case due to unknown factors requires further study.
