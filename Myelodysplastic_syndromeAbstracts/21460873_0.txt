To evaluate safety and efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), derived from frozen aliquots of the original G-CSF-stimulated graft after allogeneic PBSCT from unrelated donors, data of 121 patients with hematological malignancies treated with DLIs were retrospectively analyzed. Indications for PBSCT were AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=63/8), ALL (n=17), lymphoma (n=13), multiple myeloma (n=10) and myeloproliferative syndrome (n=10). Reasons for DLI were hematological relapse (n=81), molecular and/or cytogenetic relapse (n=5), mixed chimerism (n=22) and prophylactic DLI in high-risk patients (n=13). DLIs were well tolerated with no acute adverse reactions. DLI-induced acute-type GvHD (aGvHD) was observed in 19 patients and chronic-type GvHD (cGvHD) developed in 14 patients. Three patients died of GvHD complications. DLI induced CR, complete chimerism or PR in 34 patients; 24 patients had stable disease, 50 patients progressed and 13 patients were not evaluable for response. Objective response was more obvious for molecular relapse (5/5) or mixed chimerism (14/22) compared with hematological relapse (13/81). Median survival after first DLI was 10.4 months (95% confidence interval: 4.4-26.0). Cryopreserved G-CSF-stimulated DLI, derived from allogeneic grafts are safe and immunoreactive, and can be applied early in case of mixed chimerism and molecular or cytogenetic relapse.
