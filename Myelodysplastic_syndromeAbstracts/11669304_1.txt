In this case report, we present a child who was admitted to hospital with the features of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related AIHA. A 14-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of palpitation, icterus, and fatigue for 2 months. She was pale and icteric. Diffuse hepatosplenomegaly was palpated. Hematological examination revealed a hemoglobin of 3.4 g/dl, red blood cell count of 2x10(12)/l, white blood cell count of 3x10(9)/l, platelet count of 14x10(9)/l, and reticulocyte count of 1.7%. Blood smear examination revealed significant anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and tear drop cells. The direct Coomb's test was positive. Bone marrow aspirate showed hypercellularity, micromegakaryocytes, dyserythropoiesis, and dysmyelopoiesis with 2% blasts. The patient was diagnosed with MDS-refractory anemia and AIHA secondary to MDS. Rarely, AIHA can occur secondary to MDS. To our knowledge, this patient is the first pediatric case with MDS and AIHA reported in the literature.
