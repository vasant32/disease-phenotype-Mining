The cell morphology and karyotype of bone marrow samples from 24 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were studied simultaneously with a combined technique of May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes. This enabled us to investigate cell lineage involvement in three malignant conditions: MDS (n = 12), leukaemia-transformed MDS (LT-MDS) (n = 5) and de novo AML (n = 7). In MDS we found blasts and often significant proportions of mature granulocytic and erythroid cells to be cytogenetically abnormal. Percentages of granulocytic and erythroid cells with cytogenetic aberrations were generally less than those of blasts. These data support the involvement of a transformed pluripotent stem cell that has retained maturation abilities. In two patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMMoL) the clonal involvement of monocytes was predominant. Results in the five patients with LT-MDS were similar to those in MDS. In the bone marrow of five of the seven de novo AML patients the cytogenetic abnormalities were restricted to the blasts and did not include the more mature granulocytic or erythroid populations. In the other two patients with AML, both with a t(8;21) and a loss of the Y chromosome, high percentages of mature neutrophils were cytogenetically abnormal. These patterns of clonal lineage involvement in MDS, LT-MDS, t(8;21) AML and AML appear typical and may be of clinical use, for example, for distinguishing LT-MDS from de novo AML in newly presenting patients.
