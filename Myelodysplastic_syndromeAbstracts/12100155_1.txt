We treated six patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with amifostine (200 mg/m(2) i.v./three times a week for three consecutive weeks). Neutrophil counts were more frequently increased than platelet and reticulocyte counts, but no reduction of the transfusion requirement was observed. Significant reduction of the marrow blasts was observed in one case of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts. In vitro stimulation of haematopoiesis was observed in five cases. The apoptotic rate of marrow cells was significantly diminished even after the first course. Our findings show fairly good clinical and biological response to amifostine in MDS.
