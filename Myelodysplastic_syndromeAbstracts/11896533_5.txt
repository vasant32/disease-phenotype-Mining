Patients with advanced MDS and secondary AML respond poorly to chemotherapy. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can stimulate proliferation of leukemic blasts and sensitize these cells to the cytotoxic effects of S-phase-specific drugs. This is the first report of safety and efficacy of GM-CSF prior to and during cytarabine in a low-dose, intermittent regimen for elderly patients with poor risk acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Twenty patients, age 68 to 86 years, each received 250 microg/m2 of GM-CSF (Sargramostatin; Immunex, Seattle, WA, USA) subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.) for 3 days followed by GM-CSF at the same dose and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 i.v. for 3 days. GM-CSF and cytarabine were both administered for 3 days during weeks 2 and 3 followed by a 3-week rest period. Rates of CR and PR were 20% and 40%, respectively. These included clinically significant resolution of cytopenias and transfusion requirements. Many of the responding patients had been heavily pretreated prior to enrollment. One- and 2-year survival estimates are 44% and 19%, respectively. Myelosuppression was the most significant toxicity. Our findings suggest that this novel combination of GM-CSF with sequential and concomitant low-dose cytarabine can benefit patients with poor risk myeloid malignancies.
