 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features and prognosis of the primary myelodysplastic syndrome with myelofibrosis (MDS-MF) patients and to improve the cognition of MDS-MF. METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-six primary MDS patients with bone marrow (BM) biopsy were divided into two groups according to whether BM associated with fibrosis, the clinical features and prognosis of the two groups were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 167 (35.8%) MDS cases revealed myelofibrosis, of which MF-1 123 cases (26.4%), MF-2 40 cases (8.6%), MF-3 4 cases (0.9%). The proportion of hepatosplenomegaly in MDS-MF group was significantly higher than in MDS without MF group, the difference had statistical significance (\%P\% = 0.031). The proliferation of BM biopsy in MDS-MF group was significantly more active than in MDS without MF group. The number of blasts, megakaryocytes and abnormal megakaryocytes in MDS-MF group were significantly higher than in MDS without MF group, the differences had statistical significance (\%P\% < 0.05). Among the 345 patients who had available results of cytogenetic analysis, 121 cases were MDS-MF patients, the proportion of middle and high-risk prognostic group according to IPSS karyotype prognosis groups in MDS-MF group were significantly higher than in MDS without MF group, the differences had statistical significance (\%P\% = 0.047). The median survival was 17 (1 - 60) months in MDS-MF group, and was 32 (1 - 62) months in MDS without MF group. The difference had statistical significance (\%P\% = 0.001). Myelofibrosis had independent prognostic significance by multi-variable analysis (\%P\% = 0.019). CONCLUSION: The myelofibrosis in MDS is main the proliferation of reticular fiber. The proliferation of reticular fiber is closely related with the number of blast cells, the proliferation and developmental abnormalities of megakaryocytes and the karyotype. The prognosis of MDS-MF patients is poor.
