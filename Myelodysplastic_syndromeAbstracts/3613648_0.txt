The proliferation and differentiation effects of the synthetic retinoid TTNPB and of 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) on hemopoietic progenitors from bone marrow of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients were compared. The addition of TTNPB or RA to culture plates containing MDS patient's marrow cells stimulated myeloid colony (CFU-C) growth and caused a significant increase in granulocytic colonies (CFU-G). In the presence of RA the increase in CFU-G was statistically insignificant. Cellular differentiation studies in liquid suspension culture revealed that the two retinoic acid analogues cause a marked decrease in immature granulocytes and an increase in mature granulocytes. There was further an increase in the number of cells that reacted positively with monoclonal antibodies (McAb) binding specifically to granulocytes (B4,3,B13,9 and Leu M4) and a decrease in the percentage of cells reacting with the McAb against Ia-like determinants. These findings indicate that TTNPB is as active as RA in stimulating the growth of hemopoietic progenitors from MDS patients and in enhancing granulocytic differentiation in liquid culture.
