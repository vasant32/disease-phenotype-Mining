We present the case of an elderly man who, while being treated with corticosteroids for a myelodysplastic syndrome, developed myositis of the calf due to Aspergillus fumigatus. Despite therapy with amphotericin B the myositis failed to resolve and he died. At autopsy, a localized necrotizing myositis of the right calf was found with no evidence of disseminated Aspergillus infection. Myositis in the setting of disseminated candidiasis or cryptococcosis has been previously reported. This case is unique in that it is the first reported case of localized fungal myositis and of myositis caused by Aspergillus.
