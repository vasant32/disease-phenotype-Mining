Eighty-nine patients who developed a secondary hematologic disorder and were studied with chromosome analysis were collected from nine institutions. The results of the study confirmed previous findings, in particular, -5/5q-, -7/7q-, -17, and +21 were the most frequently encountered aberrations. Moreover, a t(1;7)(p11;p11) was reported in four cases and consistent chromosome abnormalities were observed in a small group of patients who had been treated only with surgery, but not with chemo- or radiotherapy for a previous tumor.
