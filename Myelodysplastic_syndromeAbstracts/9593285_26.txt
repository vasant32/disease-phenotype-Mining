The EU Concerted Action Workshop on 11q23 Abnormalities in Hematological Malignancies collected 550 patients with abnormalities involving 11q23. Of these, 53 patients had a translocation involving chromosome 11, breakpoint q23, and chromosome 19, breakpoint p13. Karyogram review enabled each patient to be further defined as t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) (21 patients) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) (32 patients). There was a marked difference between the type of banding and the translocation identified: t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) was detected predominantly by R-banding, whereas t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) was detected almost solely by G-banding. Additional change was extremely rare in patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) but occurred in nearly half of the patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). Patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) all had leukemia of a myeloid lineage, mostly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and were predominantly adult. In contrast patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) had malignancies of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage and were mainly infants less than 1 year old. The survival of both groups of patients was generally poor, over 50% of t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) patients died within 2 years of diagnosis and the median survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) was 17.6 months.
