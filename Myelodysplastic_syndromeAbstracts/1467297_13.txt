A case of severe Sweet's syndrome associated with myelodysplasia is reported. The skin lesions responded to high doses of systemic steroids, but recurred rapidly on dose reduction. Treatment with a low dose of cyclosporin resulted in sustained clearance of the skin lesions, and was associated with a stable haemoglobin level, without the need for further blood transfusions.
