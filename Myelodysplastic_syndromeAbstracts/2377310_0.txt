We considered the case of an eighty-three-years-old woman who was admitted to Somma Lombardo Hospital, because of the presence of an acquired sideroblastic idiopathic anaemia accompanied by a cyclic hypereosinophilia of undefined significance. The case is reported both because references about sideroblastic idiopathic anaemia with hypereosinophilia of undefined significance are rare in the literature and because it may support the hypothesis that hypereosinophilia ensues from the myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore it is possible that when diagnosing acquired sideroblastic idiopathic anaemia, not only thrombocytopenia, but hypereosinophilia has to be considered as an unfavourable prognostic marker for early appearance of acute non-lymphoid leukemia.
