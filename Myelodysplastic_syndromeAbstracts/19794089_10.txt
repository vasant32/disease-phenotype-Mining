X-linked neutropenia (XLN) is a rare form of Congenital Neutropenia (CN) caused by inherited gain-of-function mutations of WAS. Here we report 2 cases of the original L270P X-linked neutropenia kindred that evolved to MDS or AML, with acquisition of G-CSFR (CSF3R) mutations and monosomy 7. Thus, leukemic transformation with acquisition of CSF3R mutations and monosomy 7 is not restricted to classical congenital neutropenia with autosomal inheritance, but can also occur in other genotypes of inherited neutropenia.
