 BACKGROUND: There is little long-term follow-up information after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin's disease. We evaluated the influence of various prognostic factors and examined the outcome in 128 such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received high dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide followed by autologous hematopoietic rescue. RESULTS: Patients have been observed between 50-130 months (median 77 months) following transplantation. Overall survival at four years is estimated as 45 percent, and failure-free survival as 25 percent. The best results were seen in patients with a good performance status, who had failed at most one prior chemotherapy regimen. Failure-free survival at four years is estimated as 53 percent for this group. Relapses more than 24 months after transplantation were seen in 11 patients. Five patients developed myelodysplastic syndromes. Three patients became pregnant after the transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged failure-free survival may be observed following high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic rescue in patients with Hodgkin's disease. Superior results were seen in patients without extensive prior chemotherapy and in those with a good performance status. Late relapses and deaths from secondary myelodysplastic syndromes mandate prolonged follow-up after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin's disease.
