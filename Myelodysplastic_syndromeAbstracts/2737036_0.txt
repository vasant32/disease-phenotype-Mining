By use of limiting dilution assay, it is confirmed that most of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, had defect in the stage of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell. With light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, colonies which originated from leukemic progenitor cells (L-CFU) were ascertained. The incorporated rates of 3H-TdR and 55 + 59Fe showed that proliferative manner of LCFU was apparently different from that of normal adults.
