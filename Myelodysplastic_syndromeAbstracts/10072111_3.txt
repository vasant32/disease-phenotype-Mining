It is sometimes reported that the immunological abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) induce autoimmune disease (i.e., acute systemic vasculitic syndrome, chronic cutaneous vasculitis, polyneuropathy, relapsing polychondritis, and steroid-responsive pulmonary disorders). We investigated the clinical features of patients with MDS accompanied by nephrotic syndrome. We enrolled 125 patients with MDS who were admitted between January 1979 and May 1996 in this study. The renal function was assessed based on the laboratory data and the findings at the physical examination. The diagnoses of nephrotic syndrome and glomerular disease were established when 24-hr urinary excretion was more than 3.5 g and serum total protein was less than 6.0 g/dl, and when the 24-hr protein excretion was more than 1.5 g. Five patients (4%) had glomerular disease, and three (2.4%) had nephrotic syndrome. Of the five patients with glomerular disease, two had refractory anemia (RA), and three had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMOL). Three of the total 11 patients with CMMOL were diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome. Among the CMMOL patients, those with nephrotic syndrome showed higher absolute monocyte numbers than did those without nephrotic syndrome (8830 +/- 4677/microl vs. 3061 +/- 2887/microl, P = 0.03). One CMMOL patient was treated with VP-16 and hydroxyurea. As the white blood cell count in this patient decreased, the 24-hr urine protein excretion and the serum tumor necrosis factor alpha level decreased. The relationship between nephrotic syndrome and CMMOL was not clear. High monocyte count and the serum cytokines in MDS patients may play a partial role in the evolution of glomerulonephritis, and CMMOL may be closely related to nephrotic syndrome.
