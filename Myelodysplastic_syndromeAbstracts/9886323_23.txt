We performed flow cytometric analysis of CD34+ cell apoptosis in 59 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) secondary to MDS (MDS-AML) using annexin V-FITC, which binds to exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was significantly increased in FAB subtypes RA, RARS and RAEB (<10% blasts) (56.5% (15.1-86.5%)) compared to normal controls (18.5% (3.4-33.4%), P<0.0001) and RAEB-t/MDS-AML (16% (2.1-43.2%), P<0.0001). There was no correlation between % apoptosis, Full blood count or cytogenetics in any disease category. Two-colour cytometric analysis of permeabilized CD34+ cells stained with antibodies to Bcl-2, Bcl-X (anti-apoptotic), Bax and Bad (pro-apoptotic), demonstrated significantly higher ratios of pro- v anti-apoptotic proteins in early MDS (2.47 (1.19-9.42) compared to advanced disease (1.14 (0.06-3.32), P=0.0001). Moreover, using repeated measures of variants (ANOVA), we found that variations between individual Bcl-2-related proteins differed significantly according to disease subtype (P<0.0005). Our results confirm that CD34+ cell apoptosis was significantly increased in MDS subtypes RA and RARS and fell with disease progression. Early MDS was also associated with a significantly higher CD34+ cell pro- v anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family-protein ratio than advanced disease. Furthermore, patterns of expression of individual Bcl-2 related proteins differed significantly between different disease categories. However, no correlation between pro- v anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family-protein ratios and the degree of apoptosis was observed.
