The efficacy of low-dose cytarabine given as 10 mg sub-cutaneously 12 hourly for 2 weeks and repeated at 2 to 3 weekly intervals was evaluated prospectively in 15 consecutive patients of myelodysplastic syndrome over a 3 year period. Response to therapy was assessed clinically and by haematological parameters including bone marrow examination. No patient achieved complete remission. Three patients responded partially. Four patients transformed into acute myelogenous leukaemia. Overall, the results of therapy were disappointing as all the 15 patients died within 6 months of diagnosis.
