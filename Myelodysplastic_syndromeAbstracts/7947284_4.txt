The clonality of purified cells was examined in 10 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients by analysing the restriction fragment length polymorphism and methylation pattern of the phosphoglycerate-kinase gene. Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity was also examined. The granulocytes and monocytes were monoclonal or oligoclonal in all cases, except for the monocytes in one case. Conversely, the NK and T cells had a polyclonal pattern in most cases, including all cases who had defective NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The hypothesis that reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in MDS is caused by a clonal involvement of NK cells was not supported by the present study.
