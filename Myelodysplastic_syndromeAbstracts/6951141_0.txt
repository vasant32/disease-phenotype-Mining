The expression of results obtained in in vitro bone marrow cell culture as per ml of aspirated marrow instead of per 10(5) nucleated cells plated as studied in 41 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 79 patients with a dysmyelopoietic syndrome. Four types of growth were found in AML patients: three with hypercellular marrow and either (a) microclusters, (b) isolated cells, or (c) macroclusters and a complete remission (CR) rate of 86%, 63%, and 14% respectively; (d) relative hypocellular marrow with a CR rate of 0%. This type of poorly responsive AML patient has recently been described [17]. Patients with dysmyelopoietic syndromes were subdivided into three groups according to th type of in vitro growth: subnormal, decreased, and leukemic. There was a good correlation between these in vitro groups and the outcome of patients: long survival, death from hemorrhagic and/or infectious complications, leukemic transformation (logrank test: chi 2 = 9.12, df = 2, p = 0.01).
