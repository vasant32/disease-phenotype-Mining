A patient with myelodysplastic syndrome developed pericardial effusion 20 month after allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Sclerotic and erythematous skin lesions were observed over the face and extremities, and a diagnosis of chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD) was made based on skin biopsy findings. Pericardial fluid contained numerous CD8+/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes, but no leukaemic cells. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and soluble Fas (sFas) levels were highly elevated in both the effusion and serum. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and tacrolimus. Skin GVHD improved rapidly associated with resolution of pericardial effusion and reductions in cytokine levels. We concluded that pericardial effusion was due to pericarditis and was a manifestation of chronic GVHD in this patient, and that cytotoxic lymphocytes and specific cytokines played significant roles.
