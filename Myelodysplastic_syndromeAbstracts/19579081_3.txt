 INTRODUCTION: Experience with the use of allogeneic hemopoietic stem transplantation (AHSCT) in pediatric myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) in Spain is reviewed. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Twenty-four children with MDS were analyzed retrospectively. Median age of the patients was 10 years. Twenty patients received a bone marrow graft and 4 an unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplant; 12 bone marrow grafts were from a matched related donor (MRD) and 8 from a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Conditioning regimen consisted of chemotherapy alone in 17 patients (busulfan and cyclophosphamide +/- melfalan) Seven patients received TBI and cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Ten patients died from transplant-related toxicity and 4 had relapse or disease progression post-AHSCT. Nine patients are alive and event-free with a median follow-up of 120 months. EFS rate in the MRD group was 0.48 (SE 0.13) versus 0.25 (SE 0.12) in the MUD/UCB group (p = .07). Lansky score in survivors is >or=90%. CONCLUSIONS: In this historical series of children with MDS, in spite of severe transplant-related toxicity, encouraging EFS outcomes have been achieved after AHSCT with good quality of life.
