Four patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were given low dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) therapy. One patient with de novo AML and two patients having refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) achieved responses. Although the responses lasted for only a short duration (2-3 months), the therapy was well tolerated and not accompanied by severe complications, while severe cytopenia was a frequent side effect with transfusions being necessary in most patients. This therapy could be clinically effective for certain types of AML and MDS (especially RAEB and RAEB in transformation).
