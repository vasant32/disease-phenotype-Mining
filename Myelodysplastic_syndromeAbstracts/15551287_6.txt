We describe a 75-year-old man with neutropenia in whom bone marrow aspirate and biopsy demonstrated hemophagocytosis associated with myelodysplasia (MDS). Therapy with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) caused splenomegaly and severe thrombocytopenia, which recurred upon rechallenge. We propose that myeloid growth factors may be detrimental in patients with MDS-associated hemophagocytosis.
