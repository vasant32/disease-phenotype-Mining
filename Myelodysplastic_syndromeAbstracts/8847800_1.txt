A number of studies have shown that regular chelation therapy with deferoxamine is effective in patients with secondary hemochromatosis. However, compliance with these regimen is difficult to obtain in most cases because long-term administration is burdensome. In 3 patients, one each with myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia and thalassemia intermedia, self-administered subcutaneous one-shot administration of deferoxamine at a dose of 500 mg once or twice daily was carried out over a long period. In all three patients serum ferritin level decreased significantly and the progression of hemochromatosis was prevented. Liver density on computed tomography scan also decreased in one patient. This regimen, in which the patient self-administered deferoxamine subcutaneously one or twice a day is seems to be the most practical method to protect against the progression of hemochromatosis.
