Many patients with hematologic malignancies show immunosuppression and/or neutropenia,  and are at a high risk of developing a serious infection that would require empiric therapy  with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, a thorough comparison of the efficacies of different  carbapenems has not been carried out. To compare the efficacies of meropenem (MEPM) and  doripenem (DRPM) in febrile patients with hematologic neoplasms, we retrospectively reviewed  data of 149 consecutive febrile patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic  leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who were treated empirically with MEPM or DRPM. The  duration from the start of carbapenem administration to decline of fever was not significantly  different between the MEPM and DRPM groups (median, 3 versus 4 days; P = 0.79). Multivariate  analysis showed that a diagnosis of MDS and the use of liposomal amphotericin-B or voriconazole  are statistically significant risk factors for sustained fever. In conclusion, MEPM and DRPM  showed similar efficacies in febrile patients with acute leukemia and MDS.
