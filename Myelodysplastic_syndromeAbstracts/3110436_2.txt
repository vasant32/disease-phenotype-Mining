We report 2 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after thiotepa instillation into the bladder for superficial bladder carcinoma and review 4 additional cases from the literature. Intravesical thiotepa is absorbed systemically in patients with bladder carcinoma and such treatment may be associated with the rare occurrence of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and/or the myelodysplastic syndrome.
