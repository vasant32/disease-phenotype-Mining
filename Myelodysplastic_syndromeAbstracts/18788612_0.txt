 OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathogenesis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and improve the differential diagnosis from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was performed to detect the point mutation of codon 12,13 in N-ras gene and codon 301, 969 in fms gene in adult and aged ITP and MDS patients. RESULTS: In 25 ITP patients, N-ras mutation and fms mutation were detected in one each (4%). Mutations were found in 3 of 8 MDS patients: two (25%) with N-ras mutation and one (12.5%) with fms mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with N-ras or fms gene mutation diagnosed as MDS rather than ITP.
