A patient with massive rectal bleeding due to ileal tuberculosis is reported. Technetium-99m labelled red blood cell scintigraphy indicated hemorrhage from the ileum, and laparotomy was then carried out. A 70-cm segment of ileum containing ulcers and erosions was resected, and epitheloid granuloma with Langhans-type giant cell was found in the resected specimen. Massive rectal bleeding is considered a rare presenting symptom of intestinal tuberculosis. Intestinal tuberculosis, including small intestinal tuberculosis, although uncommon, should be taken into consideration as a cause of rectal bleeding.
