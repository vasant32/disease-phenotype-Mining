Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is being increasingly used in healthy volunteers to harvest haemopoietic stem cells. A possible role of G-CSF in the development of clonal disorders or leukaemia has been suggested. We analysed 144 patients with aplastic anaemia treated with immunosuppression protocols with or without G-CSF, with normal cytogenetics at diagnosis or immediately after immunosuppression. Our findings indicated that the risk of developing myelodysplasia or leukaemia was similar in patients with aplastic anaemia on immunosuppressive treatment with or without G-CSF. Therefore, it seems unlikely that G-CSF causes leukaemia in healthy volunteers.
