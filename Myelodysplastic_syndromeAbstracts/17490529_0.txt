The study was aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of vitamin K(2) (VK(2)) on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cell line MUTZ-1 in vitro. The flow cytometry was used to analyze apoptosis rate and the change of cell cycle. The expression of apoptosis-related genes bcl-2, survivin and bax were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The activity of caspase-3 was detected by chemiluminescence assay. The results indicated that the apoptosis peak on FCM and positive Annexin-V FITC on cell membrane showed that VK(2) induced apoptosis of MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-and-time-dependent manner, S and G(2) cell decrement, G(0)/G(1) cell arrest, VK(2) significantly down-regulated the expression of bcl-2 and survivin, but had no effect on the expression of bax, the activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased. It is concluded that VK(2) induces apoptosis of MUTZ-1 cells through activating caspase-3 pathways and the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and survivin may play important roles in the process of apoptosis induction.
