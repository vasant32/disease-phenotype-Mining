We performed a single institution retrospective analysis of 114 patients treated with BU-based pretransplant conditioning regimens. Oral BU was administered to 76 patients (total dose 16 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) and i.v. BU to 38 others (total dose 12.8 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg). Either CY (n=74) or fludarabine (n=40) was given in combination with BU. Median age was 35 years in the oral BU group and 48.5 years with i.v. BU (P<0.001). OS and PFS rates at 3-years post HSCT were not different in patients who received either i.v. or oral BU (OS: 41.3 vs 44.0% (P=0.981); PFS: 52.7 vs 54.7% (P=0.526), respectively). The i.v. BU, however, was associated with a significantly shorter time to engraftment (13.5 days vs 16 days, respectively; P<0.001). There were no significant differences in survival or 100-day mortality for patients who received either CY or fludarabine, in combination with BU. After adjustment for confounders, multivariate analysis showed that age of transplant (P=0.002), donor type (sibling or unrelated; P=0.003), GVHD (P<0.05) and route of administration (P=0.023) were significant risk factors for OS. The i.v. BU used in an older age group yielded equivalent survival compared with oral BU used in a younger population.
