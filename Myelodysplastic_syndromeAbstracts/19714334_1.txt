Relapsing polychondritis is an episodic and progressive systemic inflammatory disease characterized by auricular chondritis, polyarthritis, nasal and respiratory tract chondritis. About 30% of the patients have additional autoimmune and or hematological diseases, most frequently systemic vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, myelodysplastic syndromes or systemic lupus erythematosus. So far, only one case of coexisting relapsing polychondritis and sarcoidosis in a patient with AIDS has been reported. We describe here a case of sarcoidosis and relapsing polychondritis in an immunocompetent patient. Physicians should be aware of this possible association.
