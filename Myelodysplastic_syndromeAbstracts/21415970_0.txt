Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Most patients with MDS are older than 60 years and age-associated morbidities limit the patients' options for curative transplant therapy. Since the development of conditioning regimens with reduced toxicity, the age limitations for HCT have waned for those patients with good performance status. This review will discuss the role of HCT for MDS based on prognostic features, the optimal timing of HCT, and outcomes based on patient age.
