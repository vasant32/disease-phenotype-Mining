Mutations at exon 12 of the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene are the most frequent acquired molecular abnormalities in adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with normal karyotype. We screened 28 patients with new diagnosed primary AML with normal karyotype, 38 patients with myelodysplastic symdromes (MDS) and 19 healthy volunteer for mutations at exon 12 of NPM1 gene. NPM1 mutations were identified in four AML patients and two MDS patients, including one novel sequence variant. As far as we know, this is the first report of NPM1 mutation in patients with MDS in the English literature until now, and our primary data support that NPM1 mutations may be also involved in the pathogenesis of MDS.
