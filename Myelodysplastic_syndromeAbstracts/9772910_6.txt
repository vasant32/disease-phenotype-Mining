Microsatellites are short, repeated DNA sequences that exist throughout the genome. Instability of these sequences, associated with defects in the DNA mismatch repair system, is the hallmark of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and is also found in many sporadic cancers. Although many types of solid tumors exhibit this type of genetic instability, its involvement in hematologic cancers is less evident. We have investigated whether microstatellite instability (MSI) is involved in the transformation of myeloid cells to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Both de novo and treatment-associated neoplasias were studied. Only one example of MSI was found in 48 patients, using a panel of 14 different microsatellite loci consisting of repeats of one to four base pairs. These results suggest that the genes responsible for MSI are not involved in the transformation of normal myeloid cells to MDS or AML.
