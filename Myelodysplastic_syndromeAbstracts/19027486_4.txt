Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that is characterized by peculiar clinical and biologic features, including severe hemorrhagic diathesis, specific recurrent chromosomal aberration, and distinct morphologic features with predominant pathologic promyelocytes. A reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q22;q21), is a characteristic feature of APL that represents approximately 5-8% of AML. The rearranged gene created by this translocation encodes a chimeric protein PML-RARA that is a transcriptional repressor. In contrast to other AML subtypes, APL is particularly sensitive to treatment with all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with chemotherapy, converting this once fatal leukemia to a highly curable disease. Nonetheless, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) has been reported as a rare complication of chemotherapy in APL. Of 30 APL cases described as t-MDS/AML in the literature, only 1 case relapsed as acute leukemia with t(3;21)(q26;q22). Here we describe a rare case of APL relapsing as secondary AML with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and clinically characterize this patient using the RUNX1 (previously AML1)-MDS1-EVI1 fusion transcript (with follow-up for 55 months), and review the relevant literature.
