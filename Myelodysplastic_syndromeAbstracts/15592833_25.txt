This study evaluated the impact of a new epoetin alfa dosing regimen on quality of life (QOL), transfusion requirements, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels in 133 patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Hb < or =10 g/dl. Epoetin alfa 40,000 IU was given subcutaneously twice weekly; after 4 weeks, the dose could be reduced to 40,000 IU weekly in patients achieving erythroid response. QOL was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire. FACT-An scores increased on average by 7.5 after 4 weeks and by 8.8 after 8 weeks compared with baseline. FACT-An scores were positively associated with Hb values (r=0.53, P<0.01). The mean FACT-An score increase at week 8 was 10.2 in responders and 5.6 in nonresponders. The overall erythroid response rate at week 8 was 68%: 74% in transfusion-independent patients and 59% in transfusion-dependent patients. Of all responders at week 8, response was maintained in 86% at week 12, 71% at week 16, 65% at week 20, and 54% at week 24. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Our data provide new and encouraging results regarding the benefits of 40,000 IU biweekly induction doses followed by 40,000 IU weekly in improving QOL, correcting anemia, and reducing transfusion requirements in low-risk MDS patients.
