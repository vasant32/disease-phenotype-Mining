This study was aimed to investigate the distribution of chromosomal aberrational karyotype in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subgroups, the characterizations of numerical and structural aberration. The chromosome was prepared with simple culture of bone marrow, and the karyotype was analysed by G banding technique. The results showed tht 54 out of 127 patients (42.5%) had clonal chromosome aberrations, and the abnormal rates were different in subgroups: 30% (3/10) in MDS-RA, 35.9% (23/64) in MDS-RCMD, 22.2% (2/9) in MDS-RAS, 45% (9/20) in MDS-RAEB-I, 66.7% (14/21) in MDS-RAEB-II, 100% (3/3) in 5q-syndrome, respectively. Among 54 abnormal chromosome patients, 21 patients showed numerical aberration, 14 patients showed structural aberration, and the other 19 patients showed both numerical and structural aberration. The order of frequent aberrations was as follows complex karyotype (11.02%, 14/127), single +8 (10.24%, 13/127), -7/7q- (3.9%, 5/127), 1q+ (3.15%, 4/127), -X/-Y (3.15%, 4/127), 20q- (2.36%, 3/127), 5q- (2.36%, 3/127). The frequency of complex karyotype in MDS-RAEB (including RAEB-I and RAEB-II) was higher than that in non MDS-RAEB (including RA, RCMD, RAS, 5q-syndrome) (P < 0.05), and the frequency of balanced translocation was lower than that in non-balanced translocation (P < 0.05), and both of the two balanced translocation patients were found in MDS-RAEB. It is concluded that MDS is highly heterogenous clonal disorder, a great majority of cytogenetic changes can be detected and most of which are recurrent aberrations, balanced translocations are rare, and only found in MDS-RAEB. The frequency of complex karyotype in MDS-RAEB is higher, and the patients with dup (1) (q21q32) recurrent abnormality is common in this study.
