The AMEX method of fixation permitted the serial study of c-myc expression in bone-marrow (BM) biopsies obtained from 6 patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) during therapy with various cytotoxic and bioactive agents. BM cytotoxic therapy and therapy with bioactive agents was capable of altering c-myc expression in vivo. While cytotoxic therapy was generally associated with a fall in myc expression, it did not produce a dramatic effect on myc expression. Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (RhGM-CSF) can increase and retinoic acid/alpha-interferon can decrease c-myc expression in myeloid cells in vivo.
