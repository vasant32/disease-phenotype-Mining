Six patients, 4 with acute myeloid leukaemia and 2 with a myelodysplastic syndrome who were refractory to random donor platelet transfusions and alloimmunized to human leucocyte antigens (HLA) and human platelet alloantigens (HPA), were treated with HLA- and HPA-matched platelet transfusions. In all the patients refractoriness and alloantibodies to HLA as well as HPA-1b or HPA-5b were detected simultaneously. Sixty-seven transfusions (445 units) of HLA- and HPA-matched platelets were given and responses to them were, in general, satisfactory in all the patients. No major spontaneous bleeding occurred. Four patients underwent bone marrow transplantation despite alloimmunization. The percentages of platelet transfusion days with a platelet nadir below 20x10(9)/l were 88% for the last 3 random donor platelet transfusions and 39% for the first 3 HLA- and HPA-matched platelet transfusions, respectively (p=0.009, Fisher's exact test). Four patients received also HLA-matched platelets, but responses to them were poor. The small number of transfusions with HLA-matched platelets precluded comparisons to either the random donor or HLA- and HPA-matched platelet transfusions. It seems that HLA- and HPA-alloimmunized patients can be successfully supported with HLA- and HPA-matched platelet concentrates.
