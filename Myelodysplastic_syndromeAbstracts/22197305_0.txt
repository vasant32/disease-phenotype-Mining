Legionnaire's disease is a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in normal hosts, but those with impaired cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and T-lymphocyte function are particularly predisposed to Legionella species CAP. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disorder of the elderly that is associated with impaired CMI. Cases of MDS or Legionella species CAP are rare. Splenectomized patients primarily have impaired humoral immunity and B-lymphocyte function, and, to a lesser extent, some decrease in CMI. For this reason, Legionnaire's disease has rarely been reported in splenectomized patients. We believe this to be the first reported case of Legionella pneumophila CAP in an asplenic patient with MDS.
