Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtype, characterized by monocytosis, dysgranulocytosis and a low number of blast cells in the peripheral blood (PB). The clonal nature of MDS has been demonstrated by various techniques: the stem cell involved initially is capable of myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique which can be utilized without any pretreatment on whole interphase cells. In this study leukocytes of PB Wright-stained smears from four CMML patients with trisomy 8 (three cases) and 9 (one case) have been analyzed by FISH. Utilizing a probe for the centromere of chromosome 8 and for the heterochromatic region of chromosome 9, we observed the cells involved by trisomy. In each of the four cases neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes may show trisomy 8 or 9, whereas lymphocytes resulted disomic. The comparison between leukocytes morphology and genotype suggests that the supernumerary chromosome does not influence cellular differentiation and maturation. We conclude that FISH analysis of PB leukocytes of patients with CMML is informative when studying the clonality of the disease. Chromosomal abnormalities seem to involve a hematopoietic cell committed to myeloid but not lymphoid differentiation. Trisomies 8 and 9 seem to confer some proliferative advantage without influencing the morphologic characteristics of leukocytes. Other causes will be investigated to explain dysmorphisms of neutrophils and monocytes typical of this disease.
