Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid disorders with various clinical and biological presentations. The French-American-British (FAB-1982) classification included five categories basing on morphology and bone marrow blast count. Three criteria are taken into account: 1) the percentage of blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow, 2) the percentage of ringed sideroblasts, and 3) the number of monocytes in peripheral blood. The World Health Organization classification (WHO 2001, 2008) modifies the FAB system by also taking cytogenetic characteristics and molecular biology into consideration. The last classification (WHO-2008) takes into account: 1) the number of peripheral cytopenia, 2) the percentage of blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow, 3) the percentage of ringed sideroblasts, 4) the possible presence of Auer Rods, and 5) the detection of a cytogenetic abnormality (the isolated 5q deletion). The following subgroups are defined: refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, myelodysplastic syndrome unclassifiable and myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q).
