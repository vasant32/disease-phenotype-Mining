Responses have been reported in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) or 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-CRA) therapy. Recently, combination of these two substances in vitro was shown to produce a synergistic effect on differentiation of leukemic cells. We conducted a phase II trial with low-dose Ara-C (5 mg/m2 per 12 h s.c.) and 13-CRA (60 mg/m2 per day orally) in 14 patients with MDS, six of whom had refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), seven had RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) and one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The drugs were administered from day 1 to 14 and the treatment courses repeated every 4 to 8 weeks. One partial response and one minor response could be achieved. Major toxicity included dry skin, mucositis and cheilitis in 11 of the 14 patients. The response rate is no better than the results reported in the literature with either drugs alone. As yet there is no satisfactory treatment for MDS.
