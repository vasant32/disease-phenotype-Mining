Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a malignant tumour of myeloblasts rarely occurring in the maxillary bone. The tumour may precede or be concurrent with leukaemic infiltration of the bone marrow or herald blastic transformation of a myelodysplastic syndrome or a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Myeloid sarcoma is uncommon in the oral cavity, but it can involve the palate, gingiva, extraction socket, and cheek. Recognition and diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma involving the soft tissues of the oral cavity in an otherwise asymptomatic patient is important and mandates an appropriate haematological diagnostic workup. We herein report on a new case without any evidence of haematological disorders. We discuss the pathological diagnosis and the therapeutical approaches.
