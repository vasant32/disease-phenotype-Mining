BACKGROUND: The records and initial bone marrow studies of 106 patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether bone marrow dysplasia was predictive of a previous myelodysplastic disorder or correlated with remission rate and survival. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens were reviewed in a blinded fashion; dysplasia was assessed in as objective a manner as possible by numerically scoring nine specific findings: erythrocyte multinuclearity, nuclear fragmentation, megaloblastic characteristics, leukocyte granulation abnormalities and nuclear malformations, Pelger-Huet cells, and megakaryocytic dysplasia (mononuclear megakaryocytes, micromegakaryocytes, and megakaryocytes with multiple distinct nuclei). RESULTS: Dysplasia of the megakaryocytic line was seen in 34% of patients; 70% of the patients had erythrocyte dysplasia; and 68% had leukocyte dysplasia. Pelger-Huet cells were seen in bone marrow of 35% of the patients. Overall dysplasia score and specific dysplastic findings such as Pelger-Huet cells did not correlate with a known history of myelodysplasia (P = 0.47), cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.35), prior chemotherapy treatment with or without alkylating agents (P = 1.00), previous malignant disorders such as polycythemia vera (P = 1.00), remission rate (P = 0.93), or survival (P = 0.42). Multivariate analysis confirmed known independent risk factors for remission in this patient population, including age (P = 0.04), history of prior chemotherapy (P = 0.04), abnormalities in chromosomes 5, 7, or 8 (P = 0.02), and type of antileukemia therapy (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow dysplasia is common in patients with AML and does not correlate with a history of myelodysplasia or predict outcome when patients are treated with standard intensive AML therapy.
