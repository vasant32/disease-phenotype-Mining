DNA contents of c-FMS and GM-CSF genes were analyzed by densitometer in nine patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia associated with abnormality of chromosome 5. Five patients with deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5 had loss of both c-FMS and GM-CSF genes. These findings suggest that c-FMS oncogene and GM-CSF gene locating in the critical region on chromosome 5 seem to have an important role in the process of leukemogenesis.
