As a zinc-finger protein, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) controls brown fat determination by stimulating brown fat-selective genes expression while suppressing the expression of genes selective for white fat cells, whose mutations were associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemogenesis in human and murine model of leukemia. To date, no polymorphisms of PRDM16 gene in bovine had been reported. Herein, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing methods were employed to screen the genetic variation within PRDM16 gene in 1031 Chinese indigenous bovine. The results revealed two novel silent mutations: XM_001788152: m.1641T>C (547aa), 1881G>A (627aa). Hence, we described the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLP methods for detecting these mutations, respectively. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with PvuII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-C allele varied from 0.044 to 0.506 in four Chinese native breeds. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with HaeIII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-G allele were 0.474, 0.494, 0.576 and 0.906 for Jiaxian (JX), Nanyang (NY), Qinchuan (QC) and Chinese Holstein (CH) population. Significant statistical differences between genotypic frequencies implied that both of the polymorphic loci were significantly associated with cattle breeds by the chi square test (chi2 = 190.058, P < 0.001 and chi2 = 118.239, P < 0.001 for PvuII; chi2 = 209.842, P < 0.001 and chi2 = 108.711, P < 0.001 for HaeIII). The associations of the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLPs of bovine PRDM16 loci with growth traits were analyzed in Nanyang breed. The two SNPs were associated with body weight and average daily gain in Nanyang aged 12 months, individuals with genotype TT and AA showed significantly better body weight (P < 0.05) and average daily gain (P < 0.01) at 12 months, respectively.
