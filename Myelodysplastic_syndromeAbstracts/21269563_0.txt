Copy-number variations (CNVs) have been found in association with various types of diseases, including hematological malignancies. A recent array-based study implicated the presence of CNVs of ZMAT4 in the genome of acute myelogenous leukemia. In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multitypes of hematological malignancies as well as healthy controls. We found significant association between the CNVs of ZMAT4 and these hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. We also examined the expression of ZMAT4 mRNA in the samples with 1 or 2 copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In conclusion, the CNVs of ZMAT4 have the potential to serve as a diagnostic indicator, alone or in combination with other markers, for hematological malignancies.
