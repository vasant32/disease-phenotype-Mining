In this study, we attempted to evaluate the clinical significance of T helper 1 (Th1)/T helper 2 (Th2) ratio in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), five refractory anaemia (RA), four refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 31 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), nine refractory anaemia with excess blast-1 (RAEB-1) and seven refractory anaemia with excess blast-2 (RAEB-2). Intracellular interleukin-4 (Th2 cytokine) and interferon-gamma (Th1 cytokine) production was assessed in CD4+ T lymphocytes activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin using flow cytometry. Mean Th1/Th2 ratios in each MDS group were as follows: RA/RARS, 8.8 (95% CI, 5.8-11.8), RCMD, 14.7 (95% CI, 9.5-19.9), RAEB-1, 10.6 (95% CI, 4.6-16.6), RAEB-2, 12.8 (95% CI, 3.0-22.7) and control 12.8 (95% CI, 9.6-16.1). There were no significant differences in Th1/Th2 ratio in the RA/RARS, RCMD, RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subgroups when compared to controls. Because Th1/Th2 ratio in the RCMD group was widely distributed, we divided RCMD patients according to Th1/Th2 ratio into three groups (low, normal and high Th1/Th2 groups). There were no differences in severity of cytopenia among the three above groups. However, the percentage of CD8 cells in the low Th1/Th2 group was significantly lower than those in the high group (P < 0.01). These data suggest that Th1/Th2 imbalance induces CD4/CD8 imbalance, and serves as a marker of the biological interplay in immune regulation.
