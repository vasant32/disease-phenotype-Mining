Platelets collected from random and multiple donors were as effective on transfusion as those obtained from single donor by platelet pheresis if patients were not alloimmunized. In alloimmunized patients, effects of platelet transfusion were correlated with the HLA-matching grade; 100% effective in A-match, 92% in B-match and 65% in C-match. This correlation was not observed if the patient had infection. The transfusion of A- or B-matched platelets resulted in a lowering or disappearance of HLA antibody activities in most patients. However, the transfusion of C-matched platelets caused increasing or appearance of HLA antibody activities in some patients. The ABO-incompatibility did not show a significant effect on platelet transfusion when anti-A or anti-B antibody activities in donors and antiglobulin tests on patients' red cells were negligible. Non HLA, platelet specific antibodies were produced in some patients and presumed to be participated in the destruction of transfused HLA-matched platelets.
