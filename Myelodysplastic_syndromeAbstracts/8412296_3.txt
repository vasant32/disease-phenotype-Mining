By staining human bone marrow cells with a monoclonal antibody reacting with erythroid precursor cells (AS-E1) and propidium iodide, we have evaluated the proliferative capacity of erythropoiesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) using flow cytometry. Comparing 36 patients (13 RA/RAS, 13 RAEB, 10 RAEB-t) with 7 normal controls, significant differences in both the percentage of AS-E1+ cells and the fraction of AS-E1+ cells in the S or S-G2M-phase between the four groups were found. Since neither the percentage of AS-E1+ cells nor their fraction in S or S-G2M alone was found to characterize their proliferative activity, we introduced the proliferative fractions of the erythroid cell, i.e. the number of the AS-E1+ cells in S or S-G2M related to all bone marrow cells in S or S-G2M. Applying these parameters, we found significantly increased proliferative AS-E1 fractions in the RA/RAS group compared to the normal controls (p = 0.03 and 0.002) respectively, as well as a highly significant decrease with disease progression.
