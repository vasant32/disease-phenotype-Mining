Three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) had absent or extremely low levels of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity (arbitrarily defined as an NAP score <10). All patients showed varying degrees of hypogranulation in neutrophil morphology. The NAP activity levels transiently normalized following the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in two cases. No patients experienced any severe infectious episodes. These results suggest that NAP activity is not central to the neutrophil function.
