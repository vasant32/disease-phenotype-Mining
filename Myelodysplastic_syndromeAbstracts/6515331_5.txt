The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterised by dysplastic marrow and cytopenia. Clinically detectable bleeding is uncommon and usually attributed to thrombocytopenia. We have investigated some aspects of haemostatic function in 17 patients with MDS and compared the results with findings from 17 control patients matched for age and sex. No specific disorder of blood coagulation or fibrinolysis was identified. The main abnormalities observed in the patients were: prolongation of the bleeding time which was greater than could be explained on the basis of thrombocytopenia in 13 patients; absent, or severely impaired platelet aggregation in response to collagen in 7 patients; impaired platelet production of malondialydehyde when stimulated with collagen and abnormal release of 14C-5 hydroxytryptamine in 5 patients; and abnormalities of ultrastructure in all 5 patients whose platelets were viewed by electron microscopy.
