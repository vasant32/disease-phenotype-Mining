The proliferative induction by hemopoietic growth factors may provide a useful tool to improve the mitotic yield of hemopoietic cells, allowing a more accurate cytogenetic analysis in hematologic malignancies. For such a purpose, we studied the effects of the recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3) on the mitotic index and the karyotype of bone marrow cells from 14 patients with myelodysplastic (MDS) and myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS). The mitotic response to IL-3 of normal bone marrow samples was also evaluated. Total bone marrow cells were cultured for 24 to 72 hours either in presence or absence of rhIL-3. In most cases, IL-3--stimulated samples showed a considerably higher (4-70 times) mitotic index than unstimulated controls. Although a great patient-to-patient variability was observed, a common pattern of mitogenic response to IL-3 emerged among MPS, MDS, and normal cases. At 48 hours of incubation, the mean mitotic index from MPS and MDS cases stimulated with IL-3 was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than unstimulated controls, whereas the mean mitotic increase from normal samples did not reach statistical significance (p greater than 0.1). Even though not statistically evaluable, a similar trend of response was observed at 24 and 72 hours of culture. Chromosome studies of MPS and MDS cases showed the same karyotype either in stimulated and unstimulated samples.
