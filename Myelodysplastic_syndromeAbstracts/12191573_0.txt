We report a case of chronic myelogeneous leukaemia (CML) in B-lineage lymphoid blastic crisis (BC) having chromosome abnormality, inv(16)(p13;q22) in addition to Philadelphia chromosome, in 20/20 marrow metaphase. Inv(16)(p13;q22) was not observed in cells of chronic phase or accelerate phase. Abnormalities of chromosome 16, including inv(16)(p13;q22), del(16)(q22) and t(16;16)(p13;q22), have been reported mostly in acute myelomonocytic leukaemia (AML), (FAB M4-Eo), and some in CML-BC and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. Most of the cases showed increase of myelomonocytic components and abnormal eosinophils with dysplastic granules in the bone marrow (BM). However, our case was diagnosed as lymphoid BC without increase of myelomonocytic components, although some abnormal eosinophilia was seen. To date, lymphoid BC of CML having inv(16)(p13;q22) abnormality has not been reported. The case presented here could be a clue to understand the pathophysiology of inv(16)(p13;q22) leukaemia.
