Routine cytogenetic studies were done in 174 consecutive patients with preleukemic or myelodysplastic syndromes (PL/MDS): 5 had the 5q - syndrome, 2 had refractory cytopenia, 43 had refractory anemia, 38 had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, 69 had refractory anemia with excess blasts, 6 had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transition, and 11 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Successful chromosome studies were accomplished in 167 patients (96%); 64 (37%) had a chromosomally abnormal clone. Abnormal clones were most common among patients who had refractory anemia with excess blasts (45%), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transition (60%), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (45%); they were least common among patients with refractory anemia (32%) and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (21%). The two patients with refractory cytopenia had normal cytogenetic results. Each patient with the 5q - syndrome had a 5q-chromosome, as this is a prerequisite for the diagnosis. The two most common structural abnormalities were deletion of part of a chromosome 5 long arm (17 patients) and deletion of part of a chromosome 20 long arm (8 patients). Nonspecific structural abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 3, 6, and 17 were also common. The most common numeric abnormalities were monosomy 5 (7 patients), monosomy 7 (4 patients), loss of the Y chromosome (9 patients), and trisomy 8 (20 patients). No chromosome abnormalities were specifically associated with any PL/MDS classification.
