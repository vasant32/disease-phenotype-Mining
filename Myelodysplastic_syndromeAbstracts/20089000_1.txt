Complex chromosomal aberrations (CCA) can be detected in a substantial proportion of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which are associated with very poor prognosis. Conventional cytogenetics (CC) cannot accurately define the specific alterations in CCA. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) allows the comprehensive identification of CCA. In this study, M-FISH was used in 16 patients with de novo MDS and 22 with AML with CCA detected by R-banding CC, and revealed 206 aberrations involved all 24 chromosomes, including 73 numerical chromosomal abnormalities and 133 structural abnormalities. The chromosomes most often involved were, by decreasing incidence, 5, 17, 8, 11, 7 and 21 in 57.9%, 55.3%, 44.7%, 36.8%, 34.2% and 34.2% of the cases, respectively. There were 98 unbalanced translocations, which were the most frequently observed aberrations in our study. Derivative chromosome 5 and 8 were implicated most often. The other derivatives were der(11), der(12), der(7), der(14), der(15) and der(17). Fourteen balanced translocations were detected in our series, and the most frequent reciprocal translocations was t(8;21). Fifty-five monosomies, 15 partial deletions, and 18 trisomies were found in all patients. The most frequently observed were -5/5q-, -17/17q-, -7, -18, -21, -19, and trisomy of chromosome 8 and 6. There were some abnormalities that have not been previously described, including two complex t(8;21) and seven unbalanced translocations. M-FISH could refine CCA, find or correct the missed or misidentified aberrations by CC analysis. Our findings confirmed that M-FISH was a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool to characterize complex karyotypes in MDS and AML.
