The immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody profiles of 104 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), classified according to the FAB criteria, were analysed. Eight patients, four with coexistent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, three with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and one with a lymphoplasmacytoma, were excluded from the final analysis of immunoglobulin levels. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis revealed the presence of monoclonal gammopathy in 12 patients (12.5%). Of the remaining 84 patients, a polyclonal rise in serum immunoglobulins was present in 27 (32%) while a further 16 (19%) had low immunoglobulin levels. The direct antiglobulin test was positive in eight out of 98 patients tested (8.1%), and organ and non-organ specific autoantibodies were present in 15 out of 67 patients tested (22.3%). Two patients had associated pernicious anaemia (PA), two hypothyroidism, and one PA with hypothyroidism. Three patients had sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. These results demonstrate that there is a high incidence of immunological abnormalities in MDS.
