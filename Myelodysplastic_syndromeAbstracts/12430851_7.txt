Patients with advanced hematological malignancies ineligible for conventional myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to advanced age or medical contraindications were enrolled in multi-center study to investigate the safety and efficacy of nonmyeloablative HSCT using a 2 Gy total body irradi ation (TBI)-based regimen. A total of 192 patients (median age 55) were treated with HLA-matched sibling peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and 63 patients (median age 53) received a 10 of 10 HLA-antigen matched unrelated donor (URD) HSCT (PBSC graft, n = 48; marrow graft, n = 15). Diagnoses included multiple myeloma (n = 61), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 55), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 31), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 31), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 28), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 24), Hodgkin Disease (n = 14). The conditioning regimen was fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d x 3 days and 2 Gy TBI. Ninety-five related HSCT patients received 2 Gy TBI without fludarabine. Postgrafting immunosuppression was combined mycophenolate mofetil an cyclosporine. Transplants were well tolerated with a median of 0 days of hospitalization in the first 60 days for eligible patients. For related HSCT recipients, median follow-up was 289 (100-1,188) days. Nonfatal graft rejection occurred in 6.8%. Of those with sustained engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 49% (33% grade II, 11% grade III, 5% grade IV). Day-100 non-relapse mortality was 6%. Overall, 59% (114/192) of patients were alive. The relapse/disease progression mortality was 18%, and non-relapse mortality was 22%. The projecte 2-year survival and progression-free survival were 50% and 40%. For the URD HSCT recipients, median follow-up was 190 (100-468) days. Graft rejection occurred in 27% (17/63) of patients, mostly in recipients of marrow grafts (9/15). Acute GVHD occurred in 63% (50% grade II, 13% grade III) of 46 engrafted patients. Chronic GVHD requiring therapy occurred in 50% of patients. Of the 63 URD HSCT patients, 54% were alive, 37% in CR, 3% PR, and 14% with disease progression or relapse. Related and unrelated nonmyeloablative HSCT is feasible and potentially curative in patients with advanced hematological malignancies who have no other treatment options.
