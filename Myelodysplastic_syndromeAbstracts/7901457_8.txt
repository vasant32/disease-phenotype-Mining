P glycoprotein, the product of multidrug resistance (mdr1) gene, is frequently expressed in advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with an excess of bone marrow blasts and could explain their frequent resistance to chemotherapy. P53 gene mutations are also found in 10 to 15% of advanced MDS. Because it has recently been suggested that normal p53 suppressed, but that mutated p53 activated, the mdr1 gene promoter, we tried to correlate p53 mutations and P glycoprotein expression in 34 patients with MDS and an excess of bone marrow blasts (> 5%). P glycoprotein expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry using JSB1 monoclonal antibody and was found positive in 13 out of the 34 patients. p53 mutations were detected both by immunocytochemistry using three different monoclonal antibodies and by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the P53 gene. Both methods detected a point mutation in 5 out of the 34 patients. Only one out of the 5 patients with a p53 mutation expressed P glycoprotein, as compared to 12 out of the 29 patients without p53 mutations. This suggested the mutant and normal p53 are not major determinants of the regulation of mdr1 expression in vivo, at least in MDS.
