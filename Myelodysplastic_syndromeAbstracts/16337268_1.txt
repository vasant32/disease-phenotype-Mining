The prevalence of subtypes of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was determined in a prospective series of 176 patients presenting at 28 Shanghai hospitals. Diagnosis was established in a single laboratory, analyzing morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic data, using the World Health Organization (WHO) revised classification and directly compared to the French American British (FAB) criteria. The median age at diagnosis for all cases was 53 years. There was a striking increase in the prevalence of RCMD in younger patients relative to other subtypes (WHO). The overall frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was 26.5% (WHO) and 31% (FAB). The most frequently encountered lesions were trisomy 8, del(20)q, del(7q), and del(5q). These results are consistent with previously reported age-dependent differences in MDS and a decreased frequency of del(5q) abnormalities between China and the West. These results also indicate that multilineage dysplasia is a prominent feature in MDS developing in younger individuals in Shanghai and suggest distinguishing between RCMD and RA may be important in the design of studies to further understand regional differences in subtype prevalence and to elucidate the pathogenesis of this complex and multifactorial disease.
