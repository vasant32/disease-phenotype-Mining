A 74-year-old male patient with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with an ulcerative skin lesion on his left lower leg. Recent blood and bone marrow counts indicated a transformation of MDS into an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Histopathological examination of biopsies of the lesion revealed a cutaneous localization of AML, a so-called 'chloroma' (granulocytic or myeloid sarcoma).
