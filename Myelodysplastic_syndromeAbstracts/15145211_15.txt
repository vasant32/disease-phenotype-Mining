 OBJECTIVE: The treatment options for patients with aplastic anemia who do not respond to conventional immunosuppression are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate high-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory severe aplastic anemia (SAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated 17 SAA patients with high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days) who previously did not respond to one or more courses of immunosuppressive therapy. Median age was 31 years (range 6-58); median disease duration was 14 months (range 6-58), and 8 patients met criteria for very severe aplastic anemia (absolute neutrophil count <0.2 x 10(9)/L) at the time of treatment. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 29 months, 10 patients (59%) are alive. Nine patients (53%) achieved a drug-free remission after high-dose cyclophosphamide; 4 patients achieved a complete remission and 5 patients currently meet criteria for a partial remission but continue to improve. One nonresponder to high-dose cyclophosphamide developed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; another nonresponder developed a myelodysplastic syndrome. In responding patients, median time to 500 neutrophils was 54 days (range 35-119), median time to the last platelet transfusion was 99 days (range 51-751), and median time to the last red cell transfusion was 125 days (range 63-796). CONCLUSION: High-dose cyclophosphamide shows promise for salvaging patients with refractory SAA.
