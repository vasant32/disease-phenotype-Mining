We studied myelodysplastic syndrome-associated inhibitory activity (MDS-IA), which inhibited colony formation in vitro of normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM). When adherent marrow cells were incubated with fetal calf serum for 21-24 d, monocyte-derived lipid containing huge macrophages (MDLM) developed. MDLM from MDS marrow (MDS-MDLMs) and their conditioned medium (MDLM-CM) consistently suppressed the growth of normal CFU-GM colony formation. MDS-IA was active on CFU-GM during the S-phase and relatively resistant to heating. Monoclonal antibody against H subunit (acidic) ferritin and polyclonal antibody against placental ferritin neutralized the inhibitory activity of MDS-MDLMs. In addition, cell lysates of MDS-MDLMs reacted to both monoclonal anti-H subunit ferritin and polyclonal anti-placental ferritin in Western blotting analysis, indicating that the inhibitory activity was predominantly acidic isoferritin. On the other hand, MDLMs obtained from normal bone marrow had a CFU-GM enhancing activity. These results suggest that MDS-MDLMs may be responsible for the suppression of granulopoiesis in patients with MDS and that the suppression may be mediated by soluble factors, notably H subunit isoferritin.
