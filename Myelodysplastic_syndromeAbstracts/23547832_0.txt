Abstract In 1976 the French-American-British leukemia working group (FAB) proposed the first definitions of patients with MDS, namely RAEB and CMML. Subsequent publications resulted in additional subgroups that had prognostic significance. The incorporation of the subgroupings by the W.H.O. and additional fine tuning of the degrees of morphologic dysplasia and the % of blasts has enhanced the classification. Several prognostic scoring systems have added degrees of cytopenia, cytogenetic aberrations and molecular genetic mutations that allow care providers to subdivide cases into lower, intermediate and higher grade categories.
