The safety and efficacy of recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alpha) were investigated in anemic patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) whose hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was less than 10g/dl. Epoetin alpha was given subcutaneously daily at a dose of 3,000IU/body for two weeks and the dosage was increased to 6,000IU, 12,000IU, and 24,000IU at two week interval when the increment of Hb was insufficient. Patients in whom the Hb concentration increased by more than 1g/dl or whose blood transfusion requirement reduced to below 50% were considered to be cases of effective treatment. The overall rate of effectiveness was 20.6% (7/34). Response to epoetin alpha treatment was better in patients with refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). The high dose epoetin alpha (12,000-24,000IU/body/day) was required for the patients to respond. These results suggest that the high dose subcutaneous epoetin alpha treatment is effective for the anemia associated with MDS in terms of increasing Hb concentration and reducing blood transfusion.
