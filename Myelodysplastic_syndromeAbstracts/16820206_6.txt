Thrombocytosis is not a frequent event in myelodysplasia (MDS) and is observed mainly in 5q- syndrome and MDS/myeloproliferative (MPD) overlap syndromes. The pathogenetic mechanism of thrombocytosis in 5q- has not been fully elucidated to-date. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor which seems to be effective in MDS. We present here the first case in the literature with MDS/MPD syndrome, sole 5q- anomaly and thrombocytosis in which bortezomib administration normalized platelet count, produced a major erythroid response, and reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha while increased levels of IL-4 in the bone marrow plasma. The study of such cases will reveal the exact role of bortezomib in the management of MDS/MPD.
