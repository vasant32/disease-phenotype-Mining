 BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in approximately 30% of patients. Identification of risk factors for progression to AML and overall survival (OS) would help guide treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated prognostic factors for progression to AML and survival in 163 patients with MDS treated with decitabine 15 mg/m(2) over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks (n = 74) or 20 mg/m(2) over 1 hour daily for 5 days every 4 weeks (n = 89). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of pooled baseline data revealed that only study effect was associated with progression to AML. A hemoglobin value at least 10 g/dL, platelet count at least 50 × 10(3)/μL, and lack of chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities were associated with longer OS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with certain prognostic factors should be considered for other interventions in addition to decitabine treatment.
