The clinical and cytogenetic data of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB) and trisomy 13 as the sole abnormality are presented. This appears to be only the second report of such a patient. The presence of trisomy 13 is confirmed by in situ hybridization using an alphoid repeat probe L1.26, which is specific for the centromeres of both chromosomes 13 and 21.
