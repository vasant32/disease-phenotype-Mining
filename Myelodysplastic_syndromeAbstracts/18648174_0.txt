A 43-year-old woman presented with a persistent high fever of 39 degrees C and edematous erythema accompanied by pustules on the face, trunk and extremities. Conjunctivitis and nodules were also observed in the right eye. On the basis of the clinical symptoms and histopathological findings. Sweet's syndrome was diagnosed. Eruptions quickly progressed to extensive necrosis and ulcers, mimicking clinical features of pyoderma gangrenosum. A bone marrow biopsy indicated myelodysplastic syndrome. Oral administration of 50 mg/day of prednisolone induced epithelialization of ulcers, with remaining scarring and pigmentation. Six months later, myelodysplastic syndrome had progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia.
