AIM: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) serum levels may increase due to intensive conditioning regimes with high-dose-chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) before stem cell transplantation. This increases the risk for developing acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) after stem cell transplantation. In this prospective study we investigated the influence of radioimmunotherapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb on changes on TNF-alpha serum levels. PATIENTS, METHODS: In 18 patients we measured TNF-alpha before and up to 96 hours after radioimmunotherapy, in 2 patients in addition following TBI, in 9 patients also following chemotherapy. For measuring TNF-alpha we used an automated immunochemiluminescence assay (Immulite 1000 DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim). The mean follow up period to record incidence of aGVHD was 100 days after stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Compared to the basal levels before, the levels of TNF-alpha after conditioning with 188Re-CD-66-mAb did not increase significantly and remained in the physiological range. In contrast, these initial physiological cytokine levels increased and became pathological following 48 h after total body irradiation (13.2+/-6.6 pg/ml) and chemotherapy (10.8+/-15.7 pg/ml). In our study we found a low incidence of aGvHD (22.2%, n=4/18). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that additional conditioning therapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb does not increase proinflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-alpha. This finding may indicate that additive radioimmunotherapy may not be a significant factor for increasing the rate of conditioning-associated aGvHD.
