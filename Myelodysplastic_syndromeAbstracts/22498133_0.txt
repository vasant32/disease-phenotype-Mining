Malakoplakia is a protean systemic chronic granulomatous disease that usually targets the genito-urinary system and most particularly the bladder. Only in rare occasions do the kidneys get involved. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a heterogeneous clonal haematopoietic disorder characterised by either a hyper- or hypocellular bone marrow dysmyelopoiesis and peripheral blood pancytopenia. The synchronous association of these two unrelated disorders has never been reported. We report a 62-year-old woman who initially developed vague, relapsing gastrointestinal symptoms synchronous with renal malakoplakia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
