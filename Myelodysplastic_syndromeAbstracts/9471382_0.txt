The peripheral blood from 30 patients presenting with preleukosis states was studied. Both quantitative and qualitative indices of blood and bone marrow were determined. It has been ascertained that the following signs should be taken in consideration where the diagnosis is "preleukosis": anemia presenting with qualitative changes in erythron, neutrophylopenia presenting with a shift to the left, thrombocytopenia, nuclear anomalies of neutrophylocytes and lymphocytes (pelgeroides, fragmentation, pyknosis, Rider's nuclei).
