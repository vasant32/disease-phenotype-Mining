Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is widely used for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Here we present our long-term experience with RIC regimen consisting of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day on days -10 to -5), busulfan (4mg/kg/day on days -6 and -5) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius, 10 mg/kg/day on days -4 to -1) (Flu-Bu-ATG) in a cohort of 71 patients with various hematological malignancies including chronic myeloid leukemia (24 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (19 patients), lymphoma (20 patients), multiple myeloma (3 patients), myelodysplastic syndrome (3 patients), and myelofibrosis (2 patients). The median age was 50 years. The overall response rate was 87%, including 83% CR and 4% PR. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 35% and 52% and the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 1 year and 4 years was 8% and 14%. With the median follow-up of 55.0 months, the 2- and 4-year event-free survival (EFS) was 49.0% and 40.3%, and the overall survival (OS) was 73.2% and 62.6%, respectively. Gender, age at SCT, type of donor, disease status at SCT, previous autologous transplantation, and complete chimerism by day +100 did not significantly influence EFS and OS. In a multivariate analysis, no presence of chronic GVHD (p=0.029, HR: 2.5),and diagnosis other than CML (p=0.018, HR: 4.6), and CD34+ dose < 5x106/kg (p=0.010, HR: 2.8) were significant predictors of poor OS. Flu-Bu-ATG protocol is a RIC regimen that combines effective disease control with low non-relapse mortality and acceptable toxicity profile.
