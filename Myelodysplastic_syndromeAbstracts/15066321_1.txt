Abnormalities in the long arm of chromosome 7 are a frequent chromosomal aberration in myeloid disorders. Most studies have focused on the analysis of del(7q), demonstrating the presence of several minimal deleted regions in 7q22 approximately q31. By contrast, few studies in myeloid disorders have been devoted to the analysis of translocations, either balanced or unbalanced, involving 7q. In this study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize the 7q31.3 approximately q34 region (markers D7S480-D7S2227) in patients with deletion or translocation of 7q. A total of 910 cases of myeloid disorders were studied by conventional cytogenetics. Fifty-eight (6%) patients had structural aberrations of 7q. FISH studies were carried out in the 27 patients with involvement of 7q31 approximately q34: 14 cases had an acute myelogenous leukemia and 13 cases had a myelodysplastic syndrome. FISH analysis revealed the existence of high complexity in the 7q31.3 approximately q34 region in patients with unbalanced translocations. No breakpoints in 7q31.3 approximately q34 were found in the cases with deletion or balanced translocation. Nevertheless, studies of unbalanced translocations showed several breakpoints in markers D7S480-D7S2227, which delineate a commonly altered region. The complexity of 7q rearrangements suggests that a synergy of different genetic factors, rather than the alteration of a single tumor suppressor gene, could be involved in the pathogenesis of del(7q) in myeloid disorders.
