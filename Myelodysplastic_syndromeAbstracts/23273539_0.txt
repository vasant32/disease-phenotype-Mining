Given evidence for the role of Src family kinases, especially Lyn kinase, in myeloblast proliferation and the in vitro inhibitory activity of dasatinib on Src and Lyn, we conducted a phase II study to assess overall response to 100mg/day dasatinib in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia arising from MDS and who had failed prior treatment with azanucleoside analogs. Among 18 patients treated, 3 responded, 4 had stable disease, and 10 experienced disease progression. Toxicities were limited and consistent with previous reports. Dasatinib appears to be safe but with limited efficacy.
