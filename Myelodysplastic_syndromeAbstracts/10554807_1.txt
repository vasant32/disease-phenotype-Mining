The nuclear DNA content, defined as DNA index (DI) in blasts/promyelocytes (bla/pro), were determined on Feulgen-stained bone marrow smears from 39 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and eight control subjects by the use of image cytometry (ICM). The DI in patients was compared to that of corresponding normal cell types, and to cytogenetic data available in 32/39 patients. The mean DI in bla/pro of patients with MDS was significantly (P < 0.01) lower compared to corresponding cell types in control subjects. By ICM, a DNA aneuploidy in bla/pro was found in 67% of the MDS patients, and 59% expressed DNA hypodiploidy. By cytogenetics, an abnormal karyotype was found in 31%, and 6/9 MDS patients with a 'hypodiploid' abnormal karyotype showed DNA hypodiploidy. Of patients with a normal karyotype (69%), seven (32%) showed a normal, 12 (55%) a lower, and three (14%) a higher DI compared to controls. No difference between groups of MDS patients was found. DNA hypodiploidy is suggested to be a common feature in MDS without a relationship to cytogenetics.
