To evaluate the addition of a third drug to standard induction chemotherapy in patients with MDS-AML, 23 patients (males/females 13/10, median age 54.3 years, range 24-74 years, median MDS duration 9.8 months, range 2-39 months) who received a standard 2-drugs induction were compared with 23 patients (males/females 11/12, median age 45.6 months, range 21-60 years, median MDS duration 8.3 months, range 2-29 months) who received an intensified 3-drugs induction with etoposide. CR rate, median CR duration and median OS were similar in both groups (48% vs 56%, 4.8 vs 5.9 months, 6.5 vs 7.0 months respectively). Among responding patients, all but one, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, relapsed. In conclusion, addition of a third drug (etoposide) does not seem to significantly improve the poor prognosis of MDS-AML patients.
