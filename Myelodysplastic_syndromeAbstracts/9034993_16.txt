OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and laboratory features and outcome of patients with remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE). METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of patients with RS3PE fulfilling the following criteria: (1) bilateral pitting edema of both hands, (2) sudden onset of polyarthritis, (3) age > 50 years, (4) seronegative for rheumatoid factor (RF). RESULTS: 27 patients with RS3PE were included, mean age 71.7 years (58-92), 18 men (66.6%) and 9 women (33.3%). Relevant history was noted in 2 patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. Main clinical features were polyarthritis and edema of both hands. Polyarthritis involved metacarpophalangeal joints in 22 patients (81.5%), proximal interphalangeal joints in 19 (70.4%), wrists in 15 (55.5%), shoulders in 13 (48%), elbows in 3 (11.1%), knees in 9 (33.3%), and ankles in 7 (25.9%). All patients were RF negative. Antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer in 8 patients. Erosions were present in one patient. Two patients developed T lymphoma and one myelodysplastic syndrome. CONCLUSION: RS3PE is a heterogeneous syndrome the clinical history, presence of erosions, and evolution to hematological diseases in our patients suggest that RS3PE may not be a distinct clinical entity.
