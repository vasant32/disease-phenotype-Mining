Loss of certain red blood cell antigens has been described in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). This paper describes the loss of blood group A antigen in a patient with AML. The acute leukemia in this patient was preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome for several months. At the time of diagnosis the patient's red cells showed the 0 Rh(D)+ phenotype. After induction of complete remission with two courses of Daunorubicin, Cytosin-arabinosid, and Etoposid his blood group reverted to A2. Serological studies including saliva analysis revealed that the original blood group was very likely A.
