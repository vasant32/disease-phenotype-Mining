Deletions of chromosome 20q are associated with myeloid malignancies and have been previously shown to arise in a multipotent progenitor of both myeloid and B cells. However, B-cell differentiation from the abnormal progenitor was impaired. The CD40 antigen is a surface glycoprotein which is expressed in B cells and haemopoietic stem cells and is important for B-cell growth and development. Following the recent mapping of CD40 to chromosome 20q we sought to determine its position relative to 20q deletions. Analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying 20q deletions placed CD40 within a 19-21 cM interval which is almost coincidental with the common deleted region defined by previous analysis of patient samples. Our results raise the possibility that genetic alteration of this locus may contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders associated with 20q deletions.
