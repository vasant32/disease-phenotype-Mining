The blast cells from nine patients with an overt acute leukaemia following a previous myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies as well as by morphological and cytochemical criteria. By integrating the results obtained with these three approaches the leukaemia in 6 patients was assessed as myeloid-granulocytic and/or monocytic-, in two as mixed- megakaryoblastic/myeloid- and in one as lymphoid. A good correlation between morphology, cytochemistry and immunological markers was observed in 7 out of the 9 cases. In three cases a noteworthy percentage of J5+ cells was detected. The exceptional finding of lymphoid as well as megakaryocytic and myeloid transformations suggests that the target cell for these leukaemias could be a pluripotent stem cell.
