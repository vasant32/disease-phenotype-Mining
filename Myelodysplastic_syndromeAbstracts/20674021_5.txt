We analyzed the role of antibiotic prophylaxis during decitabine treatment for MDS. The primary endpoint was the incidence of febrile episodes. The total number of decitabine cycles given to 28 patients was 131, and febrile episodes occurred in 15 cycles (11.5%). Antibiotic prophylaxis was orally administered in 95 cycles (72.5%). Febrile episodes were significantly less frequent among patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis (7.4%) than in those without prophylaxis (22.2%) (P=0.017). In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of febrile episodes in patients who received decitabine treatment for MDS, especially at earlier cycles and in the presence of severe cytopenia.
