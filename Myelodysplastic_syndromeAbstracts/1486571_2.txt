Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using chromosome 1- and chromosome 7-specific centromeric alpha-satellite probes was performed on the bone marrow (BM) cells of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who had been treated for lymphoma and whose BM karyotype was initially considered to be 46,XY,-7,+der(1)t(1;7)(p11;p11). FISH results suggested the presence of both chromosome 1 and chromosome 7 centromeres in the rearranged chromosome. Thus, the correct karyotype should be written as 46,XY,-7,+der(1;7)(q10;p10).
