 BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic abnormalities have been detected in 40-60% of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Some reports suggest that Asian and Western MDS patients have different cytogenetic features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 168 patients with de novo MDS and compared our results with other Chinese centers to investigate the prevalence and cytogenetic characteristics of MDS in China. RESULTS: In our study, chromosome abnormalities were detected in 40.48% of patients (68/168). Although the median survival time did not differ between younger and older (â‰¥60 years) patients (p = 0.969), survival curves based on International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic groups and WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk groups were significantly different (p < 0.001). Survival differences were observed between patients in the normal karyotype group, sole trisomy 8 group, and poor cytogenetic group according to IPSS (p < 0.001). In agreement with the results from 2 other large Chinese centers, trisomy 8 was the most detected cytogenetic abnormality, with a prevalence of 14.21%. CONCLUSION: Trisomy 8, categorized as intermediate cytogenetic risk group in our study, is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in de novo MDS in China.
