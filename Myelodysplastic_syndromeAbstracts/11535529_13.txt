Because abnormal erythroid differentiation is the most common manifestation of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), it was hypothesized that erythroid gene expression may be used to illustrate myelodysplastic transcription patterns. Ten normal bone marrow aspirates (NBM) were first analyzed using an erythroid-focused cDNA array to define steady-state transcription levels. Proliferation and differentiation gene subsets were identified by statistically significant differences between NBM and erythroleukemia gene expression. Next, cDNAs from 5 separate MDS aspirates were studied: refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and RAEB-T/secondary MDS. A distinct pattern of significantly increased proliferation-associated and reduced differentiation-associated gene activity was established for MDS.
