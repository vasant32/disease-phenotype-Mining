 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA), cytarabine (Ara-C), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CLAG) regimen in refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the multicenter phase II study. METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C2 g/m2, and G-CSF. In the case of partial remission (PR), a second CLAG was administered. Patients in complete remission (CR) received two consolidation courses based on HD Ara-C, mitoxantrone or idarubicine, with or without 2-CdA. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients from 11 centers were registered; 50 primary resistant and eight early relapsed (CR1 < 6 months). CR was achieved in 29 (50%) patients, 19 (33%) were refractory, and 10 (17%) died early. Forty of 50 primary resistant patients received daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C as the first-line induction therapy (DA-7), 10 received additional 2-CdA (DAC-7). The CR rates after CLAG were 58% and 10%, respectively in each group (P = 0.015). Five of six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML achieved CR. Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The overall survival (OS, 1 yr) for the 58 patients as a whole, and the 29 patients in CR were 42% and 65%, respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS, 1 yr) was 29%. Only first-line induction treatment with DA-7 significantly influenced the probability of CR after CLAG. None of the analyzed factors significantly influenced DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: CLAG regimen has significant anti-leukemic activity and an acceptable toxicity in refractory AML. The addition of 2-CdA to the first-line induction treatment may worsen the results of salvage with CLAG. The high CR rate in patients with MDS preceding AML deserves further observation.
