Leukocyte-derived inhibitory activity inhibiting the entry of normal progenitor cells of granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) into the S-phase of a cell cycle was investigated in 16 patients with different forms of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The presence of this inhibitory activity was analysed in medium conditioned with low-density cells obtained from peripheral blood of MDS patients. The inhibition rate was measured by 3H-thymidine suicide technique with subsequent cultivation of pretreated cells in semisolid agar medium. Low-density cells from MDS patients of various types were studied: from the twelve patients with refractory anaemia (RA or RAS) only three were positive, one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) was negative while one patient with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and two patients with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) were positive with respect of the described test. In two patients with RA, who underwent a long-term investigation, the production of leukocyte-derived inhibitory activity preceded the development of disease into RAEB or RAEB-T. In five positive cases, supernatants were incubated with antiserum against human placental ferritin; with one exception, the inhibitory activity was neutralized.
