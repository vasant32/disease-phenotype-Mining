 OBJECTIVE: To assess the applicability of WHO classification on a cohort of Pakistani myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, and determine their epidemiological and clinico-pathological features. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Haematology Department, Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, from April 2004 to March 2006. METHODOLOGY: Forty six patients of primary MDS diagnosed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were included in the study by nonprobability purposive sampling. The cohort was classified accordingly and the epidemiological, clinical and haematological parametres were assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data. RESULTS: Forty six patients (28 males and 18 females) of primary MDS were included in the study. The mean age was 46.21 years. According to the WHO classification, 12 cases of refractory anaemia, 24 cases of refractory cytopenia with multi lineage dysplasia, 1 case of refractory cytopenia with multi lineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts, 3 cases of MDS unclassified and 3 cases each of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts I and II were diagnosed. Symptomatic anaemia was seen in 37 cases and pancytopenia was documented in 33 cases. Dyserythropoiesis affected 41 cases. Grade III reticulosis was seen in 7 cases. ALIP was present in 13 cases. CONCLUSION: MDS presented at a young age. Refractory cytopenia with multi lineage dysplasia was the dominant disease category. Further studies are suggested for identifying the cytogenetic abnormalities and del 5q- category.
