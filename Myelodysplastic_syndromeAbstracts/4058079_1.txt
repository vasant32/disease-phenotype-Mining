Eight patients with inaspiratable bone marrows due to significant degrees of fibrosis were treated with high dose cytosine arabinoside because of either documented or suspected coexistent acute leukemia. The peripheral blood counts returned to normal in 7 patients. Remissions were short lived and bone marrow abnormalities persisted suggesting that consolidation therapy should be administered to these patients as soon as their peripheral blood counts are normalized.
