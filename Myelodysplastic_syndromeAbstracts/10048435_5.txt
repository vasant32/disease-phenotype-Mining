Although an increased risk of hematologic malignancies in children with Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is well established, whether adults with NF-1 have an increased risk of such malignancies is unclear. We currently describe two adult patients with NF-1 who rapidly developed secondary myelodysplastic syndromes with abnormalities of chromosome 7 following chemotherapy for AML. We propose that adults with NF-1 also have abnormalities of hematologic progenitor cells.
