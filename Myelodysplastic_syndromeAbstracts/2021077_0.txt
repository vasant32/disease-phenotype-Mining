The authors made radioisotope examinations of the erythrokinetics in 21 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome: refractory anaemia and sideroblastic anaemia. He investigated the importance of changes of several conventional erythrokinetic parameters as well as the turnover of transferrin molecules which is an indicator of erythropoietic activity independent on sideraemia. The author presents ferrokinetic and erythrokinetic findings associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, as described in the literature. Sideroblastic anaemia produces a typical picture during examination of the erythrokinetics, quite different from other sub-types of the disease in refractory anaemia the changes of parameters are very variable.
