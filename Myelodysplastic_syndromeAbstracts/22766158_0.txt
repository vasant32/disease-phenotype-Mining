Over the last decade, physicians and researchers have increasingly focused their interest in myelodysplastic syndromes. With the general ageing population, these diseases have become more common. Several clinical and fundamental studies have also permitted a better understanding of those disorders and to propose new therapeutic strategies. Large scale genomic analyses have allowed identifying new genes involved in the pathophysiology of this diseases. In the next future, classification of myelodysplastic syndromes will include a cartography of different molecular markers at diagnosis that could help in treatment decision making, as it is increasingly the case in acute myeloid leukemia.
