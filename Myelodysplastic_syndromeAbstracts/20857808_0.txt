Haemosiderosis bulbi is a degenerative condition of the eye bulb caused by the toxic effects of an intracellular accumulation of haemosiderin. Haemosiderin is a product of the decomposition of haemoglobin. The most common and severe damage takes place in the epithelial cells of the eye tissues. Haemosiderosis bulbi is a complication of the long existing haemophthalmus, the intravitreal bleeding, which is neither spontaneously resorbed nor operatively removed. The condition is characterized by the loss of light perception and the reddish colour of the intrabulbar tissues. The cause of the haemophthalmus in our patient is protracted anaemia due to pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS RAEB-1).
