In a young female patient presenting with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a unique clone involving six structural chromosome rearrangements was identified using G-banding and molecular cytogenetic techniques. Fifty GTG-banded metaphases from bone marrow were initially analyzed and all metaphases contained all of the six structural chromosome rearrangements. To further define the GTG-banded karyotype, a series of fluorescence in situ hybridization and primed in situ labeling experiments were performed and the karyotype was then characterized as: 46,XX,r(5)(p13q13),der(20)t(5;20),dup(11)(p11.2p15), r(11)(p15q25),del(13)(q14),idic(22)(p11). The patient quickly progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia three months after the diagnosis and died of a hemorrhage in the brain parenchyma two months later. In this case, the multiple structural chromosome rearrangements conferred an obvious cellular proliferative advantage and indicated a very poor prognosis. Considering that multiple chromosome abnormalities associated with MDS transformation are often polyclonal, this unique clone involving six structural chromosome rearrangements make our case highly unusual.
