We performed a randomized phase II trial comparing low-dose aclarubicin (LC-ACR) with very low-dose cytosine arabinoside (VLD-AC) in 39 consecutive untreated patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including refractory anemia (RA), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t). Nineteen patients received the VLD-AC therapy; 2 good responses (GR) and 2 partial responses (PR) were obtained in 11 patients with RAEB and RAEB-t, while 2 PR were obtained in 8 RA patients. Eighteen patients received the LD-ACR therapy; 2 GR and 4 PR were obtained in 11 RAEB/RAEB-t patients while 2 PR in 7 RA patients. There was no significant difference in the therapeutic effects and survival between these two groups of patients. These observations suggest that the LD-ACR therapy is effective in some patients with MDS and can be used as an alternative to the low-dose Ara-C therapy.
