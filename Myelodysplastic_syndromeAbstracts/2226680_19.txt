In a dose escalation study we tested the feasibility and tolerance of high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) therapy in four patients with ineffective erythropoiesis due to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Recombinant human EPO was administered i.v. with an initial dose of 50 U/kg body weight (BW) three times per week. The dose was increased by steps of 25 or 50 U/kg bW with intervals of 1-4 weeks up to a maximum dose of 500 U/kg BW three times per week. All patients were treated as outpatients. Pre-study treatment with cyclosporin A and/or Danazol was continued in three patients. In one patient r-HuEPO was discontinued after 20 weeks because of relapse of severe aplastic anemia. No major side effects were observed even at the maximum dose. One patient with PNH showed an increase of hemoglobin from 89 to 139 g/liter that permitted monthly phlebotomies to reduce his iron overload. In one patient with MDS the reticulocyte count increased from 2.5 to 50 x 10(9)/liter, and the transfusion requirement decreased to 2 U every 3-4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks. Two patients did not complete the whole treatment period and showed no rise in reticulocyte count. We conclude that high dose r-HuEPO therapy is feasible in patients with anemia due to MDS or PNH. High-dose r-HuEPO appears to have some effect on anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis in a subgroup of patients. Further studies are needed to identify potential responders and to define the optimal administration of r-HuEPO.
