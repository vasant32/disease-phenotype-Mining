Although aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia have been extensively investigated, little is known about their circulating cytokine patterns. We compared plasma soluble cytokines in 33 aplastic anemia, 57 myelodysplasia patients, and 48 healthy controls. High levels of thrombopoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, with low levels of CD40 ligand, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11 were a signature profile for aplastic anemia. High levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and hepatocyte growth factor were a cytokine signature for myelodysplasia. Despite similar clinical presentations, distinct cytokine profiles were observed between aplastic anemia and hypocellular myelodysplasia. Future studies focusing on cytokines that better discriminate these two entities such as thrombopoietin and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 may be useful tools in clinical practice.
