We characterized the prevalence of hematopoietic and lymphoid disease for 2923 consecutive patients presenting at 29 hospitals from August 2003 to June 2007. Diagnoses were made in our laboratory using WHO criteria based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, FISH and molecular data. A total of 611 subjects (322 males/289 females) were prospectively diagnosed with MDS using WHO (2001) criteria. Update and re-evaluation of cases using MDS (2008) criteria resulted in 649 MDS cases. Using WHO (2008) criteria, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) accounted for 68% of total cases, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 16.3%; refractory anemia (RA), 6.5%; refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 4%; and MDS-unclassifiable (MDS-U), 4.5%. Subjects were administered questionnaires and information on previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents such as benzene (BZ) was obtained. A total of 80/649 (13.2%) were determined to have some BZ exposure. The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in all MDS was 30%, the most common being +8>del(20)q>del(7q)>del(5q), while the analogous frequency in BZ-exposed cases was only 24%. To further investigate the characteristics of MDS associated with BZ, we identified a subset of cases with high BZ exposure. These BZ signal cases were each matched by age and gender to two cases with no known BZ exposure. When contrasting BZ signal cases vs matched cases with no BZ exposure, we found a high odds ratio (OR) for the WHO subtype MDS-U (OR=11.1), followed by RAEB and RCUD (OR=1), RA (OR=0.7) and RCMD (OR=0.6). Multilineage dysplasia with abnormal eosinophils (MDS-Eo) was strongly associated with BZ exposure, whereas the relative risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was reduced for high BZ-exposed cases (OR=0.5). These findings are strongly indicative that MDS subtypes are influenced by BZ exposure, and taken together with previous studies, the features of MDS-Eo suggest that altered immune regulation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of MDS following chronic exposure to BZ.
