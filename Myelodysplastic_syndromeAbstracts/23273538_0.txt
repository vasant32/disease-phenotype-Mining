We report health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) among 167 RBC transfusion-dependent patients with IPSS Low-/Intermediate-1-risk del5q31 MDS treated with lenalidomide versus placebo in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial, MDS-004. Mean baseline to 12 week changes in FACT-An Total scores improved following treatment with lenalidomide 5 and 10mg (+5.7 and +5.7, respectively) versus placebo (-2.8) (both p<0.05). Clinically important changes in HRQL from baseline were observed at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 among RBC-TIâ‰¥26 week responders in both treatment groups. Lenalidomide treatment may be effective in improving HRQL outcomes.
