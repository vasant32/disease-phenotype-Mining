Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) administration has been linked to the development of monosomy 7 in severe congenital neutropenia and aplastic anemia. We assessed the effect of pharmacologic doses of GCSF on monosomy 7 cells to determine whether this chromosomal abnormality developed de novo or arose as a result of favored expansion of a preexisting clone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of chromosome 7 was used to identify small populations of aneuploid cells. When bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with monosomy 7 were cultured with 400 ng/ml GCSF, all samples showed significant increases in the proportion of monosomy 7 cells. In contrast, bone marrow from karyotypically normal aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or healthy individuals did not show an increase in monosomy 7 cells in culture. In bone marrow CD34 cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and monosomy 7, GCSF receptor (GCSFR) protein was increased. Although no mutation was found in genomic GCSFR DNA, CD34 cells showed increased expression of the GCSFR class IV mRNA isoform, which is defective in signaling cellular differentiation. GCSFR signal transduction via the Jak/Stat system was abnormal in monosomy 7 CD34 cells, with increased phosphorylated signal transducer and activation of transcription protein, STAT1-P, and increased STAT5-P relative to STAT3-P. Our results suggest that pharmacologic doses of GCSF increase the proportion of preexisting monosomy 7 cells. The abnormal response of monosomy 7 cells to GCSF would be explained by the expansion of undifferentiated monosomy 7 clones expressing the class IV GCSFR, which is defective in signaling cell maturation.
