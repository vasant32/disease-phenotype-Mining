The contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment in myelodysplastic syndrome is controversially discussed. Therefore, the functional properties of primary mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were analyzed in the presence or absence of lenalidomide. Compared to healthy controls, clonality and growth were reduced across all disease stages. Further, differentiation defects and particular expression of adhesion and cell surface molecules (e.g. CD166, CD29, CD146) were detected. Interestingly, the levels of stromal derived factor 1-alpha (SDF-1α) in patients' cells culture supernatants were almost 2-fold lower (p<0.01) compared to controls and this was paralleled by a reduced induction of migration of CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Cocultures of mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with CD34+ cells from healthy donors resulted in reduced numbers of cobblestone area forming-cells and fewer colony forming units. Exposure of stromal cells from patients and controls to lenalidomide led to a further reduction of SDF-1α secretion and cobblestone area formation, respectively. Moreover, lenalidomide pretreatment of mesenchymal stromal cells from low but not high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome was able to rescue impaired erythroid and myeloid colony formation of early hematopoietic progenitors. In conclusion, our analyses support the notion that the stromal microenvironment is involved in the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome thus representing a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
