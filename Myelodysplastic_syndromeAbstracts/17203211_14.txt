Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been approved for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and it is a promising candidate for the treatment of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, such as relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. The effects of As2O3 on B cells, specifically which do not express Bcl-2, have not been studied. In this study, we have demonstrated that As2O3, at clinically achievable therapeutic concentrations, induces apoptosis in Bcl-2 negative human B cell line Ramos. As2O3-induced apoptosis is associated with reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi), enhanced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria into cytoplasm, activation of caspases, and upregulation of Bax and Bim expression. Exogenous glutathione (GSH) reverses the As2O3-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether, these data indicate that As2O3 induces apoptosis in B cells, regardless of Bcl-2 expression, via the mitochondrial pathway by enhancing oxidative stress.
