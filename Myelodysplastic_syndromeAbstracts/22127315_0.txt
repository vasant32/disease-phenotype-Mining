Do patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) have a poor prognosis independent of other predictive variables such as cytogenetics or molecular determinants? Limited data exist to answer this question in part because t-AML is often considered together with AML following myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the category of secondary AML. This discussion provides some insight, based primarily on two published retrospective reviews of the German cooperative groups, into the question of whether t-AML is an independent adverse variable.
