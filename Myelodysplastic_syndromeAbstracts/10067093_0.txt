Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (Allo-PBSCT) has in recent years become an alternative to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation because it facilitates rapid hematopoietic reconstitution without an increase in the incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We report on a 61-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myelofibrosis who received an allo-PBSCT from his HLA-matched 68-year-old brother. The preparative regimen consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporin A and methotrexate were administered for GVHD prophylaxis. The donor was treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously for 4 consecutive days. A preparation of 4.04 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight was collected in a single apheresis and infused immediately. Engraftment times to a neutrophil count greater than 500/microliter and platelet count greater than 2.0 x 10(4)/microliter were 15 days each. Acute GVHD of grade II developed, but was resolved with methylprednisolone. However, the patient died of thrombotic microangiopathy 97 days after his allo-PBSCT. Administration of G-CSF and apheresis in the donor were feasible and well tolerated. Allo-PBSCT may result in earlier engraftment and be especially beneficial to elderly patients with MDS.
