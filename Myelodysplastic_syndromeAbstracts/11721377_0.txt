OBJECTIVE: To summarize the data of autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) for 49 hematological malignancies patients. METHODS: Forty-nine patients, 18 with acute myeloid leukemia, (AML) 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL), 14 multiple myeloma(MM), 6 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS RAEB-t) received APBSCT were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Comparing to conventional chemotherapy, APBSCT can prolong the patients' disease-free survival(DFS) and overall survival (OS). The 3 and 5-year OS rates were 74.78% and 83.33% for AML/NHL; 38% and 19% for MM; 40% and 0 for ALL, respectively. The time of hematopoietic reconstitution was influenced by G-CSF administration significantly. The mean time of neutrophil recovering to 0.5 x 10(9)/L after APBSCT was +17.7 days in no G-CSF group, and +11.14 days in G-CSF group. Up to now, of the 49 patients, no APBSCT related death occur, 23 have died and 22 of them died of relapse. The most common transplantation related complications were fever, liver dysfunction and hypopotassemia, all of which can be cured by proper treatment. CONCLUSION: APBSCT can be safely performed in hematological malignancies.
