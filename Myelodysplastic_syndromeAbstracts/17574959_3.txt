A retrospective cytogenetic study of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was conducted by the Groupe Francophone de Cytogénétique Hématologique (GFCH) to evaluate the structural abnormalities of chromosome 5 associated with other chromosomal abnormalities, in particular of chromosome 7, in these pathologies. In all, 110 cases of AML/MDS were recruited based on the presence of chromosome 5 abnormalities under conventional cytogenetics and supplemented by a systematic fluorescence in situ hybridization study of chromosomes 5 and 7. The abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) were deletions of various sizes and sometimes cryptic. The 5q abnormalities were associated with translocations in 54% of cases and were simple deletions in 46%. In 68% of cases, 5q deletions were associated with chromosome 7 abnormalities, and 90% of these presented a complex karyotype. Of the 110 patients, 28 had a hematopoietic disorder secondary to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Among 82 patients with de novo AML/MDS, 63 were older than 60 years. Chromosomal abnormalities often associated hypodiploidy and chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities in complex karyotypes, features resembling those of secondary hemopathies. Systematic investigation of the exposure to mutagens and oncogenes is thus essential to specify the factors potentially involved in MDS/AML with 5q abnormalities.
