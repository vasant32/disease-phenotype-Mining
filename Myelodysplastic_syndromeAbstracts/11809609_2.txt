In a 64-year-old man suffering from hypoblastic myelodysplastic syndrome a secondary acute myeloid leukaemia developed. After induction chemotherapy with resulting partial remission he received an allogenic (related) peripheral blood stem cell transplantation conditioned with 2 Gy total body irradiation. After haematopoietic reconstitution chest pain and dyspnoea appeared. Computer tomography revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates which were considered to be suspicious for an invasive pulmonary aspergillosis of the left upper lobe. Respiratory and circulatory insufficiency occurred. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid Aspergillus antigen was detected. In addition, Aspergillus flavus was isolated on Sabouraud-dextrose agar. Ambisome (liposomal encapsulated amphotericin B) was applied in high dosages. On the skin of the sides and the back five livid red stained nodular lesions with haemorrhagic infarctions appeared. Pathohistologically, both in PAS (periodate acid Schiff) and Grocott-Gomori staining conglomerates of septated hyphae were detected in corium and subcutis. In addition, Aspergillus flavus grew from skin tissue. Despite antifungal treatment the patient died from Aspergillus pneumonia and generalized aspergillosis with dissemination to heart, brain, and skin.
