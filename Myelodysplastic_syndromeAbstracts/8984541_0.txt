Recently, different rheumatic manifestations have been reported in association with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The objective of the present report was to know the prevalence and characteristics of joint inflammatory manifestations associated with MDS in our environment. Three cases were found in the review of 55 patients with MDS diagnosed in our institution in the last three years. The three patients had chronic non-erosive polyarthritis, with a poor response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and required intermediate doses of glucocorticoids for its control. The arthritis was present in two patients at blood disease diagnosis. The prevalence of arthritis associated with MDS in our series was 5.4% (95% CI: 1.1% to 15.1%). Articular symptoms may be present before the hematological diagnosis; therefore, MDS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of late onset polyarthritis, particularly when associated with cytopenia. Glucocorticoid therapy at intermediate doses is usually required to control the articular symptoms.
