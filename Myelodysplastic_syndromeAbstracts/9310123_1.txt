Bone marrow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained in 48 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (35 cases) or aplastic anaemia (AA) (13 cases). The lower thoracic and lumbar spine were evaluated on sagittal plane using a 1.5 Tesla superconducting MR unit with a surface coil. Pulse sequence of STIRs (TR 2000 msec, TI 160 msec, TE 20 msec) were applied. Four distinct patterns of signal intensity (SI) on the STIR images were classified as follows: pattern 1, homogeneously low SI; 2, marginally high SI; 3, heterogeneously high SI; 4, homogeneously high SI. In all 13 patients with AA, STIR images initially revealed pattern 1. In 25 of 35 cases with MDS patients, the STIR images were initially classified as pattern 3. The STIR images of 6 AA and 5 MDS patients with a clinical response to treatment showed pattern 2 similar to that of normal marrow distribution. The STIR images of MDS patients showed an abnormal distribution of SI. Significant signal changes in the STIR images can be observed in successive examinations of the patients, thus facilitating follow-up of the disease and treatment. MRI of the bone marrow provides a noninvasive means of grossly examining a large fraction and is a useful technique in patients with aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
