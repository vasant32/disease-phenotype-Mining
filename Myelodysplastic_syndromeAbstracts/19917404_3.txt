To prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) combined with calcineurin inhibitors have been used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Previous studies commonly utilize MMF treatment until day 30 after allo-SCT. However, the feasibility of continuous administration after day 30 has not been well evaluated. We retrospectively assessed the safety and efficacy of extended drug administration. Twenty-five patients ceased MMF at day 30 (group A); whereas, 16 patients (group B) received extended regimens depending on individual risk factors for GVHD. No severe adverse events were observed in either group. Although the cumulative incidence (CI) of grade I to IV GVHD at day 100 was comparable between the 2 groups, the CI of grade II to IV GVHD was less among group B (12.5%) compared with group A (42.3%). Extended MMF administration may be safe and beneficial as preemptive therapy to reduce the development of moderate-to-severe acute GVHD.
