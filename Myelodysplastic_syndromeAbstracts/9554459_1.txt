We report a 46-year-old man suffering from angiocentric lymphoma of the skin. On admission, he had atypical cells rich in basophilic granules in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, in addition to skin eruptions and bone marrow dysplasia. Immediately after diagnosis, the patient was treated with multidrug combination chemotherapy. At first, the chemotherapy markedly relieved the skin eruption and bone marrow dysplasia, and atypical cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood disappeared rapidly. However, the disease gradually became resistant to chemotherapy, resulting in a gradual deterioration of the skin eruption and bone marrow dysplasia, and reappearance of atypical cells. The levels of serum cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-6, and of soluble interleukin-2 receptor correlated well with the disease states. These results suggest that the lymphoma cells directly or indirectly induce the production of these cytokines and that a dysregulated cytokine network, which might be caused by lymphoma cells, induces an increase in atypical cells.
