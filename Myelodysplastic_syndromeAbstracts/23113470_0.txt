This study describes a retrospective analysis on the transplant outcome of 56 consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) according to their response to hypomethylating agents (HMA). While 2-yr disease-free survival (DFS) of patients who transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (n = 12) was 25%, that of the remaining patients with MDS according to response to HMA was 73.1%, 68.1%, 50.0%, and 20.8% in G-COR (group of continuous response, n = 19), G-NoC (group of no change, n = 15), G-LOR (group of loss of response, n = 6), and G-DP (group of disease progression, n = 4), respectively. When dichotomized as G-COR/G-NoC versus G-LOR/G-DP, significantly different 2-yr DFS (71.0% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.004) and relapse (14.1% vs. 46.7%; P = 0.016) were demonstrated. On multivariate analysis, G-LOR/G-DP [hazard ratio (HR), 3.91; P = 0.008] and poor karyotype at transplantation (HR, 2.69; P = 0.017) were the significant predictors for poor DFS, as G-LOR/G-DP was for relapse (HR, 6.28; P = 0.011). DFS was significantly poor in patients with any of the two predictors in all MDS (81.5% vs. 34.9%; P = 0.001) or higher-risk MDS (HrMDS) at the time of HMA (80.7% vs. 29.2%; P = 0.005). G-COR showed a trend of better DFS compared with G-NoC among HrMDS (74.6% vs. 36.5%; P = 0.090). These results implicate the significance of response to HMA on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcomes and support the need for future study to verify the suggested strategy of proceeding to transplantation before LOR or DP, especially for HrMDS.
