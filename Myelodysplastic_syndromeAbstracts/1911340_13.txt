In a phase II study, 12 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and anaemia (nine transfusion-dependent) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) to assess the therapeutic effect on erythropoiesis and on transfusion requirement. Patients with a low risk of developing acute leukaemia were included, i.e. refractory anaemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) and RA with excess blasts (RAEB), providing the percentage of myeloblasts in the bone marrow did not exceed 10%. Recombinant HuEpo treatment was initiated at a dose of 50 units/kg body weight and administered subcutaneously three times weekly. At 3-week intervals the dose was increased with 50 units/kg per injection, until after 15 weeks a maximum dose of 250 units/kg three times weekly was reached. All patients completed the study. Recombinant HuEpo was well tolerated and no serious side effects were seen. There was no evidence of the emergence of a new malignant clone in response to rHuEpo as shown by sequential karyotyping. In none of the patients was an increase in haemoglobin level or a diminished red blood cell transfusion requirement seen. In four out of 10 evaluable sequential bone marrow smears, an increase in erythropoiesis was seen, suggesting stimulation of ineffective red cell production. One of these patients also showed a rise in reticulocyte count. The number of erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-E) in blood and bone marrow was not affected by rHuEpo treatment. Also no change in the number of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in blood and bone marrow was noted. In conclusion, subcutaneous treatment with rHuEpo at dosages up to 250 units/kg body weight (three times weekly) fails to increase the haemoglobin level or to diminish the transfusion requirement in patients with MDS and anaemia. It is unclear whether higher doses of rHuEpo are effective or whether patients with less severe anaemia who are transfusion independent, have a higher likelihood of response.
