Quantitative cytochemistry of components of blood neutrophil azurophilic granules (myeloperoxidase, chloroacetate esterase, beta-glucuronidase, and acid phosphatase) and specific granules (lactoferrin) has been performed by scanning and integrating microdensitometry in 13 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome and 11 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia. Both patient groups showed a reduction of enzyme activity in azurophilic granules, and also of lactoferrin, consistent with abnormal development of neutrophil granules. These cytochemical changes in blood neutrophils are similar to those found in acute myeloid leukaemia, are consistent with a leukaemic maturation defect, and may be of diagnostic value.
