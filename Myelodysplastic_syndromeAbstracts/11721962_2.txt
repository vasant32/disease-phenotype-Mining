Myeloblast-rich samples, required for investigation of myeloid malignancies, can be obtained only during the untreated stage of leukemia. Existing methods for myeloblast enrichment have various prerequisites that limit their application. In this new method, a mixture of peripheral blood (Mixed PB) from an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient and from a healthy control containing 5% myeloblasts was subjected to density gradient centrifugation using a 14.5% metrizamide solution. Both high purity (86.3% +/- 1.5%) and high recovery of viable myeloblasts were achieved. Close to 100-fold blast enrichment, even from Mixed PB containing only 0.15% myeloblasts, was achieved. Similarly, this method highly enriched myeloblasts from unprocessed samples, including marrow cells, from patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chronic myeloid leukemia (purity: 2.7% +/- 2.0% before separation, 56.6% +/- 28.3% after separation) (n = 22). The enriched blasts were suitable for various analyses, eg, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and gene analysis.
