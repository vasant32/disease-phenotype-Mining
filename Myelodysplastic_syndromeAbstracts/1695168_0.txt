The object of this study was to determine whether the "in vitro" parameters of medullary and blood granulopoiesis in patients with MDS, furnish information of either prognostic or diagnostic value. This study covered 94 patients with MDS. All patients were studied at the onset of disease. In order to identify the factors related to patients' survival, Cox Multiple Regression analysis was performed by the BMD P2L program. When analyzing by means of actuarial curves the survival probability of patients with benign development versus those of malignant development (those who developed ANLL), the significance between both groups was p = 0.0001. Different variables of patients included in this study were analyzed and all showed great significances. Fab: p = 0.0022, disease evolution: p = 0.0001 and presence of blastic aggregates: p = 0.0011. Cox's regression analysis revealed that the only predictable survival variable is the presence of blastic colonies and/or clusters. Accordingly, two groups were constructed: favourable and unfavourable. In the favourable group, 40% of the patients belonged to the RA group, while in the unfavourable group, 55% belonged to the RAEB group. This study shows the validity of the elaboration of prognostic groups in MDS according to the presence of blastic colonies and/or clusters in CFUGM medullary and/or peripheral cultures. The "in vitro" myeloid progenitors culture techniques may therefore be advantageously applied in these disorders for formulating a diagnosis and predicting the patient's short term evolution.
