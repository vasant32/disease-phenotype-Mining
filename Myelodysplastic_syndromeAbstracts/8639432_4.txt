A 31-year-old man with refractory anaemia of excess blasts, which had karyotypic abnormalities, received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). At time of relapse, 3 months after BMT, he was treated with donor leucocyte transfusion (DLT). Grade III acute GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) occurred 35 d after DLT which was fully reversed with cyclosporin and prednisolone. His condition was complicated by a herpes zoster infection. 2 months after DLT, neutrophil and platelet count were increased and karyotypic abnormalities disappeared. This observation demonstrates that DLT is an effective treatment for relapse of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after BMT.
