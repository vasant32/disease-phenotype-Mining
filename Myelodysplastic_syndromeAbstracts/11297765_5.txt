Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are the two most frequent aneuploidies found in hematological disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, primed in situ labeling (PRINS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic approaches were used to investigate 54 cases of hematopoietic disorders. Of these cases, there were 22 cases of trisomy 8, 2 cases of tetrasomy 8, 14 cases of monosomy 7, and 16 cases with two copies of both chromosomes 7 and 8. PRINS was carried out in interphase nuclei of bone marrow samples using primers that can specifically detect alpha-satellite DNA sequences of chromosomes 7 and 8. In parallel, using the alpha-satellite probes for chromosomes 7 and 8, FISH was performed for all the cases. PRINS and FISH techniques showed similar specificity and sensitivity. In comparison to FISH, PRINS is more advantageous since it is a faster, easier, and more cost-effective technique. Additionally, for most of the cases, a higher proportion of aneuploidy was detected in metaphases using conventional cytogenetics, as compared to the one found in interphase nuclei identified with PRINS and FISH techniques. In other words, for these cases, the cells with trisomy 8 or monosomy 7, had a distinct proliferative advantage compared to the disomic cell population. Therefore, to better quantify the proportion of aneuploid cells in bone marrow, we recommend to investigate the frequency of aneuploidy in nuclei using PRINS, rather than studying only the dividing cells as detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques.
