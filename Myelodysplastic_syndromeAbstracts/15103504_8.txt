LIGHT is a recently cloned novel cytokine belonging to the TNF family that is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells (iDCs) generated from monocytes isolated from human PBMCs. In these studies, we demonstrate that exogenous soluble LIGHT or soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L) can promote monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation in vitro by the up-regulation of CD86, CD80, CD83, and HLA-DR antigen expression. Immature dendritic cells differentiated from monocytes of MDS patients displayed lower levels of costimulatory and HLA-DR molecules compared with iDCs differentiated from monocytes of normal subjects. However, upon induction of maturation by LIGHT or CD40L, the expression of costimulatory and HLA-DR molecules is comparable between DCs from MDS and normal subjects. Exogenous LIGHT- and CD40L-stimulated mature DCs (mDCs) also displayed increased antigen presentation to autologous T lymphocytes (tetanus toxin) or allogeneic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte reactions. DCs matured by LIGHT showed increased secretion of IL-6, IL-12p75, and TNF-alpha, but not IL-1beta. We conclude that both LIGHT and CD40L are immunoregulating factors that induce monocyte-derived iDCs from MDS patients to undergo maturation resulting in increased antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Monocyte-derived DCs can be stimulated to undergo phenotypic and functional changes with LIGHT that might be applied in the development of a DC-based vaccine for MDS treatment.
