A 54-year-old RhD-negative male with del(20q)-positive myelodysplastic syndrome was transplanted with bone marrow from an HLA-identical RhD-positive sibling donor. Cytogenetic relapse was detected 21 months after stem cell transplantation (SCT), with reappearance of the original del(20q)-positive clone and reversion to recipient RhD-negative blood group. The patient received sequential donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), resulting in mild graft-versus-host disease and pure red cell aplasia. At 2 years post DLI, the patient remains in a stable condition, despite a dominance of recipient-derived erythro- and granulopoiesis originating in del(20q)-carrying progenitor cells. We conclude that reappearance of autologous erythropoiesis, upon relapse after allogeneic SCT, may be predictive of erythropenia after DLI and that re-emerging autologous del(20q)-positive erythropoiesis post DLI can provide a normal peripheral red blood cell count. Furthermore, in patients relapsing after blood-group-mismatched transplantation, a possible reversion to recipient blood group should be considered prior to blood transfusion or DLI.
