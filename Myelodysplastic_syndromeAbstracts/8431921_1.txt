We report a patient diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) who underwent an evolution to a nonlymphocytic acute leukemia (ANLL-M5a). Initial cytogenetic study showed a diploid karyotype; however, when ANLL-M5a was diagnosed, the bone marrow (BM) cells showed a t(12;14)(q13;q32), which to our knowledge has not been described previously in a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
