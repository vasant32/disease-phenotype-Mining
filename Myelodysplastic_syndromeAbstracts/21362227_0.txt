The aim of study was to investigate the relationship of anemia and neutropenia with ultrastructural abnormalities of erythroblasts and young neutrophils in bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Anemia parameters and peripheral neutrophil amount of 74 patients with MDS were measured by automatic hemocyte analyzer. According to Hb value and neutropenia degree, MDS patients were divided into 4 groups: normal, mild, middle and severe anemia or neutropenia. The morbid rate and apoptosis rate of erythroblasts and young neutrophils in bone marrow were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that 68 out of 74 patients were consistent with anemia diagnostic criteria, and 51 out of 68 patients were with neutrocytopenia. TEM showed different abnormal features of erythroblasts and young neutrophils in all patients. The morbid rates of erythroblasts in normal, mild, middle and severe anemia groups were 37 ± 14.7%, 24 ± 9%, 32 ± 16% and 34 ± 21% respectively, while apoptotic rates of erythroblasts in normal, mild, middle and severe anemia groups were 2.25 ± 1.03%, 4.43 ± 2.60%, 8.78 ± 4.04% and 11.67 ± 4.57% respectively. The morbid rate and apoptotic rate of erythroblasts were correlated negatively with Hb and HCT value (p < 0.05). The apoptotic rates of bone marrow young neutrophils in 4 groups with different degree of neutropenia were 6.00 ± 2.67%, 9.50 ± 4.42%, 13.00 ± 3.54% and 17.00 ± 2.39%, which correlated negatively with peripheral neutrophil quantity (p < 0.01). Morbid rates of neutrophils in normal, mild, middle and severe anemia groups were 12.25 ± 16.31%, 13.5 ± 10.01%, 23 ± 8.59% and 51.67 ± 19.67% respectively, which positively correlated with its apoptotic rates (p < 0.01). It is concluded that anemia and neutropenia in patient with MDS are correlated with apoptosis and morbid rate of erythroblasts and young neutrophils in bone marrow, which may result in ineffective hematopoiesis.
