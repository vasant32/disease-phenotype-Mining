We present the case of a 71 year-old man with secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia, who was successfully treated with low dose melphalan plus Epo plus G-CSF. We treated the patient with 2 mg of melphalan once a day orally, G-CSF 5 mg/kg 3 times a week and Epo 10.000 ui subcutaneously 3 times a week until the maximum response was obtained. Complete remission was achieved after 16 weeks of continuous treatment. Treatment-related toxicity was not significant. We recommend the use of low dose melphalan in elderly patients with high risk MDS as a treatment option.
