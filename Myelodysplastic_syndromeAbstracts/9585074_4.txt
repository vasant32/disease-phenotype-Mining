The case history of a 70-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome terminated into acute leukemia in 22 months is presented. The leukemic cells exhibited multifocal acid phosphatase positivity and expressed TdT, CD45, CD34 and HLA-DR but not myeloid, monocytic or megakaryocytic differentiation antigenes. The genotypic analysis revealed clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. These phenotypic and genotypic analyses of the blastic cell population suggest that myelodysplastic syndrome may transform to pure acute lymphoblastic leukemia of B-cell origin.
