We present three patients with hematological malignancies, all neutropenic and febrile despite broadspectrum antibiotics. They all developed a sparse rash with purpuric maculopapules with a violaceous hue centrally. These skin lesions were associated with systemic Candida infections and responded well to antifungal treatment. They appeared to be a short-cut to the diagnosis of systemic Candida infections for both the hematologist and the dermatologist.
