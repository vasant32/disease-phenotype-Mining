A 72-year-old woman developed three consecutive processes that showed characteristics of different neutrophilic dermatoses. First, she developed a picture resembling granuloma faciale, followed by a Sweet's syndrome-like eruption, and then by a superficial pyoderma gangrenosum. She was later diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. This case demonstrates that neutrophilic dermatoses form a spectrum of entities that do not necessarily occur in isolation.
