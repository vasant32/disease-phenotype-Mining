Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome 7 specific alpha satellite DNA probe was used to detect monosomy 7 in interphase and metaphase cells obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Chromosome analysis revealed monosomy 7, either alone or as part of a complex chromosome abnormality, in all cell samples. FISH analyses of 12 marrow samples and a blood sample using a chromosome 7 specific alpha satellite DNA probe revealed a single fluorescence spot in 80.5-97.5% of interphase cells indicating monosomy 7. In contrast, 83.5-92.0% of the same cells had two copies of chromosome 17 as two fluorescent spots were detected using a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite DNA probe used as a positive control. The proportion of interphase cells with monosomy 7 did not correlated with the percentage of metaphase cells with monosomy 7 detected by conventional karyotyping or with the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow.
