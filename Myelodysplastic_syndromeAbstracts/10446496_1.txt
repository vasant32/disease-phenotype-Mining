Three patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and a bleeding tendency due to marked thrombocytopenia of less than 20 x 10(9)/l were admitted to our hospital for further examination. Bone marrow examination revealed megakaryocytic hypoplasia in all three patients. All patients exhibited amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, myelodysplastic syndrome, or bone marrow hypoplasia. 111In-labeled platelet kinetic studies revealed decreased platelet production in all patients. Although serum thrombopoietin (sTPO) levels are usually within the normal level in patients with LC, the sTPO levels of our patients were about 10 times higher than the levels of normal subjects (1.22 +/- 0.37 fmol/ml): 13.34, 16.79, and 10.46 fmol/ml, respectively. These sTPO data supported our findings of decreased megakaryopoiesis. Our findings suggest that examination of sTPO levels is useful in determining the etiology of marked thrombocytopenia in LC patients.
