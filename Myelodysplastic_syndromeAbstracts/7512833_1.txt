A 48-year-old man developed refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. Complete response was achieved by low-dose ara-C therapy, but he relapsed 15 months later, with pancytopenia and 13.0% myeloblasts in normocellular marrow. He was treated unsuccessfully with prednisolone, metenolone, and 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 for 8 weeks. He then developed life-threatening pneumonia and was treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF Filgrastim; 125 micrograms/day s.c.). The pneumonia resolved and, interestingly, he achieved a partial response, with normal blood cell counts and only a few dysmyelopoietic cells in the marrow. However, thrombocytopenia progressed when rhG-CSF administration was tapered. When the dose was increased again, leukemic blasts were found to proliferate. When rhG-CSF was discontinued, blasts rapidly decreased in the peripheral blood. Chromosomal analysis revealed a complex abnormality during the first relapse, a normal 46,XY karyotype during the partial response, and recurrence of the same complex abnormality during leukemic transformation. The stimulation index of marrow mononuclear cells cultured with rhG-CSF increased with disease progression. These findings suggest that rhG-CSF initially stimulated the selective proliferation of normal hemopoietic cells, but the evolution or selection of a leukemic clone responsive to rhG-CSF appears to have occurred subsequently.
