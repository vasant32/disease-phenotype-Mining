An immunohistochemical study was performed on trephine biopsy specimens of bone marrow in 10 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Monoclonal antibodies HIP7 and CDW41 were used against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD41) to determine dysmegakaryopoiesis including its size, proportion of micromegakaryocytes, location and staining characteristics. The results show that the dysmegakaryopoiesis of MDS includes the increased number and high proportion of micromegakaryocytes, the altered architectural distribution and the considerable variation in staining. These may be helpful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MDS.
