A retrospective analysis was performed on 76 consecutive elderly patients with acute leukemia aged 60 years or more (48 men, 28 women). Forty patients were 60-69 years old, 28 were 70-79 years old and 8 were > or = 80 years old. There were 55 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 13 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 8 AML from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS/AML). Patients were treated with the JALSG protocol, CAG regimen, or low-dose Ara-C regimen for AML, and DVP/M-CHOP protocol for ALL. The complete remission (CR) rates were 52.7% (29 of 55) in AML, 61.5% (8 of 13) in ALL, and 0% in MDS/AML. The median CR durations were 226, 85, 0 days, and the median survivals were 204, 177, 99 days, respectively. CR rates were 65.3% for the JALSG protocol, 62.5% for the CAG regimen and 25.0% for low-dose Ara-C regimen. According to age, CR was obtained 62.5% in patients aged 60-69 years and 33.3% in patients over 70 years old. Our results indicated that patients aged 60-69 years should be treated with intensive chemotherapy.
