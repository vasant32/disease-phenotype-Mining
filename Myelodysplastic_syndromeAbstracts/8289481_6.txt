In a randomized phase II study, patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with 10-30% blasts in the bone marrow and hematopoietic failure were treated with low-dose Ara C (2 x 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously (s.c.) days 1-14) and rhGM-CSF (fully glycosylated, Sandoz/Schering-Plough, 2 x 150 micrograms protein/day s.c.) given either following Ara C (days 15-21) or simultaneously (days 8-14) for 1-5 cycles. 108 patients with a median age of 65 years, range 17-80 years and refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB, n = 54), RAEB with transformation (RAEBt, n = 50) or with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 4) were evaluable. Complete remission was achieved in 15 cases (14%), 11 had a partial response (10%), and 16 a minor response (15%). Stable disease was reached in 35 cases (32%). There were 16 cases of toxic death (15%), progression occurred in 15 patients (14%). No differences existed between the two treatment arms with respect to response and duration of response. Prognostic factors for poor response included the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities and a history of previous blood transfusions. Major adverse events during treatment were hemorrhage (55%), infections (54%), and fever associated with GM-CSF administration (40%). The overall response rate ws 39%, median duration was 12.5 months from start of treatment which allowed responding patients to lead good quality life without further therapy. The question whether the combination is indeed superior to LD-Ara C alone is not settled but will be evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial.
