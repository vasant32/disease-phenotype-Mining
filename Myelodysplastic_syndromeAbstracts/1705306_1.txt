The effects of four recombinant hemopoietic growth factors (HGF) and of the impure factor HTB9 on proliferation and maturation of marrow myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitor cells were studied in 22 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In most cases, IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF increased significantly the number of myeloid colonies, the best combination being IL-3 + GM-CSF. A significant increase in the myeloid colony/cluster ratio was also noted, but cytological examination of colony cells showed little maturation. The analysis of myeloid colony surface markers with four monoclonal antibodies (to CD13, CD15, CD33 and CD34) showed minor modifications with an increase of CD13 and CD15 in about one third of cases when compared to control without HGF. Erythroid colonies were obtained in one case with erythropoietin alone, and in 19 cases with the addition of GM-CSF and/or IL-3. In short-term liquid cultures, IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF increased 3H-thymidine incorporation. We conclude that progenitor cells of most MDS are able to proliferate in the presence of HGF, with wide case-to-case variations. However, the pattern of growth remains abnormal when compared to normal marrow. Although the combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF is the most efficient, there is a large overlap in the stimulating effects of all factors studied.
