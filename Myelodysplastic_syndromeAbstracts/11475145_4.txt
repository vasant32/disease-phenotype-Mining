Therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is often restricted to lifelong support with red blood cell units (RBCU). A variety of immune phenomena associated with antibody production have been reported in MDS patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that red cell antibodies are more frequent in patients with MDS compared to other regularly transfused patients. Red cell antibodies were determined in 42 MDS patients, in 28 patients with other hematological disorders, and in a historical group of 129 patients with end-stage renal failure. All of these patients received frequent red cell substitution therapy, at least two RBCU in biweekly intervals. Red cell antibodies were detected in 9 of 42 patients with MDS, in 3 of 28 patients with other hematological disorders, and in 4 of 129 patients with end-stage renal failure. Evidence of red cell antibodies was displayed by 6 of 27 MDS patients treated with prestorage leukocyte-depleted RBCU and 3 of 15 MDS patients transfused with bedside leukocyte-filtered RBCU. Red cell antibodies are frequent in patients with hematological disorders who require repetitive red cell transfusions. The formation of alloantibodies to red cell antigens is as frequent in MDS patients as in other patients with hematological disorders.
