We applied the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) to our series of 118 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to determine its validity, and also used univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the prognostic significance of TP53 configurations. Sixteen patients with the mutation had a strikingly worse prognosis and the multivariate analysis demonstrated that this alteration was the most significant factor. The prognostic comparison between patients with and without the mutation within each IPSS subgroup showed a significant difference in the intermediate subgroups. A combination of clinical manifestations and genetic configurations provided us with more accurate prognostic information in MDS patients.
