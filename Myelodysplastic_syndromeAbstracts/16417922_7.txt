There is an emerging use of flow cytometry to evaluate patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We have studied CD7 and TdT expression in the CD34+ myeloid blast cell population in 55 bone marrow samples of patients with MDS. CD7 and/or TdT were detected in 38 out of 55 patients (69%). CD7 expression was not related to other bad prognosis data but conversely, we found an association between TdT+ CD34 myeloblasts and high-risk MDS patients according to the International Prognostic Scoring System. Therefore, CD7 and TdT may help to establish the diagnosis of MDS and, TdT expression also seems to be a useful marker in distinguishing risk groups.
