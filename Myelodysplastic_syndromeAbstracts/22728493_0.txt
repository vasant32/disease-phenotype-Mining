Splenic abscess is a rare clinical condition with a high mortality rate. Multiple splenic abscesses, rather than a solitary abscess, are present in immunocompromised states including hematological malignancies. As symptoms of splenic abscesses, fever and abdominal pain, are non-specific, timely and adequate use of imaging studies is crucial for early diagnosis. We report the cases of 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple splenic abscesses. Notwithstanding the higher mortality rate of patients with multiple splenic abscesses as compared with those with a solitary splenic abscess, we successfully treated the 2 patients by using antibiotic therapy and fine needle aspiration.
