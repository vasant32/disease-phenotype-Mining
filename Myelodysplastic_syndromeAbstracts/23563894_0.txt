In this case presentation, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) intervention successfully performed on a 76-year-old male patient with severe degenerative aortic stenosis and diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is discussed. This case presentation represents the first case on the treatment of severe aortic stenosis on a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome through the use of the TAVI method and may form an alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who have a known haematological disease. For a successful procedure, the patient must be evaluated in cooperation with the haematology clinic and all necessary precautions regarding bleeding and infection complications of the patient must be taken prior to the procedure.
