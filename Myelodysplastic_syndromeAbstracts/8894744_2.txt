A 42-year-old woman with Crow-Fukase syndrome developed acute myeloid leukemia (M6: FAB classification) following treatment with alkylating agents (a total of 2,500 mg of melphalan and 9,800 mg of cyclophosphamide). Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow showed 49,XX,der(1;7)(q10;p10), +8, +19, +21 in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome with additional chromosomes 8, and 12 and two additional chromosomes 21 in acute leukemia. Because of the risk of therapy-related leukemia, alkylating agents should be used with caution in the treatment of Crow-Fukase syndrome.
