We examined the effects of danazol on in vitro growth of human bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells from 15 normal donors and 5 myelodysplastic patients, and on in vivo hemopoiesis in 30 patients with hypoplastic or myelodysplastic disorders. At concentrations similar to that reported as the plasma level after oral administration, danazol significantly increased CFU-GM colony growth in all normal donors, while the influence on CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-MK and CFU-GEMM colony growth was less evident. The stimulatory effect on CFU-GM was observed even after accessory cell depletion. Np stimulatory effect either in vitro on the growth of all hemopoietic progenitors or in vivo was observed in 15 myelodysplastic patients, while 7 complete and 3 partial hematological responses occurred in 15 patients with hypoplastic disorders. In conclusion, our results suggest that danazol exerts a direct stimulatory activity in vitro at least on CFU-GM, and a hemopoietic stimulatory effect in vivo in hypoplastic but not in myelodysplastic disorders.
