Cytogenetic studies were performed in 140 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at diagnosis. Chromosome 11 anomalies were found in 7 cases (5%); 2 of these patients had refractory anemia (RA), 2 had refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 1 had RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and 2 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) according to the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group criteria. The chromosome 11 abnormalities comprised trisomy 11 (2 patients), monosomy 11 (1 patient), del(11)(q23) (2 patients), add(11)(p15) (1 patient), and der(11) t(3;11)(p21;q23) (1 patient). Abnormalities involving band q23 of chromosome 11 occurred in 3 cases and were the most common alteration. However, specific chromosomal alterations were not associated with any FAB classification group. These findings and their implications in the biology of MDS are discussed.
