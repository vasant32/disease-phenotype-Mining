Adenoviruses (AdV) have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients after hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). Early diagnosis of the infection by detection of viral DNA may improve the prognosis. A surveillance strategy was evaluated for detection of AdV DNA by PCR in a prospective study of unselected allogeneic HSCT recipients. In parallel with a routine CMV surveillance program, plasma from 20 children and 77 adults was analyzed by quantitative PCR for detection of AdV DNA. In addition, in 12 unselected patients, the presence of AdV-specific T cells were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) at 1 to 3 months after transplantation. A total of 5 of 97 (5%) patients had detectable AdV DNA in peripheral blood. Only one patient had high titers and none developed AdV disease. BM as a source of stem cells and myelodysplastic syndrome as the indication for transplantation were independently associated with higher risk of acquiring AdV infection. AdV-specific T cells were detected in 7 (58%) of 12 patients. Although AdV DNA was found in peripheral blood by quantitative PCR in 5% of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, the present surveillance program did not have a significant effect on the clinical outcome.
