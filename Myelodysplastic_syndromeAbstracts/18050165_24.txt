 OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics and outcomes of vasculitides associated with malignancies. METHODS: The requirement for inclusion in this retrospective, 10-year study was development of vasculitis in patients with a progressing malignancy. Malignancies secondary to immunosuppressants used to treat vasculitis were excluded. The main characteristics of vasculitides were analyzed and compared according to the type of malignancy. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (male/female sex ratio 2.53, mean age 62.4 years). Mean followup duration was 45.2 months. Vasculitides were cutaneous leukocytoclastic (45%), polyarteritis nodosa (36.7%), Wegener's granulomatosis (6.7%), microscopic polyangiitis (5%), and Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (5%). Malignancies were distributed as follows: hematologic in 63.1%, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 32.3%, lymphoid in 29.2%, and solid tumor in 36.9%. Vasculitides were diagnosed concurrently with malignancy in 38% of the cases. Manifestations of vasculitides were fever (41.7%), cutaneous involvement (78.3%), arthralgias (46.7%), peripheral neuropathy (31.7%), renal involvement (23.3%; 11.7% glomerulonephritis, 11.7% microaneurysms, 6.7% renal insufficiency), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (20.4%). Vasculitis treatments were corticosteroids (78.3%) and immunosuppressant(s) (41.7%). Vasculitis was cured in 65% of patients, but 58.3% died, with 1 death secondary to vasculitis. Independent of subtype, patients with vasculitides associated with MDS more frequently had renal manifestations (P = 0.02) and steroid dependence (P = 0.04) and achieved complete remission less often (P = 0.04) than patients with vasculitides associated with other malignancies. Patients with vasculitides associated with a solid tumor more frequently had peripheral neurologic involvement (P = 0.05). Patients with vasculitides associated with lymphoid malignancy had less frequent arthralgias (P = 0.01) and renal involvement (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Vasculitides occurring during malignancies present distinctive features according to the vasculitis subtype and nature of the malignancy.
