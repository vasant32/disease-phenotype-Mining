 BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on myeloid malignancies are very rare in the literature due to a lack of registration by cancer registries until 2000. The Registry of Hematologic Malignancies of the CÃ´te d'Or Department in France has, however, steadfastly registered data on cases occurring in the Department since 1980, resulting, to date, in a database of over 5,000 cases classified according to the ICD-O-3 classification, following the most recent World Health Organization classification criteria. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five years of data on myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes were analyzed. World population standardized incidence rates were calculated as were as observed and relative survival. RESULTS: Incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants/year were 2.5 for acute myeloid leukemia, 1.3 for myelodysplastic syndromes, 3.2 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.6 for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes. It was found that the incidence rate of myelodysplastic syndromes increased significantly over the period. The median overall survival is 8.9 months for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 33.8 months for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, 91.7 months for those with myeloproliferative neoplasms and 26.6 months for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes. Observed and relative 20-year survival rates are, respectively, 12% and 13% in acute myeloid leukemia, 2% and 6% in myelodysplastic syndromes and 20% and 34% in myeloproliferative neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: These population-based data on myeloid malignancies are the first data collected over such a long period and provide interesting information for clinicians and public health authorities, particularly given the paucity of other long-term, population-based data from cancer registries.
