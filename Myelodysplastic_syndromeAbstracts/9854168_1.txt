We report on an 86-year-old man with an ulcerated nodule on his left lower leg. Peripheral blood examination and bone marrow findings were compatible with the refractory anemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) which is typical of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Because histological examination showed an infiltration of atypical cells of myeloid origin, this lesion was diagnosed as a specific lesion of MDS. Sometimes, only a subjective symptom, such as a skin lesion, precedes the diagnosis of MDS.
