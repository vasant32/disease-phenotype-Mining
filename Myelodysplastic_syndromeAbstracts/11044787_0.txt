BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is predominantly a disease of old age. The number of MDS cases diagnosed over the last 20 years has risen substantially due to increased awareness and improved geriatric care. Although MDS is increasingly diagnosed, the prevalence and prognosis of early-stage affected elderly are not completely known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, characteristics and prognosis of newly diagnosed MDS patients hospitalized in an acute and subacute geriatric department. METHODS: Between 1993 and 1996, 3,275 patients hospitalized in the geriatric department of a teaching hospital for acute care or short-term rehabilitation were investigated for unexplained hematological abnormalities. Demographic, chronic comorbidities, cause of hospitalization, functional and cognitive status, hematological and other laboratory parameters were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.5%) patients had unexplained cytopenia, macrocytosis or monocytosis, of whom 37 (15%) were diagnosed as having MDS. Only 9 patients were hospitalized for evaluation of anemia, 28 for infections, cardiac, cerebrovascular events and other causes. Thirty-four patients had refractory anemia (RA), two had RA with ringed sideroblasts and 1 had RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB). The follow-up period was up to 70 months. No differences were found between demented and cognitively normal patients in age, sex, comorbidities or laboratory parameters. Comparison of survival curves (excluding the RAEB case) according to demographic, clinical and hematological parameters has shown that only dementia adversely affects survival, compared to cognitively normal patients (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: MDS of the RA type is a common and incidental finding in older hospitalized patients. It is a frequent cause of anemia and other hematological abnormalities but has less significance on survival rates than dementia, although its full impact remains to be determined.
