Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a painful, often rapidly progressive, ulcerating skin disorder frequently associated with systemic diseases. We report the case of a patient with PG and an anemia. A bone marrow biopsy showed changes consistent with one of the myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. Patients with PG and anemia should have bone marrow biopsy if no cause of anemia is readily apparent.
