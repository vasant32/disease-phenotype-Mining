We report 4 unusual cases of myelodysplastic syndrome with distinct persistent nodular lesions noted on serial bone marrow examinations, even during remission. The lesions were predominantly composed of immature monocytes that stained positively for CD68. Trisomy 9 and 11 were demonstrated in the cells of the nodular lesions and surrounding marrow of 1 patient, indicating the same clonal origin. Evaluation of p53 glycoprotein, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), proliferation-related protein (Ki-67), multiple drug-resistant enzyme glutathione-S-transferase pi, and topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) revealed decreased topoisomerase expression within the nodular lesions compared with the surrounding marrow and absence of Ki-67 antigen within nodular lesions. Most cells in the lesion were not in a proliferative cycle, with very low expression of Topo IIalpha, which may explain the apparent drug resistance of these nodular lesions.
