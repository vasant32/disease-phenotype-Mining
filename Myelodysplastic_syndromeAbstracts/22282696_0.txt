The myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more of the major myeloid cell lines, ineffective hematopoiesis, and increased risk of development of acute myeloid leukemia. The classification and the diagnostic criteria have been redefined by the recent World Health Organization Classification of Tumors - International Agency for Research on Cancer for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. The myelodysplastic syndromes are now classified into the following categories - refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, myelodysplastic syndrome associated with isolated del (5q), myelodysplastic syndrome - unclassifiable, and childhood myelodysplastic syndrome. The clinicopathologic features, morphology, differential diagnosis, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, prognosis and predictive factors are presented in the light of recent World Health Organization Classification of Tumors - International Agency for Research on Cancer.
