Pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), though rare, constitutes a distinct entity quite different from adult MDS. They have unique clinical features, aggressive clinical course with an overall mean survival of only 9.9 months. A pediatric approach to the WHO classification has become necessary since the WHO classification of MDS has failed to address the uniqueness of pediatric MDS. A new prognostic system also needs to be evolved since the international prognostic system has limited prognostic impact in children. Intensive chemotherapy such as the one used in de novo-acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leads to complete remission in some children and this may be the treatment of choice in pediatric MDS.
