The majority of patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) die of complications due to cytopenia. Clinical trials have demonstrated that in an essential number of MDS patients cytopenia can be ameliorated by exogenously supplied growth factors. We investigated endogenous serum levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 in 15 healthy individuals and 34 patients suffering from MDS. No circulating growth factors were detected in the serum of healthy controls, nor was IL-3 measurable in MDS patients. GM-CSF serum levels, however, were elevated in a significant number of patients (26.5%). Levels did not correlate with FAB classification, leukocyte count or chromosomal abnormalities. No significant differences in GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor expression were detected between healthy individuals and MDS patients. One patient with increased endogenous GM-CSF serum level and normal surface receptor expression responded to exogenously applied GM-CSF. In the light of these results, a functional alteration of growth factor receptors or disturbances of signal transduction pathways must be discussed for MDS.
