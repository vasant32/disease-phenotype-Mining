Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders leading to peripheral cytopenias and a high probability of leukemic transformation. Immunological abnormalities, both humoral and cell mediated immunity, as well as vasculitis, a "lupus-like syndrome," neuropathy, and arthritis have been described in association with myelodysplastic syndromes. We describe 3 cases of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) developing within 4 months of detection of cytopenia. The possible association of myelodysplastic syndromes and PMR has not been previously recognized.
