To obtain background information on elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unselected data covering 159 patients aged 60 years or over with AML from 14 hospitals in Nagoya, Japan was analyzed retrospectively. Among these patients, 119 had de novo acute AML, 32 had AML which evolved from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML), and 8 had other types of leukemia. The survey showed that MDS-AML tended to be more prevalent in patients aged 70 years and older and that MDS-AML showed a significantly more severe degree of leukopenia and anemia than de novo AML. MDS-AML also showed a significantly lower complete remission (CR) rate than that of de novo AML [6.9% (2/29) vs 58.3% (67/11), P < 0.01] and significantly shorter survival times than those of de novo AML [median: 3.6 months vs 9.6 months, P < 0.01 (generalized Wilcoxon test; GW]. In de novo AML, the proportion of patients treated with conventional therapy (CT group) decreased significantly, and that of those with attenuated therapy (AT group) increased significantly as age elevated (P < 0.01). The CT group showed a significantly higher CR rate (65.4% vs 41.2%, P < 0.05) and a significantly longer survival period than those of the AT group [median: 11.6 months vs 4.8 months, P < 0.05 (GW)]. Overall survival rates of the older age groups became significantly shorter with aging [P < 0.01 (GW)].
