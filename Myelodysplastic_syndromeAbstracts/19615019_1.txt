Myeloid leukemia cutis (LC) is the cutaneous involvement by neoplastic leukocytes of the myeloid series. Myeloid LC may occur de novo or concurrently with acute myeloid leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemias, other myeloproliferative disorders or myelodysplastic syndromes. We describe an unusual case of cytophagic S-100 protein immunoreactive leukemia cutis presenting in an 87-year-old woman without prior history of myeloid leukemia or other hematologic disorders. We outline key histologic and immunohistochemical features that aide in the diagnosis of LC. The presence of cytophagocytosis on histologic examination, a phenomenon more commonly associated with lymphoid rather than myeloid malignancies, provided a clue to the possibility of a malignant process. The atypical myeloid infiltrate showed S-100 protein positivity, an unusual finding that may be seen in LC. Although not commonly reported in LC, the presence of S-100 protein positivity and cytophagocytosis should not lead to the premature exclusion of LC as a possible diagnosis until a thorough clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation is performed. In addition, the presence of cytophagocytosis has been shown to have prognostic significance for patients with myeloid leukemia.
