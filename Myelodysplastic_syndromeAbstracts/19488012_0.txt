A 53-year-old diabetic woman with the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of anorexia, malaise, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. The radiological evaluation revealed waxing and waning pulmonary nodules. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was reached by pathologic examination of a wedge biopsy. We did not find a similar case in the literature. Clinicians should keep tuberculosis in mind as a possible etiology of waxing and waning pulmonary nodules.
