OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. METHODS: CD34+ cells from 16 MDS patients were purified up to 96% approximately 99% by means of a immunomagnetic beads sorting system. The effects of individual and combination of HGFs on the proliferation and differentiation of the CD34+ cells were studied in semi -solid cultures. RESULTS: CD34+ cells were impaired and none of the individual HGF (GM-CSF, IL-3, SCF) could effectively support their proliferation and differentiation. rh-SCF combined with GM-CSF, IL-3 or Epo could partly increase the colony forming capacity of MDS hematopoietic progenitor, however, an increase of undifferentiated blast cells colonies occurred in some high-risk MDS patients at the same time. CONCLUSION: Proper combination of HGFs was essential for improving hematopoiesis in MDS patients.
