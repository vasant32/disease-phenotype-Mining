Hyperdiploidy of > or =58 chromosomes is reported in 0.5-3% of hematological malignancies, but reports of near-triploidy (58-80 chromosomes) and near-tetraploidy (81-103 chromosomes), are few. We examined these chromosome abnormalities and analyzed the relationship with the mutation of the p53 gene. Thirty-one of 979 adult patients (3.2%) with hematological malignancies were identified as having near-triploid or near-tetraploid (tri-/tetraploid) chromosomes. These included 11 with B-cell neoplasms, seven with Hodgkin's lymphoma, five with T-cell neoplasms, four with myelodysplastic syndromes and four with acute myeloid leukemias. All patients had concurrent complex chromosome aberrations. Deletion of one allele of the p53 gene was found in two patients and a point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in five patients. Although abnormalities of the p53 gene have been reported in about 10% of hematological malignancies, these were found in seven of 31 (23%) patients with tri-/tetraploidy. These findings suggest that the abnormality of the p53 gene may be closely related with tri-/tetraploidy. The four myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with tri-/tetraploidy had a significantly worse prognosis than those with diploid cytogenetics (n = 35; P < 0.002). In B-cell neoplasms (n = 3), triploidy was associated with a worse prognosis than tetraploidy (n = 8) and diploidy (n = 130; P < 0.02).
