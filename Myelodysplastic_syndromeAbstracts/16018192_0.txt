Nucleophosmin (NPM) is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein. NPM gene involved chromosomal translocations were found in the patients with anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). To generate NPM gene knockout mice and study its biological function in vivo, we screened the lambda phage genomic library derived from 129S1 mice with mouse NPM cDNA probe. A positive phage clone which contained the full-length NPM genomic DNA was obtained and the insert of 15.3 kb genomic DNA in this clone was sequenced with shotgun method. BLAST analysis showed that the sequence of insert are 99.8% identity to that of NPM gene of C57BL/6 mouse strain. Based on the sequence, bioinformatics analysis on genomic structure of NPM and the transcription factor binding sites in the NPM 5' flanking region were performed.
