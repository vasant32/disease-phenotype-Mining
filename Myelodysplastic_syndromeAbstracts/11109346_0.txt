A 43-year-old man with no past history presented with symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnoea arising from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and was found to have myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7. Before initiation of chemotherapy, he deteriorated rapidly, developing multi-organ failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and he eventually succumbed despite amphotericin B treatment. The importance of monosomy 7 in determining immune function in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome is emphasised.
