A patient with myelodysplastic syndromes (formerly described as pre-leukemia or smoldering acute leukemia) who underwent an open-heart surgery due to Candida endocarditis using cardiopulmonary bypass is reported. Pancytopenias on admission were normalized before an operation with the preoperative administration of the human colony-stimulating factors. Open-heart surgery was accomplished safely without any bleeding complications or infections.
