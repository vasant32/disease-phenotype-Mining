The "dU suppression" test, studying thymine-DNA synthesis from deoxyuridine is abnormal in folate and vitamin B12 deficiency, these two vitamins being involved in this reaction. We have done it in 7 cases of anaemia by folate deficiency, 12 cases of anaemia by vitamin B12 deficiency, in 3 cases of combined deficiency, in 3 cases of acute myelo√Ød leukaemia, 2 cases of sideroblastic anaemia and 2 cases of intoxication by antifolate. This test is very sensitive: it is abnormal even when there is an anaemia related to a vitamin deficiency with only very light morphologic abnormalities and can discriminate the cases, mainly in myelodysplastic syndromes, where folate deficiency is only an epiphenomen in the genesis of anaemia. The abnormalities of the "dU suppression" are quite corrected by added folate derivatives in folate deficiency. However, cobalamin derivatives did not correct completely the test in vitamin B12 deficiency except when a folate compound is also added. The "dU suppression" test becomes normal about one week after starting vitaminotherapy in vitamin B12 deficiency.
