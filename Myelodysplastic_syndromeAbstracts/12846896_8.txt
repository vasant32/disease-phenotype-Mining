Thirteen patients with low-to-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) received recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) at the single, weekly dose of 40.000 U for at least 8 weeks. Five patients (38.4%) achieved a major erythroid response (increased haemoglobin levels > 2 g/dl and/or transfusion independence), which is currently maintained after 3-11 months, without modification of r-EPO dose. This study suggests that 40.000 U r-EPO given once a week may be at least as effective as the more frequent (daily or three times a week) administrations of the drug usually employed in MDS patients.
