Mitochondrial genome instability has recently been demonstrated in a wide variety of human tumours and is implicated in the development of the myelodysplastic syndromes, a heterogeneous group of haematological disorders with an increased risk of malignant transformation. We therefore investigated the incidence of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in patients with adult-onset leukaemia. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome from both normal tissue (buccal epithelial cells) and the leukaemia from 24 patients with adult-onset leukaemia. Somatic mtDNA mutation was present in nine individuals ( approximately 40%) and in each case the tumour genome differed from the normal genome sequence by a single sequence change. Using PCR-RFLP analysis and real-time PCR, we have studied in detail the mutation present in one patient with acute lymphatic leukaemia, demonstrating that the mutation is associated specifically with the leukaemia.
