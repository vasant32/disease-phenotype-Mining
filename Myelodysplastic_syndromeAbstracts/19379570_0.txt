The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of cyclin A1 mRNA in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its clinical significance. The expression of cyclin A1, cdk2 and p21(cip1) mRNA in the bone marrow from 56 patients with MDS and 10 normal control were measured by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. The results indicated that the positive rate and the expression level of cyclin A1 in MDS patients (69.64%; 0.964 +/- 1.879) were significantly higher than those in normal control (0%; 0.012 +/- 0.014) (p < 0.01). Among de-novo MDS patients, the expression level of cyclin A1 mRNA in the MDS-RAEB group (1.895 +/- 1.769) was higher than that in MDS-RA group (0.629 +/- 1.583) (p < 0.01). The expression level of cyclin A1 mRNA in post-treatment group was significantly lower than that in prior-treatment group (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the mRNA expression of cyclin A1 in MDS patients is higher than that in normal control, the abnormal expression of cyclin A1 may be used as a prognostic marker in MDS patients.
