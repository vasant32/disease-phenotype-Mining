We studied a retrospective cohort of 282 higher-risk MDS treated with azacitidine, including 32 patients who concomitantly received an ESA for a median of 5.8 months after azacitidine onset. Forty-four percent of ESA and 29% of no-ESA patients reached HI-E (p=0.07); 48% and 20% achieved transfusion independence (p=0.01). Median OS was 19.6 months in the ESA and 11.9 months in the no-ESA groups (p=0.04). Addition of an ESA significantly improved OS (p=0.03) independently of azacitidine schedule and duration, and of our proposed azacitidine risk score (Blood 2011;117:403-11). Adding an ESA to azacitidine in higher-risk MDS should be studied prospectively.
