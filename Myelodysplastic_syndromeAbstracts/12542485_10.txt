We report a case of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) with t(10;16)(q22;p13), in which novel fusion transcripts of the MORF and CBP genes were detected. In one MORF-CBP fusion transcript, exon 15 of the MORF gene was fused in frame with exon 5 of the CBP gene. In a reciprocal CBP-MORF transcript, exon 4 of the CBP gene was fused in frame with exon 16 of the MORF gene. This is the first reported case of t-MDS associated with t(10;16), and provides molecular evidence that the novel MORF-CBP and/or CBP-MORF fusion protein(s) might play an important role in the development of t-MDS.
