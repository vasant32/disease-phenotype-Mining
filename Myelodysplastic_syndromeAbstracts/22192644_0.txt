More than 3 million patients around the world have received clopidogrel, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which has largely replaced ticlopidine in clinical practice as it was believed to be devoid of the side effects caused by ticlopidine. We herein report the case of a woman who developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after 1 year of treatment with clopidogrel. The absence of other plausible causes suggests that her MDS was induced by clopidogrel. Although this is a very rare case, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of MDS associated with clopidogrel use.
