Differentiation induction therapy is used in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to improve maturation defects and to restore impaired function of malignant cells. To this end, 18 patients with MDS received either a combination therapy consisting in study 1 of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or in study 2 of a combination with ATRA, G-CSF, erythropoietin (Epo) and tocopherol. The ANC increased in 19/20 patients in both studies, whereas an increase in haemoglobin concentration, platelet counts or reduction of transfusion requirement was seen in only 8/20 patients, correlating strongly with good BFU-E growth (P < 0.001). To assess the role of accessory cells in the modulation of the haemopoietic response to treatment, we analysed the capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to secrete cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha). Secretion of all cytokines was significantly reduced before therapy when compared with healthy controls, but increased during therapy, reaching normal levels for IL-8. These data indicate that a combination therapy with ATRA and cytokines improves impaired cytokine secretion from monocytes and induces a multilineage clinical response in a subgroup of MDS patients characterized by an almost intact erythroid compartment. In contrast, induction of TNF alpha might be responsible for treatment failure.
