A 41-year-old female patient with mental retardation and generalized epileptic seizure had a nonmosaic idic (X) (pter-q21.32::q21.32-pter) chromosome in peripheral lymphocytes and bone marrow cells. Primary amenorrhea, myelodysplastic syndrome, pigmented nevi and characteristic facial appearance were also observed. A few cases with the nonmosaic idic (X) (q::q) with various breakpoints reported previously commonly showed ovarian failure with dysfunction of relevant hormone. CNS abnormalities of the present case were demonstrated by CT, MRI and SPECT using 123I-IMP. CNS abnormalities were considered to be possibly due to karyotype with a nonmosaic idic (X) (q21.32).
