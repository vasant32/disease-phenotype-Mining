 OBJECTIVE: The progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) is generally incurable and its prognosis is extremely poor. It is important to determine the predictive factors of response and survival in diseases treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had been diagnosed of MDS/AML and had undergone chemotherapy between April 2001 and March 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 21 patients had an abnormal karyotype. Among them, 13 had complex type abnormalities and/or monosomy 7. Twenty-four patients were administered a low-dose AraC containing regimen and 5 received an AML-like regimen as the initial chemotherapy. The responses were CR4/PR2/NR23. The response rate (RR) in the patients with a normal karyotype was significantly better than in those with an abnormal karyotype (62.5% vs. 4.8%, p=0.003). Univariate analyses showed that the hemoglobin level and cytogenetic abnormalities were factors that contributed to the overall survival. CONCLUSION: In MDS/AML, patients with a normal karyotype tended to have a better response to chemotherapy. The hemoglobin level and cytogenetic abnormalities were significant factors affecting the overall survival.
