Two cases of invasive aspergillosis are reported. Case 1, a 3-year-old boy with leukemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome, had an aspergillus infection in the hand, resulting in necrosis of the thumb. Case 2, an 18-year-old girl with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, had an aspergillus skin infection on the wrist, accompanied by swelling and discoloration of the arm. In Case 2, angiography revealed a hypovascular lesion and vascular irregularity, suggesting that vessels were involved. Intraarterial infusion of urokinase and amphotericin B led to improvement of these symptoms in this patient. The combination of urokinase and an antifungal drug should be considered for intractable aspergillus infections involving the extremities.
