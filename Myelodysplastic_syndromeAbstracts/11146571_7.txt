BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a multifunctional cytokine that exerts positive regulation in hematopoiesis and that may also have a role in myelofibrosis and angiogenesis. We used bone marrow immunohistochemical stains to obtain additional insight into the cellular distribution of bFGF in both chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow immunohistochemical stains were used to evaluate the cellular distribution of bFGF in 29 patients with CMPD, 31 patients with MDS, and 5 normal controls. RESULTS: The density of bFGF-expressing stromal cells was markedly increased in 74% of the patients with MDS, compared with in only 3% of those with CMPD. In contrast, the density was markedly decreased in 62% of the patients with CMPD (versus 6% in MDS). The staining pattern in normal controls was similar to that in patients with MDS. The presence or absence of associated bone marrow fibrosis did not influence the particular pattern of bFGF expression in either MDS or CMPD. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that bone marrow stromal cell bFGF expression in patients with CMPD is abnormally decreased and that the particular staining pattern may complement the morphologic distinction between CMPD and MDS.
