A 64-year-old woman presented with cardiomegaly, Sweet's syndrome, and refractory anemia (RA), and died of sudden cardiac arrest. The autopsy revealed a perivascular and myocardial infiltration by neutrophils, which could be responsible for the cardiomegaly and probably had caused disturbances in the conduction system leading to sudden cardiac arrest. Myocardial infiltration by functionally defective neutrophils can develop in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) without peripheral neutrophilia or leukemic blood picture and needs a special diagnostic and therapeutic consideration.
