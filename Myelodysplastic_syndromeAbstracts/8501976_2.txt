One of the first known effects of the endogenous peptide N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is to inhibit entry into DNA synthesis of pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) in mice. A specific anti-AcSDKP polyclonal antibody allows the level of the tetrapeptide by to be determined by enzyme immunoassay with good sensitivity and specificity. We present results demonstrating the presence of AcSDKP in humans: serum levels of 34 healthy controls were found to be between 0.7 and 2.5 pm/ml, regardless of age and sex. High levels were found in 44% of asymptomatic controls but only in 8% of AIDS patients out of a total of 37 patients with HIV. Subsequently, studies of serum levels were performed before treatment in 121 subjects with disorders of the nonlymphoid and the lymphoid lineages. Our results did not demonstrate any decrease in serum levels, however a moderate or marked increase was noted in one-third of the subjects, which was greater in disorders of the non-lymphoid lineages (48% of 72 patients) than the lymphoid lineage (21% of 50 patients). The most significant differences were observed between controls versus patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD, 24 patients: p < 0.001), controls versus patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML, 15 patients: p < 0.02), as well as patients with AML versus patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (PMDS, 10 patients: p < 0.05). The pathophysiology of these abnormalities is discussed.
