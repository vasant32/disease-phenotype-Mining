 OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of common fusion genes analysis in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia by multiplex RT-PCR. METHODS: The multiplex RT-PCR, including 8 parallel PCR reactions, could screen 86 mRNA breakpoints or splice variants at the same time, which was important for the diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Bone marrow samples from 161 cases of leukemia and 8 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were involved in the study. The distribution of common fusion genes in leukemia was analyzed by the method mentioned above in combination with clinical and morphological features. RESULTS: Ten fusion genes were detected in 115 cases of leukemia, including AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, PLZF/RAR alpha, dupMLL, MLL/AF6, MLL/AF10, CBFbeta/MYH11, BCR/ABL, Hox11, and EVI1 BCR/ABL was positive in all the 52 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia; PML/RAR alpha was found in 21 of 25 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and PLZF/RAR alpha was detected in one case of APL. Sixteen cases of 17 AML1/ETO-positive acute leukemia (AL) belonged to FAB-M2 subtype, and one case was mixed leukemia. Three of 4 AL cases carrying CBFbeta/MYH11 were M4 subtype, and one was M5 subtype. MLL aberrations were found in 16 AL, in which all MLL/AF6 translocation existed in M5 subtype with classic monoblastic characters. Furthermore, BCR/ABL was detected in 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. Fusion genes were also found in 2 MDS cases, of which AML1/ETO positive-MDS-RAEB progressed to AML rapidly. CONCLUSION: Screening of common fusion genes by multiplex RT-PCR is an important tool which could provide useful and reliable molecular genetic information for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.
