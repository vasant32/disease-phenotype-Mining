Concurrent emergence of nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor; WT) and neuroblastoma (NB) is rare and mostly observed in patients with severe subtypes of Fanconi anemia (FA) with or without VACTER-L association (VL). We investigated the hypothesis that early consequences of genomic instability result in shared regions with copy number variation in different precursor cells that originate distinct embryonal tumors. We observed a newborn girl with FA and VL (aplasia of the thumbs, cloacal atresia (urogenital sinus), tethered cord at L3/L4, muscular ventricular septum defect, and horseshoe-kidney with a single ureter) who simultaneously acquired an epithelial-type WT in the left portion of the kidney and a poorly differentiated adrenal NB in infancy. A novel homozygous germline frameshift mutation in PALB2 (c.1676_c1677delAAinsG) leading to protein truncation (pGln526ArgfsX1) inherited from consanguineous parents formed the genetic basis of FA-N. Spontaneous and induced chromosomal instability was detected in the majority of cells analyzed from peripheral lymphocytes, bone marrow, and cultured fibroblasts. Bone marrow cells also showed complex chromosome rearrangements consistent with the myelodysplastic syndrome at 11 months of age. Array-comparative genomic hybridization analyses of both WT and NB showed shared gains or amplifications within the chromosomal regions 11p15.5 and 17q21.31-q25.3, including genes that are reportedly implicated in tumor development such as IGF2, H19, WT2, BIRC5, and HRAS.
