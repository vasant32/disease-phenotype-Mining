Four patients with severe aplastic anemia and one patient with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) were treated with antilymphocyte and antithymocyte globulins. One patient in aplastic anemia who achieved good response by ALG administration had a possible diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. ATG was administered to only one case of aplastic anemia and ALG was administered to the remainder. In the result, three out of 4 patients with aplastic anemia and one patient with PRCA achieved good response without severe side effects. Three patients with aplastic anemia had high CD4/CD8 ratio in their peripheral lymphocytes. This ratio normalized after ALG therapy in effective cases, but not in ineffective case. Natural killer activity elevated after ALG therapy in two effective cases of aplastic anemia and PRCA, but not in one ineffective case of aplastic anemia.
