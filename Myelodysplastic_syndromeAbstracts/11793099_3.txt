Several reports have documented various forms of glomerular diseases in adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but similar reports in children are lacking. We describe two children with MDS-associated steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome (NS). Patient 1, who had MDS with myelofibrosis, presented with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, chronic hepatitis, moderate proteinuria, hypocomplementemia and elevated ANA titer. During initial prednisone treatment proteinuria markedly diminished and partial but transient hematological improvement occurred. Relapse subsequently occurred that manifested by overt NS and pancytopenia. High doses of prednisolone led to remission of the renal disease, but hematological remission did not occur. Persisting pancytopenia and repeated infections terminated in sepsis, 2 years after the onset of the MDS. Patient 2, who had refractory anemia with clonal monosomy 19, presented with bowel disease, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Prednisone led to both clinical and hematological remission. The hematologic disease relapsed 12 months later, when nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria and mild azotemia were also found. Corticosteroid treatment led to long-lasting renal and hematologic remission, maintained by a small dosage of prednisone. In both patients, renal biopsy findings were consistent with those seen in idiopathic NS. A Medline search disclosed 16 cases of glomerulopathy in the course of MDS in adult patients. Clinical features included NS, usually accompanied by renal insufficiency with acute, chronic, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. On biopsy, membranous nephropathy, crescentic or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and AL amyloidosis were found. We conclude: (1) that glomerular disease may be present and should be searched for in patients with MDS and (2) that MDS can be added to the list of rare conditions associated with corticosteroid-responsive NS in children.
