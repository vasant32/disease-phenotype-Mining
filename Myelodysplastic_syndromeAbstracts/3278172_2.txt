Activation of the cellular oncogene c-N-ras has been frequently observed in DNA from leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ras gene activation sufficient to mediate in vitro transformation and rodent tumorigenesis usually results from point mutations and amino acid substitutions in the 12th or 61st codons. In AML and the related myelodysplastic syndromes, amino acid substitution at the 13th codon has been observed. An activated c-N-ras gene from a 45-year-old patient with AML was isolated by transfection analysis and subjected to molecular cloning and sequence analysis. A point mutation of the 12th codon (GGT to GAT) resulting in aspartic acid substitution for glycine was observed. In other neoplasms such as colon cancer, specific ras mutations occur predominantly (e.g., K-ras, codon 12). This predominance has been of demonstrable value in analyzing large cohorts for ras activation with techniques that are rapid and economical, such as oligonucleotide hybridization. It had previously been thought that such a predominance for activation of c-N-ras at codon 13 existed in AML; however, this study in concert with others underscores the importance of 12th codon c-N-ras mutations, along with 13th and 61st codon mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of AML. Guanylate to adenylate transition mutations are commonly observed in AML and may provide insight into potential environmental leukemogens. Addressing all commonly prevalent ras activating mutations bears impact in the future design of molecular surveys of the role of ras activation in leukemogenesis.
