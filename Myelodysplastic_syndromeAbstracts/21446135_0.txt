 INTRODUCTION: The expression of CD34 antigen is increased in a substantial portion of MDS patients, particularly in high risk patients, which was associated with unfavorable survival in some studies. The aim of this study was to determine the CD34 expression in bone marrow biopsies and its prognostic significance in MDS patients and to analyze it in the context of different clinical, laboratory and prognostic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 53 MDS patients and 20 controls with normal bone marrow. The CD34 expression was determined by CD34 monoclonal antibody and labelled streptovidin biotin peroxidase method. The positivity was determined by counting the 500 cells and it was expressed as percentage. RESULTS: Among the 53 MDS patients there were 37 males and 16 females with average age of 62. The average CD34 expression in the MDS group was 1.37%, the range being 0-8.8%, and in the control group 0.78%, the range being 0-1.60%. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the CD34 expression comparing RA and CMML group and high risk and low risk MDS (p < 0.02). The median survival in the patients with the CD34 expression with less than 2% was 22 months, while it was 6 months in the patients with the CD34 expression over 2% (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis the CD34 expression together with the karyotype and transfusion dependence had a statistical significance (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The CD34 expression in bone marrow biopsies is higher in the MDS patients comparing with the controls as well as in high risk comparing with low risk patients. The cutoff 2% seems to have a prognostic significance.
