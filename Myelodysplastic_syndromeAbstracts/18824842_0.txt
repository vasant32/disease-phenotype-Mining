 BACKGROUND: Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) target proteins needing prenylation for functioning. Tipifarnib (Zarnestra), a potent and specific inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, showed considerable activity in phase I and II studies in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but the optimal regimen achieving high response rates with minor myelosuppression remains to be determined. Additionally, a direct effect on purified human MDS progenitors has not yet been shown. METHODS: MDS and normal CD34+ cells isolated by using immunomagnetic beads were plated for short-term cultures in semisolid media or liquid cultures for flow-cytometric assessment of apoptosis in the presence of either DMSO or various FTI concentrations. RESULTS: Tipifarnib exerted selective in vitro toxicity against clonal MDS hematopoiesis at concentrations less than 10 nM the effect being more prominent in white cell progenitors. This action was not due to apoptosis induction as both normal and MDS progenitors displayed equivalent DiOC3 and annexin V expression up to 72 h after exposure to tipifarnib. CONCLUSION: The leukemic clone is more susceptible in tipifarnib than normal progenitors. Since myelosuppression represents the main obstacle in the clinical use of tipifarnib in MDS, further reduction of the currently employed dose will potentially result in a more tolerable regimen without compromising its antileukemic action.
