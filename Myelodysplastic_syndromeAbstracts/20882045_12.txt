This cooperative study assessed prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 541 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and deletion 5q. Additional chromosomal abnormalities were strongly related to different patients' characteristics. In multivariate analysis, the most important predictors of both OS and AML transformation risk were number of chromosomal abnormalities (P<0.001 for both outcomes), platelet count (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively) and proportion of bone marrow blasts (P<0.001 and P=0.016, respectively). The number of chromosomal abnormalities defined three risk categories for AML transformation (del(5q), del(5q)+1 and del(5q)+ ≥ 2 abnormalities) and two for OS (one group: del(5q) and del(5q)+1; and del(5q)+ ≥ 2 abnormalities, as the other one); with a median survival time of 58.0 and 6.8 months, respectively. Platelet count (P=0.001) and age (P=0.034) predicted OS in patients with '5q-syndrome'. This study demonstrates the importance of additional chromosomal abnormalities in MDS patients with deletion 5q, challenges the current '5q-syndrome' definition and constitutes a useful reference series to properly analyze the results of clinical trials in these patients.
