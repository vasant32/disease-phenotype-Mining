Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a hematopoietic disorder for which formal tracking began as recently as 2001, is rapidly gaining recognition as a cause of anemia. The incidence of MDS increases with age and is considered the most common hematologic cancer in the elderly. The disease can follow an indolent course or rapidly progress to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Comorbidities and functional issues make this disease challenging to diagnose and treat in geriatric patients. This article reviews the epidemiology, classification, and treatment options for MDS.
