The in vitro growth and clinical response of leukemia cells to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were studied in 24 patients with acute leukemia. Among cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, a positive response to M-CSF (stimulation index > or = 2.5) was seen in 27.3% of the cases, and a significantly higher response rate (81.8%) was seen following G-CSF treatment of leukemia cells in vitro. In cases of acute monocytic leukemia, M-CSF showed a higher stimulating index than that observed for non-monocytic leukemia. G-CSF was administered in 19 cases and M-CSF in 5 cases after chemotherapy, and none of the patients showed leukemia cell proliferation in vivo. There was no correlation between in vitro test results and clinical response of leukemia cells to the CSFs administered.
