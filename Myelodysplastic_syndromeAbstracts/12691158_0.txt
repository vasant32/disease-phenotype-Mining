The effects of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-778,123 on the proliferation of normal, MDS, AML, and CML hemopoietic progenitor cells was studied. MDS myeloid and erythroid progenitors are significantly more sensitive to FTI than normal progenitors while AML myeloid progenitors may be somewhat more sensitive than normal progenitors. In contrast, no difference between CML and normal progenitors are detectable. These data strongly suggest that a trial of this agent in patients with MDS and perhaps in patients with AML is indicated.
