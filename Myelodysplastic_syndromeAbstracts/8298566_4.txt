Over the past decade infections from food-borne Listeria monocytogenes have become an important cause of septicaemia and meningitis and immunocompromised patients are at particular risk. We report three cases of Listeria meningitis occurring post-BMT. The patients were aged 53, 51 and 56 years and presented 4, 7 and 90 months post-transplant, respectively. The first patient had undergone allogeneic BMT for myelodysplasia and the other two patients had ABMT for AML in second and first CR, respectively. All the patients presented with classical features of meningitis and L. monocytogenes was cultured from cerebrospinal fluid. All made a full recovery with appropriate antibiotic therapy. We have not seen cases of meningitis due to other organisms in our transplant programme and the cases represent a risk of one episode per 59 surviving patient years. None of the patients was receiving prophylactic post-BMT antibiotics and the episodes may strengthen the case for using prophylactic penicillin. Recent epidemics of septicaemia and meningitis caused by L. monocytogenes-contaminated milk and cheese suggest that these patients should be informed about potential sources of infection.
