We evaluated the prognostic value of serum ferritin (SF) level at diagnosis in 318 newly diagnosed IPSS low and int 1 (lower) risk MDS patients included in the French MDS registry, who did not require RBC transfusions and had baseline SF level determination. Increased baseline SF level (>300 ng/ml) was correlated with male gender, more pronounced anaemia, and diagnosis of RARS but had no negative impact on progression to AML or survival.
