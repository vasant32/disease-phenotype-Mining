 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Yisui Jiedu Recipe (YSJDR), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on cytokines and their corresponding just another kinase 2-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (JAK2-STAT5) signal transduction pathway in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (MDS-RA). METHODS: Fluorogenic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) method was established to detect the levels of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNA expressions, and JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction pathway was activated by granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in cultured bone marrow hematopoietic cells from 10 patients with MDS-RA. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), gamma-interferon (gamma-INF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the cultural supernatant of untreated control, AG490-treated and YSJDF-treated cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha in YSJDR-treated group were significantly lower than those in untreated control group and AG490-treated group (P<0.01, P<0.05), and IL-3 level in YSJDP-treated group was remarkably higher than that in the other two groups (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2 and IL-3 between AG490-treated group and untreated control group (P>0.05), while the TNF-alpha level in AG490-treated group was decreased obviously as compared with the untreated control group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in gamma-INF level between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group (P>0.05), while TNF-alpha level in the two groups were significantly lower than that in the untreated control group (P<0.01). The expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNAs were significantly down-regulated in the YSJDR-treated and the AG490-treated groups as compared with those in the untreated control group (P<0.05, P<0.01), while there were no differences in the expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNAs between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group. CONCLUSION: YSJDR can modulate cytokine level in bone marrow hematopoietic cells of MDS-RA, suppress JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction, and inhibit the Bcl-xL mRNA expression.
