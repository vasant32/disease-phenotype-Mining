Duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) is widely reported in human neoplasia, including the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). So far, it has not been described as a single aberration in the chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a subtype of MDS. Rather, trisomy 1q was always a part of complex chromosome changes affecting the subtypes of MDS other than CMML. We report on a patient with CMML with an unbalanced translocation of the entire 1q onto the short arm of chromosome 14 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with an alpha-satellite probe for the paracentric region of the long arm of chromosome 1 confirmed the presence of trisomy 1q in a derivative chromosome, der(14)t(1;14)(q12;p11). The discrepant results between the metaphase cytogenetics (100% abnormal) and interphase cytogenetic (71% nuclei with 3 signals) suggest that trisomy 1q, even in the absence of additional cytogenetic changes, has a sufficient leukemogenic potential to confer a proliferative advantage on hematopoietic cells committed to monocyte stemline both in vitro and in vivo. The literature data on partial and complete trisomy 1q in CMML is reviewed.
