A case of therapy-related myelodysplasia followed by acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in a 5-year-old child successfully treated for diffuse Langerhans cell histiocytosis is described. A syndrome of severe cell-mediated immune deficiency and persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection coincided with the evolution of myelodysplasia. Specific abnormalities of chromosomes number 7 and 3 were associated with the onset of myelodysplasia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and are believed to be linked to the patient's immune dysfunction and compromised ability to contain viral infection.
