Twenty eight patients of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with low dose cytosine arabinoside to study the effect of this treatment modality. All patients presented with a hemoglobin of less than 12 Gm/dl, 4 (15%) had neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 x 10(6)/L and 18 (65%) had thrombocytopenia of less than 100 x 10(9)/L. The subtypes according to the bone marrow evaluation included 14 patients of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 10 refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Five patients (18%) achieved complete hematological response, 10 (36%) had a partial response and 9 (33%) patients had no response. Four patients died early during treatment due to tumor lysis (1 CMML) and hemorrhage (3 RAEB). Seven patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while on therapy and three progressed to AML after completion of therapy. Five patients died of hemorrhage and 3 of septicaemia after achieving an objective response. The mean duration of follow up in these patient was 8 months (range 1 month-3 years). Only 3 patients of RAEB have survived for greater than 2 years. Our data reveals the short term benefit of this mode of therapy and emphasizes the need to develop newer therapeutic approaches.
