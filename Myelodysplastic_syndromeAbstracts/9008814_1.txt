In adults the development of modern equipment for ambulatory monitoring permits long-term evaluation of the lower urinary tract which is more accurate than standard urodynamics (SUD). In children continuous urodynamic monitoring (CUM) has been used infrequently and therefore standardisation of the method has not been previously achieved, nor have the techniques and difficulties of performing 24-hour monitoring been solved. The aim of this study was to identify a technical method of CUM in children which was feasible and to verify its usefulness. For this purpose, we reviewed our preliminary experiences of CUM in children with neuropathic bladder. From March to November 1995 we made an outpatient study of the neuropathic bladders of 11 myelodysplastic children aged 1 to 18 years (average age 10.2 years). 7 of them were males and 4 females. All underwent SUD. With the children resting in bed, a 6-hour CUM (Lectromed MPR-2) was performed using a 4 Fr. microtip intravesical catheter (suprapubic in 3 infants and transurethral in 8 children) and an intrarectal catheter. The parents and/or a nurse monitored the fluid intake and micturition events and recorded the data in a diary. Based on the CUM experience in infants with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the 3 suprapubic studies were done after 12 hours of urethral drainage in order to prevent leakage of urine. In all of the patients we were able to study 2 to 4 bladder fillings during a period of 6 to 8 hours (average 6.5 hours) observation. In 9 of the 11 children the CUM pattern was comparable to the SUD one but in the 2 remaining patients CUM showed uninhibited contractions. Higher uninhibited voiding contraction pressures were recorded in hyper-reflexic bladders. Our preliminary results show that it is feasible to perform CUM in children and that it has advantages over standard cystometry in the investigation of children with neuropathic bladder even if it is carried out for short term (6 hours).
