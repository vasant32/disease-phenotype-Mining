Thalidomide was administered to 83 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), starting at 100 mg by mouth daily and increasing to 400 mg as tolerated. Thirty-two patients stopped therapy before 12 weeks (minimum period for response evaluation), and 51 completed 12 weeks of therapy. International Working Group response criteria for MDS were used to evaluate responses. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis classified all off-study patients as nonresponders. Off-study patients belonged to a higher risk category (P =.002) and had a higher percentage of blasts in their pretherapy bone marrow than patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy (P =.003). No cytogenetic or complete responses were seen, but 16 patients showed hematologic improvement, with 10 previously transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion independent. Responders had lower pretherapy blasts (P =.016), a lower duration of pretherapy platelet transfusions (P =.013), and higher pretherapy platelets (P =.003). Among responders, 9 had refractory anemia (RA); 5 had RA with ringed sideroblasts; and 2 had RA with excess blasts. By ITT analysis, 19% of patients (16 of 83) responded, and when only evaluable patients were analyzed, 31% (16 of 51) responded. It was concluded that thalidomide, as a single agent, is effective in improving cytopenias of some MDS patients, especially those who present without excess blasts. (Blood. 2001;98:958-965)
