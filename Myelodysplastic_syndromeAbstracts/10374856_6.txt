We have conducted a multicenter collaborative retrospective analysis to evaluate clinical characteristics and to compare prognostic scoring systems of 149 Korean patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 17-82 years) with high of the patients being younger than 40 years. Median survival was 22.6 months, and 25 patients (17%) progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with a median interval of 6 months (range 1-45 months). Major independent variables assessed by multivariate analysis were FAB subtypes and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages for survival and BM blast percentages for AML transformation. To compare the various scoring systems in the prediction for survival and transformation to AML, FAB, Sanz and Bournemouth scoring systems were applied to all patients, while the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), Lille and Toyama scoring systems were applied to 91 patients. The Sanz scoring system (P < 0.0001), FAB classification (P < 0.0001), IPSS (P < 0.001), and Toyama scoring system (P < 0.005) were highly predictive for survival showed greater discrimination than that of the other systems. For AML transformation, the IPSS (P < 0.0001), Toyama scoring system (P < 0.0001), FAB classification (P < 0.0001), and Lille scoring system (P < 0.005) successfully discriminated risk groups. Although the prognostic factors and the distribution of age were different from those in Western reports, the IPSS and Toyama scoring system were applicable for predicting survival and leukemic transformation in Korean patients with MDS.
