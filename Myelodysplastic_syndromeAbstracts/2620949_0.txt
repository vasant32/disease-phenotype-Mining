Thirty patients of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated over a period of 2 yr using 3 different treatment regimens. Twelve patients received hydroxyurea, 4 were given low dose cytosine arabinoside and 14 others were treated with an aggressive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) induction regimen. A low complete remission was obtained in the first 2 groups (17 and 25% respectively), whereas 9 (64%) patients attained complete remission with the AML induction regimen. Remission in the latter group was associated with prolonged and severe pancytopenia requiring intensive support. Patients in all the 3 groups had a short duration of remission culminating in death with progressive marrow failure or evolution to AML, indicating the limitations of the current treatment strategies for MDS and highlighting the need for exploring newer therapeutic approaches.
