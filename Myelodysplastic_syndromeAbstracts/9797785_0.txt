Structural chromosomal abnormalities are common in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), and complex abnormalities are known to confer a poor prognosis. Polyploidy is rare. We report a patient with MDS in whom 8/15 cells were 77,XYY; 2/15 were 83,XYY, and 5/15 were diploid (46,XY). He experienced rapid evolution of disease, transforming to terminal acute leukemia.
