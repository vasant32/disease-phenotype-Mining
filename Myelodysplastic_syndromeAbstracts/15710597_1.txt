We retrospectively compared morbidity and non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 236 adults with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome conditioned with cyclophosphamide plus oral versus intravenous busulfan. Our findings demonstrate that conditioning therapy with intravenous busulfan resulted in lower morbidity and NRM than did oral busulfan.
