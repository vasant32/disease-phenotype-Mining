Blood from 19 patients was examined for the essential antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene before, during, and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Marrow ablation and immunosuppression for BMT conditioning was achieved by treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, mostly combined with total body irradiation. All patients required total parenteral nutrition beginning 1 wk before BMT. After conditioning therapy the concentration of absolute and lipid-standardized alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in plasma decreased significantly, presumably as a result of an enhanced breakdown of these antioxidants. The loss of these lipid-soluble antioxidants has to be considered as a possible cause for early posttransplant organ toxicity.
