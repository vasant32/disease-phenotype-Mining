We applied DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining to the determination of nuclear DNA content in single megakaryocytes in 12 normal subjects and 12 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). After the megakaryocytes had been identified on Wright-Giemsa stained smear and classified according to modified Feinendegen's classification, they were photographed. Then Wright-Giemsa stain was removed by immersion in 50% ethanol at 37 degrees C for 1 h and 100% methanol at 37 degrees C for 1 h. The specimens were then stained with DAPI solution (DAPI 0.01 mg/ml, pH 7.4 Tris-EDTA-2Na buffer solution and 0.01 M 2-mercaptoethylamine hydrochloride mixed at the ratio of 0.5:98.5:1.0) for more than 30 min. The amount of nuclear DNA in the previously identified megakaryocytes was measured by microcytofluorometry. The maximum population of megakaryocytes ploidy was in 16N in normal subjects, 8N in 10/12 MDS patients, and 4N in the remaining two patients. These findings suggest impairment of the development of the megakaryocytes nucleus in the MDS patients.
