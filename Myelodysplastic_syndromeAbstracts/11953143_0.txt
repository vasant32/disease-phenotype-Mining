 OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical efficacy of the double autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (DAHSCT) for hematological malignancies. METHODS: 19 hematological malignant disease patients received the first AHSCT within 12 months after diagnosis. The first conditioning regimen was VP-16 or Ara-C, CTX +, TBI, nine of them received BCNU additionally. All patients received the second AHSCT in 4 to 10 months after the first AHSCT. The second conditioning regimen was VP-16 (or Ara-C), CTX +, Mel. RESULTS: All patients had rapidly hemopoietic reconstitution, the first hemopoietic reconstitution is faster than the second. There was no AHSCT related death. The median follow up duration was 1078 days. 12 of the 19 patients were still alive during the analysis. The 3-year disease-free suvival (DFS) was 63% +/- 10%. Those patients who had more blasts in bone marrow at the second AHSCT than the first AHSCT had greater probability to relapse. CONCLUSION: DAHSCT can be safety performed as an important treatment method in hematological malignancies.
