An increased incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has recently been documented in patients post-solid organ transplantation but the incidence and types of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) occurring in this patient population are not known. We identified 5 patients (3M, 2F, age 48-64 years) who developed MDS ranging from 1.8 to 25 years (median 4.2 years) post-solid organ transplantation, only 2 patients had received azathioprine. The cumulative incidence of MDS in heart and lung transplant recipients at 15 years was 0.5% and 1.8%, respectively, which is markedly higher compared to the general population. Low-risk types of MDS predominated, 3 of 5 patients are alive (median 3.9 years) since diagnosis. Deletions of chromosome 20q, which have not been previously reported in post-transplant MDS/AML, were identified in 3 cases. Our findings expand the morphologic and cytogenetic spectrum of MDS occurring post-solid organ transplantation and suggest that mechanisms beside azathioprine toxicity might be important in disease pathogenesis.
