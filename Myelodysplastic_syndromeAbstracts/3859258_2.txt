Low dose cytarabine (10 mg m-2, 12 hourly by subcutaneous injection) was used to treat four patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, two of whom had failed standard induction chemotherapy, and two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. Following treatment two patients entered complete remission (CR) and two patients had survivals of ten and 18 months in stable partial remission. All patients have died, four of progressive or recurrent leukemia, one of a treatment-related intracerebral hemorrhage, and one of lung carcinoma while in CR. Our experience, and a review of the literature, suggest that in general low dose cytarabine is well tolerated, although myelosuppression is common and thrombocytopenia can be a major problem. This form of treatment appears to offer a useful alternative to intensive induction chemotherapy in those patients in whom such treatment is usually poorly tolerated, and has the advantage of being able to be given to an outpatient.
