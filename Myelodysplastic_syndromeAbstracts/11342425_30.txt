Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an inherited bone marrow disorder with varying cytopenias and a strong predilection to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia. Previously, it was found that the percentage of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow and the in vitro colony formation from CD34(+) cells of patients with SDS were markedly reduced. For these reasons, and because apoptosis is central in the pathogenesis of bone marrow dysfunction in MDS, this study was initiated to delineate the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of the marrow failure. Eleven children with SDS were studied. Compared to normal controls, patients' marrow mononuclear cells plated in clonogenic cultures showed a significantly higher tendency to undergo apoptosis. The defect in SDS was found in patients with and without MDS. Patients showed a more prominent decrease in colony formation and increased apoptosis after preincubation with activating anti-Fas antibody. Fas expression on marrow cells from patients was significantly higher than from normal controls. The difference between patients and controls for Fas expression was also significant for the following cell fraction subpopulations: CD34(-)/CD38(-), CD34(-)/CD38(+), and CD34(+). In conclusion, SDS hematopoietic progenitors are intrinsically flawed and have faulty proliferative properties and increased apoptosis. Bone marrow failure in SDS appears mediated by increased apoptosis as the central pathogenetic mechanism. This increased propensity for apoptosis is linked to increased expression of the Fas antigen and to hyperactivation of the Fas signaling pathway.
