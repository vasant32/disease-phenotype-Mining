An immunocompromised patient, 6 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, developed extensive skin infection due to Trichophyton rubrum. Because she could not tolerate ketoconazole and was hypersensitive to griseofulvin, she received itraconazole with complete recovery within 30 days. This case demonstrates that itraconazole may be effective treatment for dermatophytosis, even in immunocompromised hosts, and that there is no cross-reactivity between ketoconazole and itraconazole.
