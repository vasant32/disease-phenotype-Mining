A 28-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of hepatosplenomegaly and granular lymphocytosis. His peripheral leukocyte count was 3,000/microliters with 43% of granular lymphocytes (GL). These GLs were immunologically phenotyped as CD2+CD3-CD4-CD8-CD16+CD56+HLA-DR+ and were found that TcR genes coding beta and gamma chains were not rearranged. Chromosomal analysis of his GLs stimulated with IL-2 showed 47 XY, +8. This patient was diagnosed as a granular lymphocyte leukemia of natural killer cell type. Blood chemistry showed elevation of serum GOT, GPT and LDH values. The fever persisted until administration of prednisolone was initiated. But 40 days after, high fever appeared again and the liver and spleen were extremely enlarged. Combined chemotherapy was then started but resulted in no effects. He died of hepatic failure on the 77th day from admission. 47 XY, +8, that has been reported in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, may be related to the pathogenesis in some cases of granular lymphocyte leukemia.
