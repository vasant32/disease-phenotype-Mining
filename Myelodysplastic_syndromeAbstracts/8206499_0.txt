Eighty eight patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were studied to determine the clinical and pathological features and the prognosis. All the patients had anemia. Neutropenia was seen in 44% and thrombocytopenia in 78% patients. The subtypes included refractory anemia in six, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts in three, refractory anemia with excess blasts in 30, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation in 32 and chronic myelomonocytic anemia in 17 patients. Forty four patients who received chemotherapy were evaluable for response. Three of the 15 patients treated with hydroxyurea achieved partial remission. Eighteen patients were treated with low dose cytosine arabinoside and complete remission was achieved in five and partial response in six patients. Aggressive chemotherapy was given to 11 patients at the onset of the illness resulting in complete remission in six and partial response in two patients. Nineteen of the 88 patients transformed to acute myeloid leukemia. The crude survival of all the patients ranged from 15 days to 22.5 months. The mortality was due to hemorrhage in 15% and septicemia in 85%. Our data reveals ineffectiveness of the current therapy and emphasizes on the need to develop newer therapeutic approaches.
