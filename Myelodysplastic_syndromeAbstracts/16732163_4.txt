Mycobacterium mucogenicum is an unusual cause of central venous catheter and wound infections in immunocompromised persons. The organism is often found in drinking water and is resistant to many disinfectants. We report a cord blood transplant recipient who developed a central venous catheter infection after the patient herself had flushed her catheter with tap water. The infection was successfully treated by removal of the central venous catheter and administration of antimicrobial therapy.
