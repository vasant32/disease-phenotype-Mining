Acquired Robertsonian translocations are considered to be very rare chromosome changes in human malignancy, and only three cases have been described. We report a dic(14;14)(p11;p11) in a patient with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) following treatment for multiple myeloma. This patient also had other complex chromosomal abnormalities. The pattern of karyotype evolution in this patient was established by a series of cytogenetic studies. The relationship of the complex chromosomal changes to MDS following treatment for multiple myeloma is discussed.
