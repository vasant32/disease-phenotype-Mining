Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome with a diverse clinical spectrum. A case of a 60 year old man with CMML who developed cardiac tamponade is reported. Cytological examination of the pericardial effusion fluid showed extramedullary haemopoiesis. Serous effusions are well recognised in association with this disease, but this seems to be the first reported case of extramedullary haemopoiesis resulting in a pericardial effusion in a patient with CMML.
