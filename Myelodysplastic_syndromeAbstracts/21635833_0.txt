Yellow plaques and papules on the skin are hallmarks of xanthomas. These are not always associated with abnormalities in lipid profiles or their associated proteins. In cases of diffuse normolipemic plane xanthomas these cutaneous findings are often associated with myelodyscrasias including monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and multiple myeloma. Such clinical presentations may indicate that an evaluation for myelodyscrasias is warranted.
