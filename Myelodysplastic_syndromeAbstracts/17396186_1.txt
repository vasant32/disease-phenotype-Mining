Sixty-one-year-old male patient with diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome and unstable angina was submitted to coronary angiography and implant of stent. His Blood cell count revealed 40,000 platelets/mm3. Coronary angiography with previous platelet transfusion showed obstruction of 80% of the right coronary artery (RCA). Following the administration of clopidogrel, the patient was submitted to another platelet transfusion and stent implantation in the RCA lesion. No bleeding was observed after the introducers removal. After 6 months, treadmill test was positive and new coronary aniography, in the same conditions, showed in-stent restenosis. This case report suggests that coronary stent implantation in patients with thrombocytopenia is a safe procedure, provided that prophylactic platelet transfusion is performed, although late restenosis may occur.
