To investigate the relationships of personal hair dye use and environmental factors to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we conducted a case-control study in Japan. A total of 111 MDS cases and 830 controls randomly selected from the residents in the same prefecture of cases using telephone directories responded to a health questionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) for ever having used hair dye was 1.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.38) and there were statistically significant trends in risk with increasing duration and number of hair dye use. Occupational exposure to organic solvents was marginally associated with the risk of MDS (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.10).
