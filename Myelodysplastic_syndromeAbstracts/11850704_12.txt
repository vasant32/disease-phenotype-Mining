The use of zanamivir in seven patients with influenza (three A and four B) post allograft is described. Inhaled zanamivir (10 mg twice daily) was continued from the diagnosis of influenza until excretion of virus ceased (median duration 15 days, range 5 to 44 days). There was no toxicity attributable to zanamivir and rapid resolution of influenza symptoms was seen. There was no mortality due to influenza in the seven patients. The good outcome of 30 previous patients with influenza post transplant is described. A randomised multicentre study would be required to demonstrate efficacy.
