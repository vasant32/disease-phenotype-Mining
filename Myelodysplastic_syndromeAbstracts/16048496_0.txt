Clinical course and cytogenetic analysis suggest that myelodysplasia (MDS) is one step in a multistep model of malignant transformation of haematopoietic stem cells to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We report a further case of MDS associated with trisomy 2, and comment on the significance of the cytogenetic abnormality, which as a sole abnormality only occurs in MDS, but is found in combination with other chromosomal abnormalities in AML. Previous reports on balanced and unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities associated with therapy related MDS and therapy related AML suggest that trisomy 2 is an early chromosomal abnormality in leukaemogenesis.
