 OBJECTIVE: The p15INK4B tumor suppressor is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinically approved DNA methylation inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, can reverse p15INK4B promoter methylation, but widespread clinical use of these inhibitors is limited by their toxicity and instability in aqueous solution. The cytidine analog zebularine is a stable DNA methylation inhibitor that has minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated zebularine effects on p15INK4B reactivation and cell growth in vitro to investigate a potential role for zebularine in treating myeloid malignancies. METHODS: We examined the specific effects of zebularine on reexpression of transcriptionally silenced p15INK4B and its global effects on cell cycle and apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. RESULTS: Zebularine treatment of AML193, which has a densely methylated p15INK4B promoter, results in a dose-dependent increase in p15INK4B expression that correlates with CpG island promoter demethylation and enrichment of local histone acetylation. We observed enhanced p15INK4B induction following co-treatment with zebularine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A. Zebularine inhibits cell proliferation, arrests cells at G(2)/M, and induces apoptosis at dosages that effectively demethylate the p15INK4B promoter. Zebularine treatment of KG-1 cells and AML patient blasts with hypermethylated p15INK4B promoters also reactivates p15INK4B reexpression and induces apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Zebularine is an effective inhibitor of p15INK4B methylation and cell growth in human AML in vitro. Our results extend the spectrum of zebularine effects to nonepithelial malignancies and provide a strong rationale for evaluating its clinical utility in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.
