The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in children with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In total, 94 consecutive pediatric patients with MDS received an allogeneic BMT from 1976 to 2001 for refractory anemia (RA) (n=25), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (n=2), RA with excess blasts (RAEB) (n=20), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) (n=14), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (n=32) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (n=1). The estimated 3-year probabilities of survival, event-free survival (EFS), nonrelapse mortality and relapse were 50, 41, 28 and 29%, respectively. Patients with RA/RARS had an estimated 3-year survival of 74% compared to 68% in those with RAEB and 33% in patients with JMML/CMML. In multivariable analysis, patients with RAEB-T or JMML were 3.9 and 3.7 times more likely to die compared to those with RA/RARS and RAEB (P=0.005 and 0.004, respectively). Patients with RAEB-T were 5.5 times more likely to relapse (P=0.01). The median follow-up among the 43 surviving patients is 10 years (range 1-25). We conclude that allogeneic BMT for children with MDS is well tolerated and can be curative.
