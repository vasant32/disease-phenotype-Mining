 PURPOSE: Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MDS patients diagnosed according to standard French-American-British criteria received a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg per day of arsenic trioxide for 5 days followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg arsenic trioxide twice weekly for 15 weeks. Patients were divided into two cohorts: lower-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System risk category low or intermediate 1) and higher-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System risk category intermediate 2 or high). Modified International Working Group criteria were used for response evaluation. RESULTS: Of 115 patients enrolled and treated in the study, 67% of patients were transfusion dependent at baseline; median age was 68 years. Most treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate. The overall rate of hematologic improvement (intent-to-treat) was 24 (19%) of 115, including one complete and one partial response in the higher-risk cohort. The hematologic response rates were 13 (26%) of 50 and 11 (17%) of 64 in patients with lower-risk and higher-risk MDS, respectively. Major responses were observed in all three hematologic lineages; 16% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients and 29% of platelet transfusion-dependent patients became transfusion independent. At data cut off, the median response duration was 3.4 months, with responses ongoing in nine patients. CONCLUSION: Arsenic trioxide treatment consisting of an initial loading dose followed by maintenance therapy has moderate activity in MDS, inducing hematologic responses in both lower- and higher-risk patients. This activity combined with a manageable adverse effect profile warrants the additional study of arsenic trioxide, particularly in combination therapy, for the treatment of patients with MDS.
