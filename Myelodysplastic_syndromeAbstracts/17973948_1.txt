Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with multilineage dysplasia (MD) is one of the four main categories of AML in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The role of bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) histology and immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of AML-MD is currently unclear. BMTBs were studied in 11 cases of AML-MD and two cases of myelodysplasia that subsequently transformed to AML. Among them, six cases showed trilineage dysplasia and seven showed bilineage dysplasia. With respect to conforming to the WHO definition of AML, documentation of an increased proportion of immature myeloid cells was possible on morphology and counting of immature cells following immunostaining with CD34, CD117 or HLA-DR antibodies. Recognition and quantification of dysplastic features in the haemopoietic lineages was made easier by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to ret40f (glycophorin C), myeloperoxidase, CD61 and/or CD42b, CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR. Based on this relatively small series of cases we show the utility of BMTB and immunohistochemistry as an aid to the diagnosis of AML-MD. This has to be seen not just in light of its utility at diagnosis, but also the role the diagnostic BMTB would play for purposes of comparison when follow-up BMTBs are submitted in this group of patients.
