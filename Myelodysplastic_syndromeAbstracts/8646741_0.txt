A case of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) French-American-British (FAB)-type M5b is described, secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which a primary clone containing a dup(1)(p22p36) and a subclone containing dup(1)(p22p36), were identified. This is believed to be a novel mutation in AML.
