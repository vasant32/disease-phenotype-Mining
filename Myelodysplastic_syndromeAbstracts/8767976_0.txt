In this paper we describe a patient, female 76 years aged, who showed typical symptomatic, haematologic and instrumental findings of polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also showed myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral signs of vasculitis, which some authors refer in association with PMR. The improvement obtained with steroidal therapy confirmed the clinical picture of case.
