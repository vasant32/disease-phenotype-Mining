Two cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with myelodysplasia are presented. Case 1 was admitted because of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Mild anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypersegmented neutrophils were observed. After the administration of trimethoprim-sulfame-thoxazole and antiretroviral therapy, pancytopenia progressed. Bone marrow (BM) showed dysplastic hematopoiesis, suggesting human immunodeficiency virus-myelopathy. Case 2 was hospitalized due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. BM specimen obtained for thrombocytopenia showed myelodysplasia similar to myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting that HIV may have an influence on hematopoietic progenitor cells.
