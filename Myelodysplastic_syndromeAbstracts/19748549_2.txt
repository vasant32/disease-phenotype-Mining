 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of cellular senescence to the progression and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed the expression of p16INK4a in bone marrow mononuclear cells or CD34(+) cells from 53 patients with MDS, 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 11 healthy controls. Additionally, We have assessed quantitatively senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining on bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS and AML patients, HL60 and SHI-1 leukemia cell lines, and healthy control cells. RESULTS: An upregulated expression of senescence-associated molecular marker p16INK4a was found in MDS compared with healthy controls, while a lower expression of p16INK4a was observed in AML compared with healthy controls. International Prognostic Scoring System score was negatively correlated with the percentage of p16INK4a-positive cells. The SA-beta-gal activity measured by mean percentage of positive cells was significantly higher in MDS cases when compared with controls. Meanwhile, percentage of SA-beta-gal-positive cells was also remarkably higher in dysplastic cells of MDS when compared to nondysplastic cells from MDS. CONCLUSIONS: These results of our present study suggested an accelerated cellular senescence occurred in MDS, and the cellular senescence may be involved in the progression and prognosis of MDS.
