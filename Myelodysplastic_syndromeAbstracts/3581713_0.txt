CFU-GM clonal growth was examined in bone marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the presence of Ara-C at 10(-8) M and 4 X 10(-8) M and the response compared to the effect on progenitors from normal subjects. Seventy-three percent of marrow cultures from patients with MDS showed colony growth below the 95% confidence limits for normal subjects in the presence of 10(-8) M Ara-C. At 4 X 10(-8) M Ara-C 43% of marrow cultures had subnormal colony growth. These results suggest that CFU-GM from patients with MDS may have a greater than normal sensitivity to Ara-C.
