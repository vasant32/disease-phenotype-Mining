The response of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells to four different hematopoietic growth factors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and stem cell factor (SCF)) and the relationship of the proliferative response of the AML cells to treatment outcome were studied. Proliferative responses were analyzed in 79 patients with de novo AML and 19 patients with AML arising from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In de novo AML, a positive proliferative response (stimulation index >2) was seen in 65 to 75% of cases. AML cells arising from MDS had a much higher incidence of proliferative response to each growth factor (79 to 90%) and a much higher level of 3H-TdR incorporation. The relationship to treatment outcome was evaluated in 79 patients with de novo AML. The patients whose leukemic cells had a positive proliferative response to any growth factor, especially IL-3 and SCF, had a poorer outcome, ie a lower complete remission (CR) rate, shorter CR duration, and shorter survival. The outcome was particularly poor in patients whose leukemic cells had proliferative responses to all four or any of the growth factors, compared to patients whose leukemic cells had no response. This increased response may be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with AML.
