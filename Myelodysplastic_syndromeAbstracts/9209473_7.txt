The results of studies from a regional cancer cytogenetics diagnostic service are reported. In a 10-year period, 1,143 marrow samples from patients with newly diagnosed leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were referred. Successful studies were completed on 992 cases (87%). Among all referred cases, the rates of detection of cytogenetically abnormal clones were 95% for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 54% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 51% for acute myeloid leukemia (ANLL), and 43% for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Of 169 cases of CML studied, 90.5% bore the standard Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), 3.55% had an unusual Ph, and 5.33% were Ph-negative. Among the 59 cases of cytogenetically abnormal MDS, common abnormalities observed were trisomy 8 and changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, and 20q-. Of the 168 abnormal ANLL, there was a strikingly non-random pattern of aneuploidy, with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 predominating. Common structural changes observed were changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, trisomy 8, rearrangements of 11q23, t(15;17), t(8;21), rearrangements of 12q13 and 3q, inversion 16, trisomy 11, Ph, trisomy 21, t(6;9) and t(1;22). The differences between adult and pediatric findings were minor, with the exception of chromosome 5 abnormalities, which were common among adults with ANLL but rare in the pediatric cases. There were 273 ALLs with abnormal cytogenetic findings. There was preferential gain of chromosomes 21, X, 14, 6, 4, 18, 17, and 10 (in decreasing order of frequency) in leukemic clones. Of the 193 ALLs with structural changes, many fell into-well-defined categories with established correlations to FAB subtypes. Common changes in ALL were rearrangements of 9p, 12p, 6q, TCR loci, 11q23, Ig loci, and 8q24, and duplication of 1q, Ph, i(17q), t(1;19), i(9q) and dic(9;12). The detailed documentation of the cytogenetic findings in this relatively large, single-institution study will likely facilitate the further characterization of rare, primary cytogenetic changes associated with leukemias and MDS. From a managed health care perspective, regional cancer cytogenetic services may be cost-effective alternatives to single-institution laboratories.
