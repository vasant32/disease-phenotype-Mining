We describe a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed disseminated infection due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). A 64-year-old man was admitted because of persistent fever that had been unresponsive to antibiotics. Bone marrow aspiration specimens showed myelodysplasia (RA), but the origin of the fever was unclear. Cytopenia worsened to a level that required transfusion of red blood cells and platelets. Repeated bone marrow examination revealed hypoplasia with hemophagocytosis. Several weeks later, photochromogenic NTM was isolated from bone marrow specimens, sputum and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid which had been obtained on admission. Antituberculosis treatment with clarithromycin markedly improved the patient's general condition and hematological abnormalities. Three months after resolution of the NTM infection, the peripheral blood monocyte count increased, the fever recurred, and the patient suddenly died of myocardial infarction. Disseminated infection with NTM has gained attention as a frequent complication of AIDS, and NTM can also be one of the pathogens causing disseminated infection in patients with MDS. In the present case, infection with mycobacteria that normally would have been digested by macrophages and would not have caused disseminated infection in a healthy individual, was probably related to the clinical features including high fever, severe pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis.
