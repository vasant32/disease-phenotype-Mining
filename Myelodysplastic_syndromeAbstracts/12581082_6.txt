Two cases of scurvy diagnosed following presentation with a purpuric rash are presented. A 44-year-old man developed scurvy as a result of poor dietary intake of vitamin C. This occurred because of a number of factors. including poor dentition, diarrhoea, depression and benzodiazepine/narcotic dependence. A 69-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome developed mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as complications of chemotherapy. This led to poor dietary intake and consequently scurvy. Both cases demonstrated specific and diagnostic cutaneous manifestations of scurvy, particularly perifollicular purpura, ecchymoses and coiled corkscrew hairs. The diagnosis was supported by specific diet history. Ascorbic acid tolerance test was used as a simple laboratory method to confirm the clinical diagnosis.
