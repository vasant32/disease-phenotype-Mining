The occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been reported after treatment with cytotoxic alkylating agent-based chemotherapy for solid tumors. We report a patient with metastatic ovarian carcinoma treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel, who developed secondary acute erythroid leukemia. The overall survival of patients with stage III and IV ovarian cancer has increased in the past decade. Monitoring of the long-term outcome of paclitaxel- and platinum-based regimens is warranted, particularly with regard to monitoring the development of secondary MDS and/or AML. The incidence and outcome of secondary leukemia in the setting of active ovarian carcinoma is reviewed.
