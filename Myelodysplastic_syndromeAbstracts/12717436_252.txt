We report here that individuals with Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) have germline mutations in PTPN11 and that somatic mutations in PTPN11 account for 34% of non-syndromic JMML. Furthermore, we found mutations in PTPN11 in a small percentage of individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Functional analyses documented that the two most common mutations in PTPN11 associated with JMML caused a gain of function.
