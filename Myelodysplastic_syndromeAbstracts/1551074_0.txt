To assess potential differences in genetic predisposition to myeloid neoplasia, we evaluated the karyotypes and reviewed results of cytogenetic studies on bone marrow specimens from six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia, and a history of solid tumor managed solely by surgical resection. Structural or numerical deletions of chromosome 5 were identified in each of four patients with abnormal marrow karyotypes. Constitutional karyotypes were normal in two patients studied with clonal marrow chromosome abnormalities. Review of previously reported cases of myeloid neoplasia following resection of solid tumors disclosed a preponderance of chromosome 5 deletions. Predisposition to specific chromosome loss may influence genetic expression of disease in solid tumor patients developing hematologic malignancy.
