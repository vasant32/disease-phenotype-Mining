We report a case of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) who showed marked neutrophilia without dysplastic features, basophilia or monocytosis. These findings diverged somewhat from the FAB criteria for aCML. The patient's erythroid cells and megakaryocytes were dysplastic. His marrow cells formed no spontaneous colonies, as shown by cell culture. The cells formed many small-sized neutrophil colonies with G-CSF stimulation. Interestingly, they formed mainly neutrophil colonies with GM-CSF stimulation. These findings were different from those of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells and chronic granulocytic leukemia cells. This aCML case showed the cytological features of myelodysplastic syndrome.
