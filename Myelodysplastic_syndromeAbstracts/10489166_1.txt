Alterations in the tumor suppressor genes p53, p16, and fhit were studied in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) samples of Indian patients. PCR-SSCP analysis showed evidence for the presence of polymorphism in fhit gene in 7 of 15 samples. We failed to get any evidence for mutation in the p53, p16, and fhit genes. These results indicate that mutational inactivation of these genes may not play a major role in the development of myelodysplastic syndrome.
