The authors compared bone marrow histological changes in 28 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 21 cases of aplastic anemia and 8 cases of hemolytic anemia. It is shown that abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) is a characteristic change in MDS. The presence of erythroblastic islands and the variance of morphology of megakaryocytes are valuable for diagnosis. The histological method for the observation of lymphoid micromegakaryocytes is not so accurate as cytological method. "ALIP" can more or less help to evaluate the prognosis of MDS. According to the histological changes, it is easy to differentiate the three types of anemia we studied.
