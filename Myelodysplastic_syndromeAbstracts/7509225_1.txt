In vitro studies may serve as a guide to clinical strategies with cytokines. In this study, marrows from 26 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were assayed for myeloid progenitor cells in agar gel. Colony stimulating activity was provided by the recombinant human colony stimulating factors granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), fusion protein (FP), c-kit ligand (KL) or GM-CSF combined with other cytokines (KL, IL-3). Decreased colony forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) were detected in most cases (69%) compared with normal controls. Neither FP nor the combination of GM-CSF + IL-3 produced more colonies than GM-CSF alone. The number of CFU-GM did not correlate with French American British (FAB) class. All marrows (7) from patients with 5q- showed augmentation of GM-CSF induced colonies with the addition of KL. In contrast, KL augmentation was noted in only 42% of other MDS marrows (p = 0.01). This in vitro result suggests that 5q- may predict a group of MDS patients with a likelihood to respond to the combination of GM-CSF + KL.
