Two elderly patients with transfusion-dependent refractory anemia due to myelodysplastic syndromes were treated with a course of low-dose subcutaneous cytosine arabinoside in an attempt to reduce their transfusion requirements. Following treatment, they required no transfusions for over six months. The treatment was well tolerated, but was associated with initial myelosuppression.
