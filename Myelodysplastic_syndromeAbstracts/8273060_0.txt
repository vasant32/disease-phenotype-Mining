We present updated results from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in adult patients who received transplants between 1985 and 1992. Of 47 patients, 36 where disease-free survivors 8-93, mean 32 months after transplantation. Of these, seven had received marrow from unrelated donors. The present treatment capacity is insufficient to cover the demand for allogeneic bone marrow transplants for Norwegian patients.
