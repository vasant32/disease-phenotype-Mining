PURPOSE: This report describes results of related or unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplants in 111 patients with treatment-related leukemia or myelodysplasia performed consecutively at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between December 1971 and June 1998, and identifies patient and treatment characteristics associated with survival and relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At transplantation, 56 patients had treatment-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 15 had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transition (RAEB-T), 23 had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 15 had refractory anemia (RA), and two had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Conditioning regimens were total-body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy for 60 patients, busulfan (BU) 14 to 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg (BUCY) for 27 patients, BU targeted to 600 to 900 ng/mL plasma steady-state concentration with 120 mg/kg CY (BUCY-t) for 22 patients, and miscellaneous chemotherapy for two patients. The donors were HLA-identical or partially identical family members for 69 patients and unrelated donors for 42 patients. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival was 8% for TBI, 19% for BUCY, and 30% for BUCY-t (P =.006). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 40% for secondary AML, 40% for RAEB-T, 26% for RAEB, and 0% for RA or RARS (P =.0009). The 5-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality after TBI was 58%; after BUCY, 52%; and after BUCY-t, 42% (P =.02). CONCLUSION: Patients at risk for treatment-related leukemia or myelodysplasia should be followed closely and be considered for stem-cell transplantation early in the course of myelodysplasia using conditioning regimens such as BUCY-t designed to reduce nonrelapse mortality.
