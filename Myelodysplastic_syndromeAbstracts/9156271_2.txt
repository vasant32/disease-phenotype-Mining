A 32-year-old male received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (alloPBSCT) for myelodysplasia from his one HLA-A antigen mismatched brother. He is alive with trilineage engraftment and without active GVHD 200 days after transplant. In July 1986 he underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation for viral cardiomyopathy and has received continuous immunosuppressive therapy. A post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder with Hodgkin-like histopathology was diagnosed in August 1993 and was successfully treated with four cycles of MOPP chemotherapy. Due to persistent pancytopenia he underwent a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in May 1996 which revealed monosomy 7 and morphologic changes compatible with myelodysplasia. This is the first report of a cardiac transplant recipient receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
