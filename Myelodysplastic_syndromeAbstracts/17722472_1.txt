 INTRODUCTION: Angiogenesis is an element of physiological and some pathological processes. Recently various investigators have reported that angiogenesis is associated not only with solid tumors but also with hematological malignancies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess angiogenesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have measured bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) in 43 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and in 10 subjects of group control--10 lymphoma patients (their bone marrow was free of disease). It was estimated by immunohistochemical method using anti-CD31 and anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies. In 14 MDS patients and 6 healthy donors we also measured serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunoenzymatic method. RESULTS: Higher MVD numbers were found in MDS patients when compared to control bone marrows. The highest number of MVD was in RAEBt and CMML MDS subtypes according to FAB. There was no correlation between MVD and biological features of MDS patients except for the age (negative correlation). Bone marrow microvessel density does not influenced significantly on overall survival. The serum VEGF concentration in MDS patients was higher than in healthy donors, but the difference was not statistically significant. The VEGF levels did not correlate with MVD. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that angogenesis is enhanced in bone marrow MDS patients though its mechamism is not yet fully understood.
