 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacies and toxicity of HAG (HHT + Ara-C + G-CSF) regimen in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: A total of 97 patients with high-risk MDS received HAG regimen as the induction therapy. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate of all the patients was 52.3% (45/86). The overall response (OR) rate was 66.3% (57/86). The early mortality rate was 9.3% (9/97). There was no significant difference in CR rate and OR rate between the patients aged â‰¥ 60 and those < 60. The OR rate was 29/34, 9/12 and 6/13 in patients with favorable karyotype, intermediate karyotype and unfavorable karyotype respectively. The OR rate was higher in patients with favorable karyotype than those with unfavorable karyotype (P = 0.038). The major adverse effect was infection. CONCLUSION: HAG regimen provides higher CR rate and OR rate for patients with high-risk MDS.
