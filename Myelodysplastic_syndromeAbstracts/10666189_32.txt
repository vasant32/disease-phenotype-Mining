We carried out bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 50 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who were 55.3 to 66.2 years of age (median, 58.8 years). According to the criteria of the French-American-British (FAB) classification, 13 patients had refractory anemia (RA), 19 had RA with excess blasts (RAEB), 16 had RAEB in transformation or acute myelogenous leukemia (RAEB-T/AML), and 2 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). According to the recently established International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), available for 45 patients, 2 patients were considered low risk; 14, intermediate 1 risk; 19, intermediate 2 risk; and 10, high risk. Conditioning regimens were cyclophosphamide (CY) (120 mg/kg of body weight) plus 12-Gy fractionated total-body irradiation (FTBI) (n = 15), CY plus FTBI with lung and liver shielding (n = 4), busulfan (7 mg/kg) plus FTBI (n = 4), or busulfan (16 mg/kg) plus CY (n = 27). The busulfan-plus-CY group included 16 patients in whom busulfan was targeted to plasma levels of 600 to 900 ng/mL. In these 16 patients, steady-state levels of busulfan actually achieved were 714 to 961 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, 845 +/- 64 ng/mL; median, 838 ng/mL). The donors were HLA-identical siblings for 34 patients, HLA-nonidentical family members for 4, identical twins for 4, and unrelated volunteers for 6. All 46 patients surviving > 21 days had engraftment, and 22 patients (44%) are surviving 9 to 80 months after BMT. Specifically, among 13 patients with RA, 1 had relapse (cumulative incidence [CI] at 3 years, 8%) and 8 are surviving, for a Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate of survival at 3 years of 59% (disease-free survival [DSF], 53%). Among 19 patients with RAEB, 3 had relapse (CI at 3 years, 16%), and 8 are surviving disease free (KM estimate at 3 years, 46%). Among 18 patients with RAEB-T/AML or CMML, 6 had relapse (CI at 3 years, 28%), and the KM estimate of DSF at 3 years is 33%. Relapse-free survival had an inverse correlation with cytogenetic risk classification and with the risk score according to the IPSS. Survival in all FAB categories was highest among patients enrolled in a protocol in which busulfan plasma levels were targeted to 600 to 900 ng/mL. These data indicate that BMT can be carried out successfully in patients with MDS who are older than 55 years of age. (Blood. 2000;95:1188-1194)
