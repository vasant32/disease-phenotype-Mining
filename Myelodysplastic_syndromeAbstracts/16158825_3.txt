We report the results of unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning in 3 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (MDS-RA). All patients were treated with total body irradiation, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and cyclophosphamide, followed by unrelated HLA-mismatched CBT. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was infused continuously, starting 12 hours before Ara-C therapy and continuing until the end of Ara-C therapy. All patients received standard cyclosporine and methotrexate therapy as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. All patients had myeloid reconstitution, and the times to reach an absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10(9)/L were 23, 20, and 26 days. All patients showed full donor chimerism at the time of the first bone marrow examination (on day +42, +43, and +62) after CBT. All patients are alive and free of disease at between 17 and 39 months after CBT. These results suggest that adult MDS-RA patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.
