The mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), defensin and G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) in bone marrow cells of normal individuals and myeloid disorders, with or without in vitro stimulation by myeloid cell growth factors, i.e. G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3, were examined as markers for myeloid cell differentiation in both mononuclear cell (MNC) and polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) fractions. Without any stimulation, ALP mRNA was expressed only in PMNs, G-CSFR mRNA in PMNs were expressed stronger than in MNCs; both MPO and defensin mRNA were expressed to the same degree in both fractions. With stimulation, the ALP mRNA expression in both fractions was strongly enhanced by G-CSF, but the expression was inhibited by GM-CSF and/or IL-3. MPO mRNA expression was stimulated by G-CSF and/or GM-CSF in MNCs. G-CSFR mRNA expression was enhanced by G-CSF in both fractions. Defensin mRNA expression was inhibited by G-CSF. In cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelogenous leukaemia which display a suppressed maturation of myeloid cells, our results demonstrated an almost normal response to these growth factors. Our results suggest that studies on these myeloid marker mRNA expressions would provide more knowledge about the differentiation state and cytokine reactivity of myeloid cells in normal individuals as well as various disorders.
