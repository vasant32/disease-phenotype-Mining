Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are associated with several myeloid malignancies. We have analyzed the structure of the del(20q) in 30 patients and two cell lines. Twenty-one of the patients presented with a myeloproliferative disorder and nine with a myelodysplastic syndrome. Two categories of deletions were identified. Eighteen patients had a large deletion with loss of both G(+) bands from the long arm of chromosome 20. Twelve patients had small deletions with loss of one G(+) band from the long arm of chromosome 20. A chromosome paint was generated from a del 20q marker carrying a small deletion. This probe was hybridized to normal metaphases (reverse chromosome painting) and also to metaphases from patients with a del 20q (comparative reverse chromosome painting). All six small deletions analyzed were characterized by loss of the proximal G(+) band (q12) and retention of the distal G(+) band (q13.2). These data define a minimal deleted region extending from 20q11.2-20q13.1.
