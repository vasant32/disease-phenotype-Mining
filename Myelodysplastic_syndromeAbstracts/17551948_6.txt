We have identified a novel fusion partner of MLL, namely the mastermind like 2 (MAML2 gene), in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with inv(11)(q21q23). RT-PCR and sequencing revealed that exon 7 of MLL was fused to exon 2 of MAML2 in the AML and MDS cells. The inv(11)(q21q23) results in the creation of a chimeric RNA encoding a putative fusion protein containing 1,408 amino acids from the NH2-terminal part of MLL and 952 amino acids from the COOH-terminal part of MAML2. The NH2-terminal part of MAML2, a basic domain including a binding site of the intracellular domain of NOTCH, was deleted in MLL-MAML2. MLL-MAML2 in secondary AML/MDS and MECT1-MAML2 in mucoepithelioid carcinoma, benign Wartin's tumor, and clear cell hidradenoma consist of the same COOH-terminal part of MAML2. A luciferase assay revealed that MLL-MAML2 suppressed HES1 promoter activation by the NOTCH1 intracellular domain. MAML2 involving a chimeric gene might contribute to carcinogenesis in multiple neoplasms by the disruption of NOTCH signaling.
