A patient with refractory relapsed Hodgkin's disease underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in July 1987 and achieved remission of Hodgkin's disease. He had complete hematological recovery but developed pancytopenia 3 years post bone marrow transplantation with morphological evidence of myelodysplasia. High-dose cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, chemotherapy followed by an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a HLA-matched sibling was performed in April 1991 with complete hematological recovery. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was thus used successfully to treat a potential complication of autologous bone marrow transplantation.
