Amplification or duplication of the AML1 gene at chromosome band 21q22 was detected by FISH using a locus-specific probe in three out of 171 unselected patients with therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) or t-AML (1.7%). In two patients AML1 signals were located tandemly on derivative chromosomes, in one patient on a dic(9;21) and in the the other patient on a derivative chromosome 18 made up of interchanging layers of material from chromosomes 9, 14, 18, and 21. In the third patient three single supernumerary copies of AML1 were located on derivatives of chromosomes 19 and 21. All three patients were older, had previously received therapy with alkylating agents without topoisomerase II inhibitors, had complex karyotypes including abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, and presented acquired point mutations of the TP53 gene. No point mutations of the AML1 gene were observed. The results support a pivotal role of impaired TP53 function in the development of gene amplification or duplication in t-MDS and t-AML.
