Cytogenetic and clinical data of 11 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes and partial or total trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1 are presented. In eight of these patients trisomy 1q was the sole karyotypic change and therefore can be classified as a primary chromosome anomaly. A remarkably young median age of 36.5 years was noticed in this patient group.
