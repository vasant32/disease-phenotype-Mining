The presence of cytogenetic aberrations on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients is controversial. The aim of the study is to characterize bone marrow (BM) derived MSC from patients with MDS using: kinetic studies, immunophenotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and genetic changes by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). In all 36 cases of untreated MDS were studied. MDS-MSC achieved confluence at a significantly slower rate than donor-MSC, and the antigenic expression of CD105 and CD104 was lower. Array-CGH studies showed DNA genomic changes that were proved not to be somatic. These results were confirmed by FISH. To confirm that genomic changes were also present in freshly obtained MSCs they were enriched by sorting BM cells with the following phenotype: CD45(-)/CD73(++)/CD34(-)/CD271(++). They also showed genomic changes that were confirmed by FISH. To analyze the relationship of these aberrations with clinical-biological data an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed, two clusters were identified: the first one included the 5q- syndrome patients, whereas the other incorporated other MDS. Our results show, for the first time that MSC from MDS display genomic aberrations, assessed by array-CGH and FISH, some of them specially linked to a particular MDS subtype, the 5q- syndrome.
