We present a 26-year-old patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Initial bone marrow cytogenetics with G-banding showed a rearranged chromosome 21, which was dicentric and bisatellited on CBG- and NOR-banding. Fluorescence in situ hybridization helped to characterize the structure, using a whole chromosome 21 paint and the locus specific AML1 gene probe. The rearranged 21 consisted solely of chromosome 21 material, contained only one copy of AML1, and was not a trisomy, but a deleted tandem translocation. The MDS transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the patient died almost 12 months post-diagnosis. Cytogenetics was performed three times during the course of the disease, and the dicentric chromosome 21 was present throughout. Although there are a number of published rearrangements of chromosome 21 in MDS and AML, most are isodicentrics. We could not find another case of an abnormal chromosome 21 with the same structure as reported here.
