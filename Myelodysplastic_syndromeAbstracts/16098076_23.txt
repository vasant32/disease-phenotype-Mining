In a phase I-II study for patients aged 55-65 years, we employed radioimmunotherapy using an anti-CD-66 antibody as part of a dose-reduced conditioning regimen, which was followed by a T-cell-depleted graft. 20 patients with a median age of 63 years suffering from acute leukaemia (n=17) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=3) received the antibody labelled either with 188Rhenium (n=8) or with 90Yttrium (n=12) during conditioning. Radioimmunotherapy provided a mean dose of 21.9 (+/-8.4) Gy to the bone marrow with a significantly higher dose when 90Yttrium was used. Additional conditioning was fludarabine-based plus anti-thymocyte globulin in matched related donor transplants (n=11), or plus melphalan in matched unrelated donor transplants (n=9). Regimen-related toxicity was low, with two patients developing three episodes of grade III organ toxicity. All patients engrafted, grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was observed in one patient (5%) and chronic GvHD in three patients (15%). The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 25%, the cumulative incidence of relapse 55%. The probability of survival was estimated to be 70% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years post-transplant, although no plateau was reached afterwards. In conclusion, radioimmunotherapy using the anti-CD66 antibody was feasible and safe in our elderly patient group and provided a high marrow dose.
