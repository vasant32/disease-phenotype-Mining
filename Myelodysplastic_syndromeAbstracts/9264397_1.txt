A 20-year-old Japanese man was referred because of severe pancytopenia with 14% of abnormal blasts in hypocellular bone marrow. After treatment by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and transfusions of red blood cells, spontaneous remission was subsequently achieved. After 3 months' remission, however, the patient developed AML characterized by the abnormal karyotype: 46XY,+8,t(9;11)(p22;q23). FISH study revealed the presence of trisomy 8 clone also in the hypoplastic state. While MLL-AF9 chimeric mRNA was observed in leukemic cells, it was not detectable in bone marrow cells from the hypoplastic state by RT-PCR. This is the first report of a trisomy 8 clone which evolved into one with a MLL gene rearrangement.
