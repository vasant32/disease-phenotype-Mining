Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a potent mediator of growth and differentiation of cells of several hematopoietic lineages. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow cells. By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized the IL-4 and IL-5 genes to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, the IL-4 and IL-5 genes were found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of four patients with refractory anemia (RA) or therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL), who had a del(5q). Thus a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-4, IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF as well as other genes such as CD14 and EGR1. Our findings that each of these genes was deleted in the 5q- chromosome suggest that loss of function of one or more of these genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders associated with a del(5q).
