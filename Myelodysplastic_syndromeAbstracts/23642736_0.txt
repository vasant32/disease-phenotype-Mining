The increased LSC in MDS has correlation with the progression to AML, which the mechanism of immune evasion is unclear. Our study showed the expression of CD47 on LSC of the patients in high-risk MDS based on IPSS/WPSS score was higher than that of in low-risk MDS and controls. The level of CD47 on erythroblast of MDS patients had a significant positive correlation with their peripheral RBC count. It suggested that the proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD47(+) cells increased in high-risk MDS which might protect LSC from avoiding phagocytosis, and low-expression of CD47 on erythroblast in MDS might be correlated to anemia.
