SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 (U2AF1) are the three most frequent genes involved with spliceosome mutations in myeloid malignancies. SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance. SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both MDS and myelofibrosis. In this study of 226 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R). These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation. The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P < 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) deaths and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented. OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and LFS (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively. We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in CMML but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant.
