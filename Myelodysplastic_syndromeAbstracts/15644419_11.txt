The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) transmits signals for proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. Here we report on the identification of a rare single nucleotide polymorphism within its intracellular domain (G-CSF-R_Glu785Lys). Screening a cohort of 116 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (84 patients), as well as 232 age- and sex-matched controls revealed a highly significant association of the G-CSF-R_785Lys allele with the development of high-risk MDS as defined by more than 5% bone marrow blasts (9.7% versus 0.9% in controls; P = .001; odds ratio [OR], 12.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-58.9) or an International Prognostic Scoring System score of intermediate-2 or high (13.0% versus 0.9%; P < .001; OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.4-85.0). Functional analysis by retroviral transfer of G-CSF-R_785Lys into myeloid progenitor cells of G-CSF-R-deficient mice showed a significantly diminished colony-formation capacity after G-CSF stimulation as compared with cells transduced with the wild-type receptor. These results suggest that lifelong altered G-CSF response by the G-CSF-R_785Lys may render individuals susceptible to development of high-risk MDS.
