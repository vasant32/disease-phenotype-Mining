Two years after a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from his haploidentical mother, a 28-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALI.) developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with monosomy 7 in his female bone marrow cells. Follow-up cytogenetic studies, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed twenty-seven and thirty-one months post-BMT consistently showed a female chromosome pattern with monosomy 7. Thirty-six and thirty-nine months post-BMT, further clonal evolution occurred, with the appearance of a sideline of the female cells that first expressed a del(10)(p11.2) and then developed a translocation, t(10;21)(p11.2;q22), in addition to the monosomy 7. Cytogenetic monitoring of this male patient helped to reveal a rare case of early MDS in transplanted donor cells and evolution of the acquired abnormal clone by identifying chromosomal alterations in the donated female bone marrow cells.
