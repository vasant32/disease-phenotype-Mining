In a randomised multicentre trial a combination of methylprednisolone, vincristine, lomustine, cyclophosphamide and melphalan (MOCCA) was compared with the same regimen omitting methylprednisolone after the first course (COLA) in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma. The MOCCA arm showed a response rate of 72% among 79 patients and the COLA arm a response rate of 60% among 59 patients. This difference was not statistically significant. The median survival time was 56 months in the MOCCA arm and 61 months in the COLA arm. There was a slight increase of early deaths (within the first 6 months) in the MOCCA arm as compared with the COLA arm. We conclude that, in multidrug therapies, the continuation of corticosteroid at conventional dosage beyond the first course does not improve response rate or survival time in multiple myeloma.
