We have identified a group of previously not reported chromosome abnormalities related to myeloid hematological malignancies. Cases 1 and 2 were observed to have an additional i(4)(p10) as the sole anomaly with similar clinical features of myeloid disorders; that is, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL-M2) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-refractory anemia with an excess of blasts in transformation, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies with the use of a 4p-specific microdissection probe further confirmed the presence of an i(4)(p10) in these patients. Case 3 was diagnosed with ANLL-M1 and had an additional i(8)(p10) as the only change, also confirmed by a whole-chromosome painting procedure. In cases 4-6, deletions of 18q at breakpoints q12, q23, and q21 were identified as the sole anomaly in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), MPD, and MDS, respectively. X-autosome translocations other than t(X;10)(p11;p11) and t(X;11)(q13;q23) have not been reported as recurrent or primary changes in hematological disorders. In the present study, a t(X;9)(q26;q22) and t(X;5)(q13;q33) as the sole anomaly were found in cases 7 and 8, respectively. Both cases had the same diagnosis of MDS. Considering that trisomies 4 (+4) and 8 (+8) are common anomalies in MDS and ANLL, our findings strongly indicate that amplification of genes on 4p and 8p, but not on 4q and 8q, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MDS and ANLL. In addition, genes on 18q12-23 and on Xq13-26 may be involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders.
