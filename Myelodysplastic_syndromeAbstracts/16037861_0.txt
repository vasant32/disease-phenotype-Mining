Decitabine, a potent DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which was originally under development by Pharmachemie, is being developed by SuperGen. Pharmachemie had been studying decitabine in phase II clinical trials for several leukemia indications in Europe and the US. Preliminary results indicated that the compound was active in the treatment of myelodysplasia, relapsed leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and postallogeneic progenitor cell transplant relapse. The compound is in phase II clinical trials with phase III trials scheduled to begin shortly. Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome in a total of 125 patients, with an overall response rate of 49%. In a study using decitabine to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in 81 patients, a response rate of 62% among patients in chronic phase of the disease was achieved. In a phase I/II trial designed to establish safety and efficacy in the treatment of sickle cell anemias treatment with decitabine generated a response in 100% of the patients tested: a total of eight patients were enrolled, each experienced elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin. Side effects were minimal and the drug was well tolerated. Plans for additional clinical studies of decitabine as a treatment for sickle cell anemia are underway. A phase II trial using a low dose of decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome has been completed. Of 66 patients entered, 62 were evaluable. The response rate was 48%, with a median response duration of 40 weeks. The mean survival from the start of therapy was 13 months. In a study with 37 CML patients, a 25% overall response rate was seen in those patients in the blastic phase of the disease, and a 52% response rate was observed in the accelerated phase patients. The most significant side effect was prolonged myelosuppression. The drug suppresses cellular growth in seven human tumor cell lines, possibly by reactivation of certain growth suppressor genes.
