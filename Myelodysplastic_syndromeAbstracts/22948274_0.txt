Morphology is the basis of the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The WHO classification offers prognostic information and helps with the treatment decisions. However, morphological changes are subject to potential inter-observer variance. The aim of our study was to explore the reliability of the 2008 WHO classification of MDS, reviewing 100 samples previously diagnosed with MDS using the 2001 WHO criteria. Specimens were collected from 10 hospitals and were evaluated by 10 morphologists, working in five pairs. Each observer evaluated 20 samples, and each sample was analyzed independently by two morphologists. The second observer was blinded to the clinical and laboratory data, except for the peripheral blood (PB) counts. Nineteen cases were considered as unclassified MDS (MDS-U) by the 2001 WHO classification, but only three remained as MDS-U by the 2008 WHO proposal. Discordance was observed in 26 of the 95 samples considered suitable (27 %). Although there were a high number of observers taking part, the rate of discordance was quite similar among the five pairs. The inter-observer concordance was very good regarding refractory anemia with excess blasts type 1 (RAEB-1) (10 of 12 cases, 84 %), RAEB-2 (nine of 10 cases, 90 %), and also good regarding refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (37 of 50 cases, 74 %). However, the categories with unilineage dysplasia were not reproducible in most of the cases. The rate of concordance with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia was 40 % (two of five cases) and 25 % with RA with ring sideroblasts (two of eight). Our results show that the 2008 WHO classification gives a more accurate stratification of MDS but also illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing MDS with unilineage dysplasia.
