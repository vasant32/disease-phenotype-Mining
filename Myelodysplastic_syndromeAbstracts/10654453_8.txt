We scored absolute numbers of circulating CD34+ cells by a highly sensitive triple-color flow cytometric analysis using CD45 monoclonal antibody, CD34 monoclonal antibody and propidium iodide. Forty-one patients with MDS (RA: 27, RARS: 1, RAEB: 6, RAEB-t: 3,CMML: 4), 12 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and 36 age-adjusted normal subjects were studied. RA had significantly decreased numbers of cells expressing CD34 (0.21 +/- 0.29 x 10(6)/l) compared with normal subjects (0.81 +/- 0.36 x 10(6)/l)(P < 0.001). This low number of CD34+ cells in RA resembles the case of AA (0.39 +/- 0.73 x 10(6)/l). In light-scatter analysis, the CD34+ cells of RA patients were distributed mainly in low forward scatter (FSC) (lymphocyte region). In contrast, the CD34+ cell counts were extremely high in patients with RAEB (46.54 +/- 71.37 x 10(6)/l) and RAEB-t (57.00 +/- 52.36 x 10(6)/l) (P < 0.001) and the CD34+ cells were observed in high FSC (blast region).CMML patients showed moderately increased numbers of CD34+ cells (3.69 +/- 4.64 x 10(6)/l). Thus, there was a distinct difference in cell size and number of circulating CD34+ cells between RA and RAEB/RAEB-t. In univariate and multivariate analysis, a high CD34+ cell count (> or = 1.0 x 10(6)/l) was a poor prognostic factor. This method allows one to distinguish RA from other MDS subtypes more reliably than by morphology alone and provides early signs of progression to acute leukemia.
