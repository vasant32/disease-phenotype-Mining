Minimal diagnostic criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include constant cytopenia recorded for at least 6 months, dysplasia, and exclusion of other causes of cytopenia and dysplasia. However, there are patients with dysplastic bone marrow features with or without a karyotype, who have only mild if any cytopenia. This condition has been termed idiopathic dysplasia of unknown significance (IDUS). Out of a series of 1,363 patients with suspected MDS or mild cytopenia seen between 1997 and 2010, we have identified 10 patients with IDUS, and analyzed their clinical course and outcome as well as features potentially involved in disease-evolution. Follow-up ranged between 2 and 13 years. Progression to an overt myeloid neoplasm was observed in 4 patients: two progressed to frank MDS, one to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and one to a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm exhibiting 5q-and JAK2 V617F. Consecutive studies revealed that most IDUS patients have an adequate production of erythropoietin (EPO) and sufficient numbers of EPO-responsive erythroid progenitors, features rarely seen in MDS. The erythropoiesis-promoting JAK2 mutation V617F was only detectable in one case. We hypothesize that the dysplastic clone in IDUS cannot manifest as frank MDS because i) the clone retains responsiveness against EPO, and ii) an adequate EPO-production counteracts anemia. Evolution of IDUS to low risk MDS may thus depend on the biological properties of the clone as well as patient-related factors such as EPO production. The latter often decreases with age and may thus explain why MDS often manifests in the elderly.
