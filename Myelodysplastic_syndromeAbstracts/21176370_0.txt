This study was aimed to investigate the expressions of multiple cytokines on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and its significance. The semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of IL-1β, SCF, G-CSF at mRNA level in bone marrow MSC of patients with AA and MDS. The real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) technique was used to detect the mRNA expression of TPO in bone marrow MSC of AA and MDS patients. The results indicated that the expression of SCF in AA group was much lower than that in the normal control group (p < 0.05), and the expression of TPO in AA group was higher than that in the normal control group (p < 0.05), while the expression of IL-1β of AA had no significant difference when compared with the normal control group (p > 0.05). Compared with normal control group, the expressions of SCF of MDS patients was lower (p < 0.05), but the expressions of IL-1β and TPO did not show significant difference (p > 0.05). The expressions of IL-1β, SCF and TPO were no significant difference between AA and MDS groups (p > 0.05). Neither the AA patients, MDS patients nor the normal control group had the expression of G-CSF. It is concluded that the expression of SCF and TPO in bone marrow MSC of AA patients are obviously abnormal, the expression of SCF is also abnormal in bone marrow MSC of MDS patients.
