Linezolid (LZD) is the first oxazolidinone antibiotic that is effective against drug-resistant gram-positive organisms. Hematological toxicities such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukocytopenia are common in LZD therapy. However, LZD-induced pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is very rare. A 56-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-matched and ABO blood type-matched unrelated male donor. He had bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis after engraftment of neutrophils and red blood cells. We first administered vancomycin, but then changed to intravenous LZD because of kidney damage. Two weeks after LZD therapy, the patient's hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels were 6.8 g/dL and 0.3%, respectively. Bone marrow examination revealed red blood cell aplasia (myeloid/erythroid ratio was 402). The patient showed rapid recovery of normal erythropoiesis within 2 weeks of LZD cessation. It is important to be aware of the hematological effects associated with LZD in the setting of stem cell transplantation,particularly for those with pre-existing myelosuppression, renal insufficiency, and those receiving concomitant drugs that produce bone marrow suppression. We advocate that a reticulocyte count be performed periodically for detecting bone marrow suppression, including PRCA, during LZD therapy.
