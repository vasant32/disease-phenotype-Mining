An increasing amount of data provides strong evidence for the complex multifactorial control of primary hemopoietic functions. Here we present a new multicellular functional unit, the Hematon, isolated from the light-density floating fraction of normal human bone marrow (BM) aspirates. The Hematon is organized in a compact, three-dimensional spheroid complex from central adipocytes, fibroblastoid cells, and resident macrophages that compartmentalize myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and their progenies. The Hematon fraction is more than twofold more abundant in progenitor cells when compared to the mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction as gauged by cytological techniques and by analysis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) populations. Individual Hematons may produce, within 2-3 weeks, up to 50,000 hemopoietic cells of different cell lineages in organotypic microcultures. Recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) significantly stimulated the endogenous cell production of some but not all of the individually treated Hematons, indicating the heterogeneity of factor-responsive cells within the Hematon population. Comparative observations of 184 BM aspirates support the hypothesis that the presence of Hematons in a BM aspirate correlates positively with homeostatic blood cell production, because the Hematon was present in normal BM (31/40) and it was rare among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (15/53), acute myeloblastic leukemia (7/39), and chronic myelocytic leukemia (5/52). We suggest that the Hematon represents a unifying model around which the variability of fundamental BM functions and dysfunctions can be explored.
