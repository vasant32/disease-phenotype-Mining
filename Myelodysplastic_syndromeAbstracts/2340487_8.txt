Fifty-four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (35 men and 19 women aged 34-92 years) were studied cytogenetically. Bone marrow cell culture and chromosome preparation were performed according to four different protocols used in parallel: methotrexate (MTX)-synchronized or thymidine (TdR)-unsynchronized techniques, and presence or absence of 5637 conditioned medium (CM). Some patients responded better to MTX; others had better results with TdR exposure only. Use of 5637 CM generally improved quantity and quality of metaphases. A cytogenetic result was obtained in 53 cases. 60% of the patients had a chromosome abnormality. Percentage of abnormality varied from one French-American-British (FAB) subtype to the other: 62% in refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, 8/13), 50% in refractory anemia (RA, 6/12), 60% in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB, 3/5), 77% in refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T, 7/9), and 57% in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL, 8/14). Chromosome defects were subdivided into three categories: single, two, and complex defects. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities, either single or one of two or complex defects were del(5q) or monosomy 5 (13 cases), trisomy or rearrangement of chromosome 8 (eight cases), total or partial monosomy or rearrangement of chromosome 7 (eight cases), Y loss (seven cases), and del(20q) (two cases). With the exception of del(5q) in macrocytic RA, this study confirms the absence of chromosome defects specific to each FAB category of MDS. Recurrent defects in MDS are relatively limited, however, in terms of chromosomes involved and type of abnormality. Consequently, these defects, mostly of deleted type, are assumed to play a specific role in the genesis of myelodysplasia.
