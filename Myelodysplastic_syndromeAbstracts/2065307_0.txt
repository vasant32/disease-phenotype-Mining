Monosomy for chromosome 5 or a portion of the long arm is a common finding in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially when the disorder is therapy related [1,2]. If only a portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the loss is usually accomplished by interstitial deletion of various bands, most frequently q12-14 to q31-33 [3]. Occasionally monosomy for 5q is the result of a translocation between chromosome 5 and another chromosome, with the loss of the derivative chromosome that contains 5q. A previously described unbalanced translocation involves chromosome 7: [der(5)t(5;7)(q11.2;p11.2)] and appears to be a recurring abnormality in these disorders [4]. We report here one case of therapy related MDS, one case of MDS which may be therapy related, and two cases of MDS with another "variant" 5q - abnormality, namely a derivative chromosome 3 composed of most of the short arm of chromosome 5 and the long arm of chromosome 3: [der(3)t(3;5)(?p11;?p11)].
