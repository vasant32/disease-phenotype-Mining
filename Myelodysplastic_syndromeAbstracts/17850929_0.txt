INTRODUCTION: Central diabetes insipidus is most frequently reported to occur after a trauma from surgery or accident. However, between 30 and 50% of cases are considered idiopathic. It's a rare complication of myelodysplastic syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old patient presented central diabetes insipidus revealing, 17 months before, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Cytogenetics studies revealed monosomy 7. Acute myeloid leukemia appears 3 months after training rapid patient's death. DISCUSSION: Blood examination is necessary before to conclude idiopathic central diabetes insipidus. The discovery of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia implicates a rapid managing before its possible acute myeloid leukemia transformation. Indeed, prognosis of central diabetes insipidus and acute myeloid leukemia associated, in presence of monosomy 7, is very poor.
