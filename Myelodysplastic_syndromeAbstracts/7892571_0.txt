Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently encountered in elderly patients (> 65) whereas most myelosuppressive chemotherapy protocols are restricted to younger patients. We retrospectively reviewed the 21 patients older than 65 (median age: 70, range: 66-86) hospitalized in our leukemia unit for recently diagnosed AML between 1. 1. 1988 and 31. 3. 1993. 16 had de novo AML (n-AML) and 5 had AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes (s-AML). Induction therapy consisted of cytarabine and either daunorubicine or mitoxantrone at conventional dosage in 18/21 patients. Early consolidation therapy was given to 14/21 patients and consisted of m-AMSA and VP-16 in 11 of them. The response to, and toxicity from, myelosuppressive chemotherapy was different according to the type of AML. In patients with n-AML a complete remission (CR) was obtained in 63% (10/16) and only 19% (3/16) died of MCT-related toxicity. In contrast, only 1/5 patients with s-AML achieved CR while 4/5 died of toxicity. The median duration of CR was 40 weeks (range: 5-147+) and median overall survival 23 weeks (range: 1-211+), with an estimated 3-year overall survival rate of 9.5% (2/21). Overall survival of patients with n-AML was significantly longer than that of patients with s-AML (p < 0.05). Hospital stay in relation to survival time was 100% for patients with s-AML, 49% for patients with n-AML not achieving CR and 25% for patients with n-AML with CR. In conclusion, elderly patients with AML can benefit from myelosuppressive chemotherapy providing they present with de novo AML.
