An 80-year-old woman developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome with translocation (8;21), which was successfully treated with an acute myeloid leukemia oriented chemotherapy. Five years before admission she had received cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and carboplatin for endometrial cancer. The leukemia cell morphology alerted us to the possibility of the presence of t(8;21) before cytogenetic results were obtained, and AML1/ETO fusion transcript was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. She achieved complete remission after one course of idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside. She has remained in complete remission for 6 months. Our experience suggests that recognition of typical morphological features for de novo M2 acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) would be important in diagnosis of therapy related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with this translocation, which could respond to an intensive chemotherapy.
