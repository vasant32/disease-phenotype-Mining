Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)'s diagnosis is clinical and biological. We report here 80 AML with cytology and immunophenotype features to establish correlations. 21 AML1, 23 AML2, 12 AML3, 2 AML4, 18 AML5 and 3 AML6 were diagnosed by cytology. Only one case of AML0 was diagnosed by immunophenotype. Myelogysplasia is present in 29.8% cases. CD19 and CD56 expression was significantly associated to AML +t(8;21). Additionally, concomitant negativity of CD34 and HLA-DR was discrimininatif to AML3 diagnosis. Prognostic value to expression some CD needs time backwards.
