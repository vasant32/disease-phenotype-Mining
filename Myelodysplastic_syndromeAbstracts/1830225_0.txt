Thirteen patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included in this study and consented to treatment with recombinant alpha-interferon (a-IFN). These patients were subclassified: six as RAEB, one as RAEB-T and six as CMML. T-cell subsets and natural killer cells were identified in the peripheral blood with the use of monoclonal antibodies and natural killer cell activity (NKa) was assayed before, during and after a-INF treatment. The treatment schedule consisted of 2.0 MU/m2 sc t.i.w. continuously for the three months. Prior to treatment, NKa was found decreased in 11 of 13 patients as compared to that of normal individuals. Following a-IFN administration, a rise of NKa was observed in eight of the eleven patients. In those who responded, a-IFN was continued for 1 to 21 months. Alpha-IFN treatment was myelosuppressive for most of the patients, but transient increase of the number of neutrophils and platelets was observed in 3 and of the reticulocytes in one patient. Disease progression was recorded in 9/13 patients (69%) at a median time of 17.3 months. The median overall survival was 30.5 months (range 7.5 to 65+ months). No evidence of a relationship was found between the rise in Nka and the limited clinical improvement observed. Two NKa responders under continuous a-IFN treatment are in stable clinical condition for 36+ and 65+ months. The study provides only limited evidence that a-IFN may improve the clinical course of patients with MDS.
