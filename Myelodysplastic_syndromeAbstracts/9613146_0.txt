Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogenous but clonal disorder characterized by cytopenia and dysplastic features. Telomere length in MDS vary but some of them show shortened telomeres. Telomerase activity in MDS also vary but about 60% of them show slightly elevated telomerase activity. According to the disease progression of MDS, MDS patients categorize into 3 groups, i.e., (1) normal telomere length before and after disease progression, (2) short telomere length before and after progression, and (3) shortened telomere with disease progression. Telomerase change with disease progression is not obscure, indicating impairment of telomere dynamics in MDS. These observations may indicate that some MDS show telomerase upregulation possible due to telomere shortening, while the another pathway without telomerase upregulation associated with complex chromosome changes may link to the pathogenesis of MDS.
