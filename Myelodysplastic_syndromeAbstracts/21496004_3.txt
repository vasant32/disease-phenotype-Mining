MLLT11, an MLL fusion partner, is a poor prognostic biomarker for paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), adult normal cytogenetics AML, and adult myelodysplastic syndrome. MLLT11 is highly regulated during haematopoietic progenitor differentiation and development but its regulatory mechanisms have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate by transfection experiments that MIR29B directly regulates MLLT11 expression in vitro. MIR29B expression level was also inversely related to MLLT11 expression in a cohort of 56 AML patients (P<0·05). AML patients with low MIR29B/elevated MLLT11 expression had poor overall survival (P=0·038). Therefore, MIR29B may be a potential prognostic biomarker for AML patients.
