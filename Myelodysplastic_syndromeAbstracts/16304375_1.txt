Patients with "low-risk" myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are mostly treated with approaches aiming to reduce the negative consequences of ineffective hematopoiesis. Transfusion therapy should be tailored to allow adequate oxygenation and optimal quality of life, and may lead to the need for iron chelation therapy. Growth factors (erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) may induce long-lasting improvement of hemoglobin levels and does not increase the risk for leukemic transformation. Growth factors should be offered to defined subgroups of patients. Immunosuppression with anti-thymoglobulin or cyclosporine A may be an alternative for younger patients with refractory anemia (RA). The new immunomodulating compound lenalidomide, CC5013, is very active in the 5q- syndrome and is under evaluation for other low-risk MDS subtypes. "High-risk" MDS is associated with poor survival and high risk for leukemic transformation. The DNA hypomethylating compounds azacytidine and decitabine may offer improved long-term outcomes in this group of patients, although there has so far been no effect on survival rates. The efficacy of farnesyl transferase inhibitors has been evaluated in a series of phase II trials. The overall response rate was low, but the majority of responses were CRs. Finally, a number of new drugs directed to various biological and genetic targets are entering clinical trials.
