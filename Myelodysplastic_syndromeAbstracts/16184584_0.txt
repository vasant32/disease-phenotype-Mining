Using our recently developed human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene-based chimerism assay, long-term chimerism was investigated in female patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) with cells from male donors. After restriction digestion of samples, we detected a small number of female-derived cells within a large population of male-derived cells, with a sensitivity from 0.1% to 0.05%. Chimerism was examined in four patients with myeloid malignancies: two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and one patient each with AML M3 and AML M4. All patients underwent myeloablative conditioning regimens and exhibited good clinical results during a median follow-up period of 6.6 years (range, 3.4-7.5 years). Female-derived cells were detected throughout the entire follow-up period in all bone marrow samples, but they became undetectable in the peripheral blood samples of 3 patients. Moreover, the HUMARA band pattern suggests that these residual host cells were normal cells. This study confirms the usefulness of the HUMARA gene-based assay, which showed that patients undergoing HCT frequently show mixed chimerism (MC) for a long period, especially in bone marrow, although the possibility of contamination by host stromal cells cannot be excluded.
