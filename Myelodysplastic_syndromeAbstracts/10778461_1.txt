Six cases of granulocytic sarcoma are presented. A mediastinal chloroma and a tumor of the submandibular gland were observed with two patients as single sign of acute myeloic leukaemia. In one patient a chloroma appeared as first manifestation of acute myeloic leukaemia. Two patients exhibited the tumor as first symptom of a blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (femoral bone, lumbar spine). The sixth patient with a myelodyplastic syndrome showed a chloroma of the breast. Various radiological procedures were applied including plain radiography, MRT, CT and mammography. The results are compared with literature. Principles of therapy were supplemented.
