The levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured immunoradiometrically in the sera of 82 myelodysplastic (MDS) patients at diagnosis in an attempt to identify possible relationships between serum cytokine levels and clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. We found that serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly higher in the group of MDS patients than in the normal controls (p < 0.03 and p < 0.001, respectively), while serum IL-1 alpha and IL-2 levels did not differ statistically between patients and control subjects. Elevated serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were mainly seen in patients with high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS), i.e. patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), refractor anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively), or refrochopy anemia with excess of blasts in transformation to acute leukemia (RAEB-t) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with low-risk disease, i.e. patients with refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), had serum cytokine levels comparable to those of controls. Patients' serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha correlated inversely with the hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and positively with the absolute number of circulating myeloblasts (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and the proportion of bone marrow (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) myeloblasts. A negative correlation was also noted between serum TNF-alpha concentrations and patients' survival in high-risk MDS (p < 0.02). We concluded that elevated serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha values are seen mainly in patients with high-risk disease, and that high serum TNF-alpha concentrations are predictive of shortened survival in this group of patients.
