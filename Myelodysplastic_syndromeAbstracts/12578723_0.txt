Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell. Recent developments in molecular genetics have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that lead to MDS. This review summarizes the most recent developments in the understanding of the gene defects associated with MDS which mainly include altered expression of oncogenes, the loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes and the repair of DNA.
