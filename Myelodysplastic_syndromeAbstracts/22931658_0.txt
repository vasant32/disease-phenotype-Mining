This study was aimed to investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in detecting MLL-related fusion genes in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ten MLL-related genes (dupMLL, MLL-ELL, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-AF17, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AF1Q) in 221 MDS cases were detected by multiplex nested RT-PCR. The results indicated that 20 patients were detected with positive result among 221 patients and the positive rate was 9.05%. The number of the positive cases and positive rates of the above mentioned 10 fusion genes were in order: 7 (3.16%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 (0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 (10.45%). It is concluded that the multiplex nested RT-PCR has been confirmed to be able to detect 10 fusion genes in MDS patients, which can provide important evidences for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and give related necessary information about minimal residual disease and its prognosis.
