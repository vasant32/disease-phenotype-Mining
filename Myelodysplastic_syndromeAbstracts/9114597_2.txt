Cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC) was administered orally to 19 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). SPAC was administered at doses of 200-300 mg/day for more than 14 days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Four of the 12 patients with AML and 1 of the 7 patients with MDS achieved complete remission (CR) after one cycle of SPAC treatment. Especially, 3 of the 6 patients with newly diagnosed AML achieved CR. Major side effects of SPAC were myelosuppression and tolerable gastrointestinal disorders. The treatment with SPAC is a therapeutic option in elderly patients or patients with organ failure.
