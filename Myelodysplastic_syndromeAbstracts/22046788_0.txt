Agranulocytosis is an acute disease with severe leucopenia, especially with low neutrophils, elements with an essential role in the organism's defense. It is more frequent at adult age (between 30 to 70 years of age) especially in women. We present the case of a 84 years old patient that, following passive exposure to pesticides, develops a severe neutropenia with a fast response to the administration of Methylprednisolone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF-Filgrastim 48MIU/0.8mL/day, for three days). The diagnostic certainty was set by the bone marrow puncture which excluded a possible aleukemic acute leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome.
