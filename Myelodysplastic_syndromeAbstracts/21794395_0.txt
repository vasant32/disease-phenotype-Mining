Relapsing polychondritis is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by episodic inflammation of cartilaginous tissues. More rarely, it has been described as a paraneoplastic phenomenon mainly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes or other haematologic diseases. We present a case of relapsing polychondritis associated to low degree lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma whose picture was punctuated by cutaneous erythema nodosum and anterior uveitis. The clinical evolution was satisfactory with glucocorticoids and rituximab treatment.
