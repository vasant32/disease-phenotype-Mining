Transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic (MDS) patients are prone to iron overload. We evaluated 43 transfused MDS patients with T2* magnetic resonance imaging scans. 81% had liver and 16·8% cardiac iron overload. Liver R2* (1000/T2*), but not cardiac R2*, was correlated with number of units transfused (r=0·72, P<0·0001) and ferritin (r=0·53, P<0·0001). The area under the curve of a time-ferritin plot was found to be much greater in patients with cardiac iron loading (median 53·7x10(5) Megaunits vs. 12·2x10(5) Megaunits, P=0·002). HFE, HFE2, HAMP or SLC40A1 genotypes were not predictors of iron overload in these patients.
