PURPOSE: To report the appearance of birdshot retinochoroidopathy in a patient with myelodysplasia syndrome. METHOD: Case report of a healthy 62-year-old woman who was fortuitously noted to have multiple atrophic spots in the posterior choroid and retina of each eye. RESULT: Subsequent medical evaluation included a blood cell count that disclosed pancytopenia, with a diagnosis of myelodysplasia made on bone marrow examination. CONCLUSION: An autoimmune response associated with the underlying myelodysplasia may be responsible for the appearance of atrophic retinal and choroidal lesions resembling birdshot retinochoroidopathy.
