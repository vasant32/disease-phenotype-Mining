This study was aimed to dynamically observe the expression level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in MDS patients and to explore the significance of LDH level for prognostic judgement of MDS patients. The expression level of LDH in 163 confirmedly diagnosed patients from 2001 to 2009 years in our hospital, the changes of LDH level in follow-up patients and relation of the LDH changes to prognosis, survival time and MDS progression, as well as the relation of LDH level to blood cell count, ratio and karyotype of blast cells in bone marrow were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed that the median LDH level in 163 MDS patients at diagnosis was 214 U/L (range 102 - 865 U/L), the median survival time of patients with increased LDH (> 240 U/L) was 25.6 months which was significantly shorter than that of patients with normal LDH level (56.8 months)(p < 0.05). When MDS patients were classified according to IPSS, the increased LDH level in MDS patients was observed in high risk and intermediate II groups (337.20 ± 298.00 U/L and 234.07 ± 216.00 U/L, respectively) which was significantly higher than that in low risk group (154.94 ± 46.08 U/L) (p < 0.05). The LDH level in patients with MDS progression was obviously enhanced while LDH level in patients without progression was not enhanced, mainly maintained in stable level as compared with LDH level at diagnosis and before progression (p < 0.005). By multivariate analysis, the increase of LDH level was found to be an independent prognostic factor. It is concluded that the LDH level may be used as indicator for judging prognosis of MDS patients, which is helpful to early recognition of MDS progression and risk stratification of disease, as well as selection of rational therapy.
