Two cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia are reported. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical, morphologic, and cytochemical analysis. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated monosomy 5 in both patients, providing further evidence that acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is a subset of the acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and may be etiologically related to the myelodysplastic syndromes.
