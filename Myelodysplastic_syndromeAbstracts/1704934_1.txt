Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disorder of uncertain origin characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilage. A case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with relapsing polychondritis is reported. A 60-year-old man who had been diagnosed as MDS was admitted because of pain and swelling in the bilateral preauricular regions and cheek. A diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was made by coexistence of auricular chondritis, arthropathy, ocular inflammation and audio-vestibular disturbance. He also developed ocular palsies and optic neuritis. He was treated with prednisolone, azathioprine, dapsone, and then with steroid pulse therapy. Moreover, plasmapheresis and high dose gamma-globulin therapy were undertaken. However, all these treatments were unsuccessful and he died of respiratory failure.
