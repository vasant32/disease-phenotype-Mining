Deletion of a segment of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q-) is relatively frequent in lymphoid leukemias and malignant lymphomas, but rare in myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. The possible clinical consequences of 6q deletions are unknown. We hav approached this problem by looking for relations between loss of 6q bands and clinical as well as hematological parameters in patients with hematological malignancies. We found that survival was significantly shorter and the 6-q-metaphase prevalences significantly higher when 6q23 had been deleted. No other 6q band showed non-random associations. A candidate tumor suppressor gene may be encoded in 6q23.
