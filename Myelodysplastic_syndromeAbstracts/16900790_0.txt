 BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of vincristine-laden platelet transfusion for patients with refractory thrombocytopenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty evaluable patients who received vincristine-laden platelets for refractory thrombocytopenia were included in this retrospective study. Vincristine (1 mg) was added to the platelets and incubated for one hour prior to transfusion. Serial platelet counts following vincristine-laden platelet transfusion and units of platelets transfused in the week prior to and the week after transfusion of vincristine-laden platelets were evaluated. RESULTS: The underlying diseases of the patients were lung cancer (n =4), breast cancer following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and acute myeloid leukemia (n=3 each), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2), acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, aspergillosis, cytomegalovirus infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1 each). The median rate of change of platelet count after transfusion of vincristine-laden platelets was 550/microL/day (range, -1,000 to 12,8001/microL/day; p=0.003). The median change in the number of units of platelets transfused in the week following vincristine-laden platelet transfusion was -1.5 as compared to the week prior to the transfusion (p=0.031). Patients with a primary marrow disorder exhibited no difference in either the rate of change in platelet count or in the difference in the units of platelets transfused compared to those without a primary bone marrow disorder. CONCLUSION: Vincristine-laden platelet transfusion was associated with significantly increased platelet counts and a subsequent decrease in platelet transfusion.
