Gene patterns of expression in purified CD34(+) bone marrow cells from 7 patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 4 patients with high-risk MDS were compared with expression data from CD34(+) bone marrow cells from 4 healthy control subjects. CD34(+) cells were isolated by magnetic cell separation, and high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed. For confirmation, the expression of selected genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Class membership prediction analysis selected 11 genes. Using the expression profile of these genes, we were able to discriminate patients with low-risk from patients with high-risk MDS and both patient groups from the control group by hierarchical clustering (Spearman confidence). The power of these 11 genes was verified by applying the algorithm to an unknown test set containing expression data from 8 additional patients with MDS (3 at low risk, 5 at high risk). Patients at low risk could be distinguished from those at high risk by clustering analysis. In low-risk MDS, we found that the retinoic-acid-induced gene (RAI3), the radiation-inducible, immediate-early response gene (IEX1), and the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) were down-regulated. These data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with low-risk MDS lack defensive proteins, resulting in their susceptibility to cell damage. In summary, we propose that gene expression profiling may have clinical relevance for risk evaluation in MDS at the time of initial diagnosis. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that in MDS, hematopoietic stem cells accumulate defects that prevent normal hematopoiesis.
