Flow cytometry (FC) is recognized as an important tool in the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) especially when standard criteria fail. A working group within the Dutch Society of Cytometry aimed to implement FC in the diagnostic work-up of MDS. Hereto, guidelines for data acquisition, analysis and interpretation were formulated. Based on discussions on analyses of list mode data files and fresh MDS bone marrow samples and recent literature, the guidelines were modified. Over the years (2005-2011), the concordance between the participating centers increased indicating that the proposed guidelines contributed to a more objective, standardized FC analysis, thereby ratifying the implementation of FC in MDS.
