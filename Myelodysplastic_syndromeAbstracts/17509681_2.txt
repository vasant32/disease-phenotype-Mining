Duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) has been detected accompanied with other chromosome abnormalities in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). However, as a sole karyotypic change, it is rarely observed. We present here two patients affected of a MDS that showed a dup(1)(q21q32) as a sole cytogenetic change in their bone marrow cells. Complementary methodologies confirmed the duplication of chromosome 1q and, did not show additional cryptic chromosome abnormalities. One patient acquired a secondary trisomy 8 and the other one progressed toward an acute leukemia with no additional cytogenetic alterations.
