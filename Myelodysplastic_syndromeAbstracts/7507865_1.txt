Stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand of the c-kit receptor, is a potent enhancing cytokine for haematopoietic cells in the presence of IL-3, GM-CSF and erythropoietin (Epo). In the clonogenic assays of 63 MDS patients, the addition of rh-SCF + GM-CSF and/or IL-3 induced a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the number and size of CFU-GM. Never reaching the levels of controls, this increase was seen in all FAB subtypes, but particularly in RA. There was no significant increase in cluster formation, even in RAEB or RAEBt. Rh-SCF (10 ng/ml) led to mean increases of up to 26 times in the number of Epo-dependent BFU-E colonies, particularly in RA (p < 0.001) and RAEB (p < 0.05). Individual responses varied widely (especially in RA) from no response to supranormal levels. Added to the weekly refeed of 37 MDS LTBMC, SCF (10 ng/ml) induced only a 7% mean increase in both cell output and the number of clonogenic cells recovered in the supernatant. Immunohistochemical examination of the supernatant showed significant increases in differentiating myeloid cells in all examined cases, and in erythroid cells in 3 cases; blast cells increased in only 3 cases. These data suggest that rh-SCF is capable of at least partially reversing defective MDS myeloid haematopoiesis, and leads no overt risk of leukaemic transformation. Its potent effect on erythroid cells is encouraging for future clinical applications in patients, particularly if they are selected by means of in vitro tests.
