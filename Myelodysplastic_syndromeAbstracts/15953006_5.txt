Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progresses into acute leukaemia with a variable time course. We analysed 45 newly diagnosed patients and found that the expression of the Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) had a significant impact on disease severity, progression and overall prognosis. Global or lineage-specific loss of SHP1 was observed by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsies of MDS patients who progressed rapidly (P = 0.0021) and had shorter survival (P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that SHP1 expression in megakaryocytes had prognostic relevance for time to progression (P = 0.009) and overall survival (P = 0.001).
