Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is suitable for detecting different types of chromosome aberrations on interphase nuclei even in specimens with no or few chromosome metaphases. However, it is not known why FISH is superior to conventional G-banding analysis. The sensitivity of interphase FISH was compared to that of G-banding analysis in 288 leukemia/lymphoma patients for 10 different types of chromosome aberrations: t(9;22) (M- and m-BCR), t(8;21), 11q23 abnormalities, t(15;17), del(5)/-5, del(13)/-13, +8, -7, and +12. The results revealed that t(15;17) positive cells could not proliferate well in culture, leading to underestimation of abnormality by G-banding. Monosomy 7 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as well as trisomy 12 and deletion chromosome 13 in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) were also severely underestimated by G-banding. On the other hand, no discrepancies were observed in t(8;21), t(9;22), translations involving 11q23, or in trisomy 8. These findings indicate the superiority of interphase FISH over conventional cytogenetics for detecting chromosome abnormalities in small clones, especially for monosomy 7 or (15;17) translocations.
