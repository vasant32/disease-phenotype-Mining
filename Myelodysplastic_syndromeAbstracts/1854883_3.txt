The presence of activated transforming genes was investigated in four patients with therapy-related leukemia and in three with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. DNA of bone marrow cells from six of the patients exhibited transforming activity in the tumorigenicity assay. Five of the six patients who were positive in the tumorigenicity assay contained activated N-ras oncogenes, and three contained activated K-ras oncogenes. Thus, concurrent activation of N-ras and K-ras oncogenes was observed in two patients. In vitro DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide dot-blot analysis was used to investigate mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the N-ras and K-ras oncogenes. Two patients exhibited an N-ras mutation, substituting aspartic acid (GAT) for glycine (GGT), and three patients exhibited an N-ras codon 13 mutation, substituting valine (GTT) for glycine. Two patients exhibited K-ras codon 12 mutations, substituting aspartic acid (GAT) or cysteine (TGT) for glycine (GGT), respectively, and one case exhibited a K-ras codon 61 mutation, substituting lysine (AAA) for glutamic acid (CAA). Cytogenetic analysis revealed that loss of chromosome 7 was frequent (four patients: 57%). Our data indicate that activation of N-ras and K-ras genes, as well as loss of heterozygosity for specific alleles on chromosome 7, plays a more important role in the leukemogenesis of both therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
