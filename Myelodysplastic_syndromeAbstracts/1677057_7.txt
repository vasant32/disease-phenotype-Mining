The expression of the P-glycoprotein which is associated with the development of multidrug resistance in various cell lines was investigated in 87 fresh acute leukaemia and multiple myeloma samples using the specific mouse monoclonal antibody MRK16 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Considering a 10% positive cell cut-off value, a heterogeneous expression of P-glycoprotein was observed in 5/22 (22.7%) de novo acute leukaemias, 7/22 (31.8%) relapse or secondary acute leukaemias, 14/27 (51.8%) acute transformation of myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes and 5/16 (31.2%) multiple myelomas. This expression was not associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, especially alterations of chromosome 7q. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, has been demonstrated to circumvent the multidrug resistance in cell lines, possibly by interfering with P-glycoprotein function. Using the microculture tetrazolium assay, verapamil was demonstrated to increase the sensitivity of fresh leukaemic or myeloma cells to doxorubicin in 19/43 (43.1%) samples. The doxorubicin IC50 level and the capacity of verapamil to increase the sensitivity of blast cells to doxorubicin in vitro did not correlate with the expression of P-glycoprotein. We conclude that high non-cytotoxic concentrations of verapamil were able to increase the in vitro doxorubicin sensitivity of fresh acute leukaemia and myeloma cells without detectable expression of the P-glycoprotein.
