Busulfan is an alkylating agent currently used in the myeloablative conditioning regimen before stem cell transplantation. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, nor the reason for its narrow therapeutic window. We studied the pharmacodynamics of busulfan in an in vitro cell line model, allowing us to evaluate the effects of various doses and exposure times on clonogeneic capacity, proliferation and apoptosis. Cells were incubated with busulfan in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 microg/ml for 2, 4 or 8 h, then washed and cultured in busulfan-free medium for 72 h. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated by using the trapezoidal rule from different concentrations and times of incubation. In all assays busulfan affected the cells in an AUC-dependent manner. Induced changes in the biological parameters studied appeared at different time points after exposure to busulfan stopped. Thus, the decrease in proliferation and clonogenic capacity preceded cell cycle arrest in G2 phase and development of apoptosis, implying that apoptosis is a secondary event to interruption of vital metabolic processes. Biochemically, apoptotic changes were typical for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis with caspase activation, cleavage of Bcl-2 and PARP proteins, while cleavage of actin was not observed. Cells were rescued from apoptosis with a general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, but not with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Our results add new information about busulfan pharmacodynamics and mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of the drug.
