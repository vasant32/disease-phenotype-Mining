A 73-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a 2-year history of repeated painful edematous erythemas on the skin and pancytopenia for the last 8 months. FDG PET/CT demonstrated multiple cutaneous foci with increased tracer accumulation throughout the body, multiple FDG-avid lymph nodes in the mediastinum, bilateral pulmonary hili and abdomen, and diffusively increased FDG uptake of bone marrow. A skin biopsy revealed infiltration by neutrophilic granulocytes consistent with Sweet syndrome. Myelodysplastic syndrome was established on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
