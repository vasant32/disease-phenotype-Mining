 BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that, among other factors, comorbidity may be an important prognostic variable in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who are eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the overall survival (OS) and underlying risk factors in 45 adult patients with MDS (n = 38), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 1), or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) arising from MDS (n = 6), who underwent allogeneic SCT at our Institution. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 37 months, OS for all patients was 23%, post-transplant relapse occurred in 11 patients, and 10 patients died from treatment-related complications. The overall outcome and survival was independent of cytogenetic abnormalities and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). However, we identified comorbidity as defined by the haematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as a significant adverse prognostic variable in our MDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data and similar published data we recommend selecting patients with MDS or secondary AML for SCT according to the presence of comorbidities.
