Since 2002, date of publication of the previous Italian Society of Haematology (SIE) practice guidelines for management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), novel disease-modifying treatments have been introduced and the SIE commissioned an update. After a comprehensive review of the medical literature published since January 2001, the Expert Panel formulated recommendations for the management of adult and paediatric MDS, graded according to the available evidence. The major updates are: first-line hypomethylating agents in patients with INT2-high-risk disease; controlled use of first-line lenalidomide in low-INT1 risk transfusion-dependent patients with 5q deletion; deferasirox in low-INT1 patients with a relevant transfusional load; first-line high-dose ESA in low-INT1 patients with Hb <10 g/dl and endogenous EPO <500 U/l; allogeneic HSCT first-line therapy for INT2- and high-risk patients <65 years without severe co morbidities.
