The emergence of certain skin conditions belonging to the group of mucocutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes may indicate the future appearance of a previously unknown malignancy. Sweet's Syndrome and relapsing polychondritis are included in this group. Sweet's Syndrome and relapsing polychondritis are very rarely found together in the same patient. This dual occurrence is more commonly found in cancer patients with associated hematological malignancies. We report the case of a 79 year-old male with Sweet's Syndrome and relapsing polychondritis, who was subsequently diagnosed with a myelodysplastic syndrome.
