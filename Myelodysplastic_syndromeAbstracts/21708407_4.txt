Population-based data on patients with MDS are scarce. Here we report the incidence and prevalence of MDS based on data from the Düsseldorf MDS Registry. Cases in the city of Düsseldorf in the study period were identified from the MDS Registry. We calculated crude, calendar-year, age- and sex-specific and European Standard Population age-standardized incidence rates as well as point prevalences per 100,000 The crude incidence rate was 4.15/100,000/year and the point prevalence per 100,000 persons of 7. We found that the incidence and prevalence of MDS was higher in men than women and increased sharply with increasing age.
