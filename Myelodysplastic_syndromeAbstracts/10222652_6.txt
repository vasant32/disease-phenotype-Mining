The paradox of peripheral cytopenias despite cellular bone marrow (BM) observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has been associated with excessive intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. Since MDS is regarded as a stem cell disorder, the present studies were undertaken to examine the relative susceptibility and propensity of early progenitor CD34+ cells to undergo apoptosis as compared to more maturing/matured CD34- cells. Five serial studies were performed on 4 independent groups of 36 newly diagnosed MDS patients. First, in 2 separate groups of 16 and 8 patients each, measurement of the extent of apoptosis in CD34+ and CD34- fractions of the BM aspirate mononuclear cells was carried out using independent biparametric flow cytometry methods, CD34 labeling/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (n = 16), and CD34 labeling/reduced uptake of nucleic acid staining dye LDS751 (n = 8). The difference in the median degrees of apoptosis in CD34+ vs. CD34- cells was not statistically significant by either technique (P = 0.583 and P = 0.674 for TUNEL and LDS751, respectively). In the next group of 4 MDS patients, a double-labeling was performed on plastic embedded marrow biopsy sections, to detect CD34 antigen with specific monoclonal antibody and apoptosis by in situ end labeling (ISEL) of fragmented DNA. Despite high overall apoptosis (56.2% +/- 18.4%), only an occasional CD34+ cell was found to be simultaneously labeled with ISEL. Finally, in the last group of 8 MDS patients, CD34+ cells were separated from CD34- cells on affinity column and cultured in serum containing medium for 4 hours. At 0- and 4-hour time points, ISEL was carried out to label apoptotic cells. In addition, a fluorometric assay was employed to estimate the activity of a proapoptotic enzyme, Caspase 3. Both the net increase in % ISEL labeled cells (apoptotic index or AI) and Caspase-3 activity were significantly lower in CD34+ cells as compared to CD34- cells (AI, 0.87% +/- 0.5% vs. 3.97% +/- 1.4%, n = 6, P = 0.028 and Caspase-3 Units/mg protein, 46.9 +/- 25.0 vs. 71.7 +/- 23.03, n = 5, P = 0.042, respectively). We conclude that when estimated in a total population of mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells and CD34- cells show comparable degrees of apoptosis. However, once separated the CD34+ fraction demonstrates lower propensity to undergo apoptosis, thereby suggesting the CD34- fraction as being a possible source for proapoptotic signaling.
