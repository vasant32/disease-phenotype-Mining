Twenty-nine adult patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and an excess of marrow blasts were treated by aggressive chemotherapy while still in MDS phase (20 cases) or after progression to ANLL (9 cases). Median age was 47.5 (range 18-68). Twenty-eight patients received a combination of Rubidazone and Ara C and 1 received High dose Ara C. Fourteen patients (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 5 (17%) were treatment failures (F) and 10 (35%) died during therapy induced aplasia (DA). Median disease free survival was 8.5 months. Median survival of the whole population was 6 months from the onset of treatment, and 17 months in patients achieving CR. These results were significantly less favorable than those obtained at our institution in de novo ANLL with the same chemotherapy regimens. No statistically significant prognostic factors of treatment outcome emerged but patients with normal cytogenetic findings seemed to have both a higher CR rate and longer remissions than patients with abnormal karyotypes. Patients under 50 did not have higher CR rates than older patients, although they had longer remissions (with 3 out of 6 CRs exceeding 2 years). Finally, treatment outcome and survival were identical in patients treated in the MDS phase and in those treated after progression to ANLL. Combination chemotherapy is a highly toxic approach in MDS and essentially seems to benefit younger patients with a normal karyotype, in whom some long remissions can be obtained.
