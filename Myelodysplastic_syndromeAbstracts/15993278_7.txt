Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 represent a common chromosomal abnormality associated with myeloid malignancies, in particular with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using G-banding cytogenetic techniques, we found clones with del(20q) in 36 patients with hematological malignancies examined in our laboratory during the years 2001-2003: in 23 patients as a sole cytogenetic aberration and in 13 patients together with other chromosomal changes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for the 20q12 region was used in all cases to confirm the presence of the clone with deletion. For patients with additional or complex chromosomal rearrangements, multicolor FISH (M-FISH) analysis was performed. Statistical evaluation of the prognostic impact of sex, age, diagnosis, and karyotype was performed. The survival time correlated with the type of chromosomal aberration; no significant differences in survival were found for sex, age, and diagnosis.
