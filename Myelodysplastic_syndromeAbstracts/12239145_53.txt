Major changes have occurred in the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during the last decade. This report reveals the changes, reflects current status, and provides medium-term projections of HSC transplantation (HSCT) development in Europe. Data on 132 963 patients, 44 165 with allogeneic HSC transplant (33%) and 88 798 with an autologous HSC transplant (67%), collected prospectively from 619 centers by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 35 European countries between 1990 (4234 HSCTs) and 2000 (19 136 HSCTs) illustrate utilization of HSCT. HSCT increased in all European countries and for all indications. There were major differences depending on disease indication and donor type. Transplantation rates (numbers of HSCTs per 10 million inhabitants) varied from less than 1 for some rare indications to 37.7 +/- 4.1 for acute myeloid leukemia in allogeneic HSCT or 95.5 +/- 13.5 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in autologous HSCT. There were indications with a steady, continuing increase and others with initial increase but subsequent decrease. Projections on medium-term development for each disease based on a weighted sensitivity analysis predict an ongoing increase in allogeneic HSCT except for chronic myeloid leukemia. In autologous HSCT they predict an increase for lymphoproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and some solid tumors but a decrease for most solid tumors, acute lymphoid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Transplantation rates can be predicted with reasonable sensitivity for most disease indications. Despite marked changes in the rapidly developing field of HSCT, this information on current use, trends, and midterm predictions forms a rational basis for patient counseling and health care planning.
