Myelodysplastic changes have recently been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The authors report a patient with AIDS-related complex and myelodysplasia who rapidly progressed to acute myeloblastic leukemia. Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) was documented by culture and by serology. Chromosome studies showed monosomy of chromosome 7 and structural abnormality of the long arm of chromosome 3. The association of HTLV-III infection with myelodysplasia and acute myeloblastic leukemia may have been coincidental in this reported case, but it is also possible that the leukemia was secondary to the HTLV-III infection. Further investigation appears justified.
