The effect of ABO-incompatibility on transplantation outcome remains a controversial issue, with many of the reported studies showing conflicting results. In this study, we evaluate: the association between ABO-incompatibility and myeloid engraftment; the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); non-relapse mortality (NRM); GVHD-associated mortality, relapse and overall survival (OS). Our study includes 221 patients with malignant diseases treated in the same institution with the same reduced intensity regimen. Other variables known to affect the transplantation outcome such as age, disease, disease risk, and donor characteristics were well-balanced between ABO-matched and ABO-mismatched transplants. Analysis of our data shows increased incidence of NRM during the first months after transplantation in the groups of patients with major and minor ABO-incompatibility. Although neither incidence nor severity of GVHD differed significantly among the different groups, we found increased mortality associated with GVHD in the major ABO-incompatible groups. Long-term OS and relapse rate were not different, although we observed a trend for decreased OS during the first year post transplantation in the group of patients with major ABO-incompatibility. Our study showed that ABO-incompatibility has an adverse impact on the transplantation outcome.
