Bone marrow cells of four patients with t(1;7) and myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia were analyzed using nonradioactive in situ hydridisation. As probes, centromeric alphoid DNA sequences of chromosomes 1 and 7, a satellite DNA probe for 1q12, and chromosome-specific libraries of chromosomes 1 and 7 were used. The breakpoints of the t(1;7)(p11;p11) as determined by banding analysis could be studied more accurately, and the recently proposed designation t(1;7)(cen;cen) was confirmed in all four cases. Colocalization of alphoid DNA sequences of chromosomes 1 and 7 by double target in situ hybridisation was demonstrated in metaphase cells and also in interphase nuclei. The in situ hybridisation method described is applicable for the screening of peripheral blood cells or archival material.
