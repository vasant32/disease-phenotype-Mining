Platelets are very small blood cells (1.5-3 Î¼m), which play a major role in primary haemostasis and in coagulation mechanisms. Platelet characterization requires their counting (see Chapter 15 ) associated with accurate morphology analysis. We describe the major steps in order to correctly obtain stained blood films, which can be analyzed by optical microscope. Platelet morphology abnormalities are found in acquired malignant hematological diseases such myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. A careful analysis of the platelet size and morphology, by detecting either normal platelets with or without excessive anisocytosis, microplatelets, or large/giant platelets, will contribute to inherited thrombocytopenia diagnosis and gather substantial data when looking for an acquired platelet disorders.
