 PURPOSE: VNP40101M is a novel sulfonylhydrazine alkylating agent with broad antitumor activity in animal models. As alkylating agents are important antileukemia drugs, a Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of VNP40101M was conducted in patients with refractory or relapsed leukemias or poor-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: VNP40101M was given as a single i.v. infusion over 15-70 min on day 1. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks according to antileukemic activity. The starting dose of 220 mg/m(2) was escalated by approximately 33% in cohorts of 3-6 patients until a maximum-tolerated dose was established. One additional cohort was treated with the maximum-tolerated dose divided over days 1 and 8. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients, including 28 with acute myeloid leukemia and 5 with MDS, received 52 courses of treatment. Nondose-limiting, reversible infusion-related toxicities were the most frequent adverse event, occurring in 24 (63%) patients on the first course. Dose escalation was terminated at 708 mg/m(2) for prolonged myelosuppression in 1 of 7 patients, and 600 mg/m(2) was selected as the recommended Phase II dose, with no significant extramedullary toxicity at this dose level. Two patients, 1 with MDS treated with 300 mg/m(2) and 1 with acute myeloid leukemia treated with 600 mg/m(2), achieved complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: VNP40101M had significant antileukemic activity and minimal extramedullary toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.
