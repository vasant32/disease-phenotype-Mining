The occurrence of a thrombocytopathy concomitantly to the development of a malignant haemopathy has been reported for some time, but little is known about the mechanism(s) involved in the platelet dysfunction. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) has now been identified as a principal platelet receptor for collagen. In this paper, we report the cases of two patients with a myelodysplasia and a B lymphopathy, respectively, who presented with thrombocytopathy in relation to a defective GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen. Thus, with regard to the different steps of adhesion, activation secretion or aggregation, patients' platelet responses to collagen and to the GPVI specific agonists, collagen related peptide (CRP) or convulxin were null or dramatically impaired. Platelet responses to other agonists ADP, TRAP, Arachidonic acid were normal or showed only a moderate decrease. GPVI content was repeatedly normal, and binding of specific ligands, such as convulxin, satisfactory. Nevertheless, specific activating monoclonal antibodies and convulxin failed to induce platelet secretion; collagen, CRP or convulxin were unable to provoke calcium mobilisation. Furthermore, using a perfusion chamber model, we showed that ex vivo collagen-induced thrombi formation was very impaired. Taken together, these data provide evidence, for the first time, of an acquired defect in GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen, which reflects data observed in constitutional GPVI deficiencies, in two patients with malignant haemopathies.
