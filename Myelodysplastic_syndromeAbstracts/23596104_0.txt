PURPOSE: this phase II prospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5 days Azacytidine (5d-AZA) in low-risk MDS patients. Secondly, SNP genetic profile and PI-PLCbeta1 levels were studied to evaluate possible biological markers able to predict the hematologic response. Experimental design: the study tested a lower intensity schedule of AZA. The treatment plan consisted on 75 mg/sqm/day subcutaneous administered for 5 days every 28, for a total of 8 cycles. RESULTS: thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study. The overall response rate (ORR) was 47% (15/32) on intention to treat and 58% (15/26) for patients completing the treatment program. In this latter group, 5 (19%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 10 (38%) had hematological improvement (HI), according to the IWG criteria. Three patients have maintained their HI after 37, 34 and 33 months without other treatments. Moreover, 21 and 2 of the 26 cases completing 8 cycles were transfusion dependent for red blood cells and platelets at baseline, respectively. Of these, 7 (33%) and 2 (100%) became transfusion-independent at the end of the treatment program, respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 28% of patients and four patients died early due to infections or hemorrhage. SNP results were not significantly correlated to the clinical outcome, whilst PI-PLCbeta1 level anticipated either positive or negative clinical responses. CONCLUSIONS: 5d-AZA is safe and effective in a proportion of low risk MDS patients. PI-PLCbeta1 gene expression is a reliable and dynamic marker of response that can be useful to optimize AZA therapy.
