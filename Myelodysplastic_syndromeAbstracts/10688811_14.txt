Thirty-five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were registered on protocol MDS 96-02 and were receiving continuous therapy with pentoxifylline 800 mg 3 times a day and ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day by mouth; dexamethasone was added to the regimen for the partial responders and the nonresponders after 12 weeks at a dose of 4 mg by mouth every morning for 4 weeks. Amifostine was administered intravenously 3 times a week at 3 dose levels (200 mg/M(2), 300 mg/M(2), and 400 mg/M(2)) to cohorts of 10 patients each. Therapy has been continued for 1 year in responders. Twenty-nine have completed at least 12 weeks of therapy and are available for response evaluation. Of the 21 men and 8 women (median age, 67 years), 20 had refractory anemia (RA), 3 had RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 5 had RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and 1 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Five had secondary MDS. No differences were noted in response rates among the 3 dose levels. Seven patients did not respond at all, and 22 showed an improvement in cytopenias (76%). Three had a triple lineage response, 10 had a double lineage response, and 9 had a single lineage response (8 of 9 in absolute neutrophil count [ANC] and 1 had more than a 50% reduction in packed red blood cell transfusions). Fifteen patients responded only after the addition of dexamethasone, whereas 7 responded before. When examined by lineage, 19 of 22 showed improved ANC, 11 of 22 demonstrated more than 50% reduction in blood transfusions, improved Hb levels, or both, and 7 of 22 showed improvement in platelet counts. Interestingly, the responses were frequently slow to appear, and continued improvement in counts was seen up to 12 months of therapy and beyond. This study supports the feasibility of treating patients with MDS with the unique approach of cytoprotection and anticytokine therapies as well as the principle that prolonged commitment to treatment is desirable when noncytotoxic agents are administered.
