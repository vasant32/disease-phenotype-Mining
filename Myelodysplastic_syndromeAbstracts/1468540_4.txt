DNA methylation plays an important role in gene regulation. We have analyzed the methylation status of CCGG sites in and around the human proto-oncogene c-myc in blood cells from patients with acute and chronic leukemias and with myelodysplastic syndromes using restriction endonucleases. The 5' region of c-myc was unequivocally hypomethylated in all the 58 specimens studied, including 10 from normal bone marrow and 1 from human placenta. In contrast, the 3' region was hypermethylated in a great majority of cases. However, this region was hypomethylated in 1 of 12 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, 1 of 6 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 4 of 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia preceded by a documented stage of myelodysplastic syndromes. One possible mechanism for the 3' region of c-myc to have remained hypomethylated may be a "delayed methylation" during transforming events toward a more aggressive stage of the disease, but the precise mechanism is unknown.
