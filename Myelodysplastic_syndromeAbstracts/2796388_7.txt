Erythroid and myeloid colonies were grown from the bone marrow of 81 patients with myelodysplasia and the median number of colonies correlated with the FAB classification and Bournemouth score. CFU-GM were increased in CMML compared to RAEB and RAEBt. BFU-E were higher in RA than in the other FAB subgroups. Patients with a high Bournemouth score had poorer CFU-GM and BFU-E growth than those with a low score.
