The pattern of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements was determined in 87 patients with acute and chronic leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes by Southern blot hybridisation. All 31 cases of common, B cell and null cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia showed Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement, and TCR (beta-chain) rearrangement was seen in all 5 cases of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Inappropriate JH and TCR (beta) rearrangements were present in some cases of T-ALL (60%) and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (18%), respectively. For the 19 patients with acute leukaemias following chronic myeloid leukaemia, blastic transformation, all 4 with lymphoid transformation and 3 of the 15 with myeloid transformation had JH rearrangement, and 3 CD10-positive lymphoid transformation and 2 myeloid transformation had their TCR (beta) genes rearranged. In conclusion, the pattern of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements correlated well with the cell lineage. However, cross-lineage rearrangements were more commonly seen in patients with acute leukaemias following chronic myeloid leukaemia blastic transformation, as compared to the de novo cases.
