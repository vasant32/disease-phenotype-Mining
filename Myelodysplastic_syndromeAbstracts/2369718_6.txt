Five female patients, ranging in age between 22 and 36 years, presented with myelodysplastic syndromes during pregnancy between June 1982 and March 1987. Three of these five cases evolved into acute leukemia. A bone marrow transplant was attempted in the fourth. It is suggested that the association of myelodysplastic syndromes during pregnancy is more than coincidental and that acute leukemia evolves in a majority of these cases. Furthermore, refractory macrocytic anemias in pregnancy need to be carefully evaluated for a primary myelodysplastic state.
