Defective hematopoiesis supporting capacity of bone marrow (BM) stroma has been implicated in the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The aim of this study is to explore whether the BM stroma progenitors, namely the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are primarily affected in MDS by evaluating the reserves, the functional properties, as well as the cytogenetic characteristics, in comparison to BM hematopoietic cells, in patients with de novo MDS (n = 13). The number, differentiation potential toward adipocytes/chondrocytes/osteoblasts and immunosuppressive function in terms of inhibition of mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation did not differ significantly between patient and normal (n = 20) MSCs. Patient MSCs did not show any aberrations in the production of proinflammatory or growth-promoting cytokines and did not harbor the cytogenetic abnormalities present in hematopoietic cells. Occasional patient and normal MSC cultures, however, developed irrelevant chromosomal alterations (trisomies 5 and 7) with uncertain pathophysiologic significance. Compared to controls, patient MSCs displayed impaired proliferative and clonogenic potential through passages that might represent a nonspecific abnormality associated with the chronic inflammatory process present in patients' BM. These data suggest that BM MSCs from MDS patients do not belong to the abnormal clone and do not represent the main cellular source contributing to the inflammatory marrow microenvironment.
