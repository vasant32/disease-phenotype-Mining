A patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and pancytopenia is reported. He was red blood cell (RBC)-transfusion dependent. Karyotype analysis showed a complex cytogenetic abnormality consisting of loss of chromosome 7 and trisomy 8. Without cytotoxic treatment, his complete blood count (CBC) subsequently became normal. He is no longer transfusion dependent and repeat cytogenetic analyses are normal.
