An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on trephine biopsies of the bone marrow in 52 patients (28 males/24 females; age 68 years) with various subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to determine the number of macrophages (phagocytic-histiocytic reticular cells). Quantifications included the haemosiderin-storing subpopulation (Prussian-blue reaction) of this lineage as well as the iron-free compartment. The latter was identified by a new monoclonal antibody (PG-M1) which is specifically directed against histiocytic reticular cells. Bone marrow specimens of individuals without haematological disorders and those showing reactive lesions served as controls. In comparison with the normal bone marrow and inflammatory changes (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis) 23 of the 52 patients with MDS revealed a significant increase in macrophages. This increase encompassed not only the iron-laden subpopulation but also the total number of phagocytic reticular cells. Accumulation of macrophages in MDS was speculated to be due to a premature and enforced degradation of dysplastic cell elements leading to phagocytosis of haemosiderin and debris material. Moreover, cells of the monocyte-macrophage system could be involved in the complex pathomechanism of fibrillogenesis, since in a considerable percentage of patients with MDS, an increase in reticulin (argyrophilic) fibres was noticeable. Our finding of an expansion of the macrophage compartment in about half of the patients with MDS is in keeping with results of cell culture studies on colony formation of granulocyte-macrophage precursors (CFU-GM).
