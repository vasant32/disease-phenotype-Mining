Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes. Transplants are clearly indicated in patients with intermediate-2 and high risk disease; there is controversy regarding when transplantation should be performed in patients with low and intermediate-1 risk disease. Most patients with MDS are over age 65 and Medicare has recently provisionally approved transplants, but only when performed as part of a comparative clinical trial which still must be finalized. Nonmyeloablative preparative regimens allow treatment of older patients with MDS, and novel approaches are under evaluation to reduce the risk of relapse and treatment related morbidity and mortality.
