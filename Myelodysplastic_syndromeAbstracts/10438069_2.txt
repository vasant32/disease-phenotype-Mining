Visceral leishmaniasis is a rare but potentially life threatening opportunistic protozoan infection in immunocompromised patients. The clinical manifestations in these patients are unusual and the diagnosis is difficult. They need prolonged treatment and are liable to have relapses. Here we report three patients with haematological malignancy (one with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, one with chronic myeloid leukaemia, and one with myelodysplastic syndrome) complicated with visceral leishmaniasis. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and outcome are discussed.
