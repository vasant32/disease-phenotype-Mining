Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have refractory cytopenias leading to transfusion requirements and infectious complications. In vitro marrow culture data have indicated that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the production of erythroid precursors. In an effort to treat the anemia and neutropenia in this disorder, MDS patients were treated with a combination of recombinant human EPO and recombinant human G-CSF. Fifty-five patients were enrolled in the study of which 53 (96%) had a neutrophil response. Forty-four patients were evaluable for an erythroid response of which 21 (48%) responded. An erythroid response was significantly more likely in those patients with relatively low serum EPO levels, higher absolute basal reticulocyte counts and normal cytogenetics at study entry. Seventeen (81%) of the patients who responded to combined G-CSF plus EPO therapy continued to respond during an 8-week maintenance phase. G-CSF was then discontinued and all patients' neutrophil responses were diminished, whereas 8 continued to have an erythroid response to EPO alone. In 7 of the remaining 9 patients, resumption of G-CSF was required for recurrent erythroid responses. The median duration of erythroid responses to these cytokines was 11 months, with 6 patients having relatively prolonged and durable responses for 15 to 36 months. Our results also indicate that approximately one half of responding patients require both G-CSF and EPO to maintain an effective erythroid response, suggesting that synergy between G-CSF and EPO exists in vivo for the production of red blood cells in MDS.
