 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between evolution of karyotype and clinical progress in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and estimate the clinical outcomes of high risk patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). METHODS: Continuous karyotyping were performed using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and G-banding technique to follow up 41 cases of MDS patients. RESULTS: Karyotype analysis showed that 24 cases (58.5%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities. In a median follow up of 34 months (7 approximately 72 months), 6 cases had karyotype evolution in 12 cases with clinical deterioration, while only one had karyotype evolution in 18 cases without clinical progression. The involved chromosomes included No. 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 and 21. Six out of 7 patients who received allo-HSCT attained complete remission and their abnormal karyotypes returned to normal. Four patients with clinical remission after therapy attained cytogenetic remission too. CONCLUSION: Karyotype evolution showed a strong relationship with clinical progress in MDS patients, and indicated a very poor prognosis. Patients with clinical progress had much higher incidence of clonal evolution than those with relatively stable clinical course. Allo-HSCT should be considered the first choice of therapy for MDS patients with clonal karyotypic abnormalities.
