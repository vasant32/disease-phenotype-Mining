Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical in host defense against malignant transformation and are potent antileukemic cytotoxic effectors. In the present study, we investigated the peripheral NK function in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We demonstrated that the peripheral NK cell population was quantitatively normal in MDS patients. Furthermore, NK cells displayed an expression of the activating natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp46 and NKp30 as well as NKG2D similar to that observed in donors, but exert a highly decreased constitutive cytolytic activity compared to resting normal NK cells. Although activation with IL-2 resulted in the upregulation of NKp46 expression by MDS-NK cells, their cytolytic function remained deeply altered as compared to activated donor NK cells. In addition, MDS NK cells did not proliferate in vitro, and displayed an increased rate of apoptosis in response to IL-2 stimulation although the spontaneous apoptosis was not significantly increased. Interestingly, a proportion of peripheral MDS-NK cells were derived from the MDS clone as the cytogenetic anomaly found in bone marrow karyotype was also detected in 20-50% of circulating NK cells. In conclusion, NK cells' cytolytic function and proliferative capacities in response to activation by cytokines are profoundly altered in MDS.
