In order to study the efficacy of an oral induction and consolidation regimen in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients assessed not to tolerate full-scale intensive chemotherapy, 51 patients over 65 years of age with newly diagnosed AML were randomized to receive two cycles of either totally oral ETI (25 patients) or conventional 5-day TAD (26 patients). The median age of the patients was 73 years, range 65-87 years. Thirty-eight patients had de novo AML and the remaining patients AML subsequent to myelodysplastic syndrome ((n = 11) or treatment related AML (n = 2)). ETI consisted of etoposide 80 mg/m2 and thioguanine 100 mg/m2 twice a day on days 1-5, and idarubicin 15 mg/m2 on days 1-3, all given orally. TAD consisted of oral thioguanine and i.v. cytarabine, both in the dose of 100 mg/m2 twice a day on days 1-5, and daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 on day 5. The maintenance treatment was daily oral mercaptopurine 70 mg/m2 and weekly oral methotrexate 12 mg/m2. In the ETI group complete remission (CR) was achieved in six patients after the first cycle and in nine more patients after the second cycle. The CR rate was 15/25 = 60%. The corresponding figures for the TAD group were four and two remissions, CR rate 6/26 = 23% (p = 0.007). The survival was significantly longer in the ETI arm (p = 0.042). The median survival was 9.9 months in the ETI group and 3.7 months in the TAD group. There were no significant differences in the side effects between the two arms. In conclusion, the totally oral ETI regimen resulted in a significantly higher remission rate and longer survival than the 5-day TAD regimen in elderly patients with AML, with no more toxicity.
