A case of broncholithiasis in a child is reported. To our knowledge, it has not been reported in children. Broncholithiasis is a condition in which a peribronchial calcified lymph node erodes into or distorts an adjacent bronchus. Symptoms of broncholithiasis include cough, recurrent episodes of fever, haemoptysis, and purulent sputum. The most common cause of broncholithiasis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Here we describe a 14-year-old boy known to have disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii (M. kansasii) infection associated with hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He was presented with cough and fever. Computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy revealed a large calcified mass eroding in the right main bronchus. While surgical therapy was considered, haemoptysis developed and his condition deteriorated. Bone marrow puncture revealed acute myeloid leukemic transformation of the MDS. Curation was no longer possible. Post mortem examination revealed a large bronchiolith, evolving from a calcified lymph node.
