Prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes is extremely variable. The prognostic value of the FAB classification has been demonstrated in many studies. However, within the same FAB subtype, some patients may experience prolonged survival, whereas others die in a few weeks. This prognostic heterogeneity makes the therapy decision difficult. In an attempt to identify significant prognostic factors for survival in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), clinical and hematological characteristics were analyzed in 91 patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that bone marrow total blast cells percentages, sex and hemoglobin level were the characteristics significantly associated with survival. A scoring index based upon these three characteristics may be proposed and had a great prognostic value (p < 0.00001). It allows us to separate patients into three groups with low, intermediate and high score with a median survival of 239, 133 and 45 days for each group respectively. This scoring index may be useful in the design of therapy and analysis of future clinical trials. However, its predictive value needs to be confirmed in other series.
