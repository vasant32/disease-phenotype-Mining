 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bu-CY(2) conditioning regimen on allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with unrelated donor for myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: Six patients received chemotherapy regimen of busulfan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (CY) before allogeneic BMT (Bu 4 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1), -7 d - -4 d, CY 60 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1), -3 d - -2 d). Mycophenolate mofetil combined with cyclosporin A and methotrexate was used for prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Lipo prostaglandin E(1)was used in prophylactic regimen for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. RESULT: Neutrophil count began to be higher than 0.5 x 10(9)/Lat the 18th day after BMT. Platelet count began to be higher than 20 x 10(9)/Lat the 21st day after BMT. Disease-free survival in the six patients was 27 months. CONCLUSION: Bu-CY(2) conditioning regimen on allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with unrelated donor is an effective therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
