Aneuploidy, especially monosomy 7 and trisomy 8, is a frequent cytogenetic abnormality in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Patients with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 have distinctly different clinical courses, responses to therapy, and survival probabilities. To determine disease-specific molecular characteristics, we analyzed the gene expression pattern in purified CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from MDS patients with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two methods were employed: standard hybridization and a small-sample RNA amplification protocol for the limited amounts of RNA available from individual cases; results were comparable between these 2 techniques. Microarray data were confirmed by gene amplification and flow cytometry using individual patient samples. Genes related to hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and blood cell function were dysregulated in CD34 cells of both monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 MDS. In trisomy 8, up-regulated genes were primarily involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and down-regulated genes have been implicated in apoptosis inhibition. CD34 cells in monosomy 7 showed up-regulation of genes inducing leukemia transformation and tumorigenesis and apoptosis and down-regulation of genes controlling cell growth and differentiation. These results imply distinct molecular mechanisms for monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 MDS and implicate specific pathogenic pathways.
