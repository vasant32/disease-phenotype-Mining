Recent studies of human samples have shown that the development and progression of malignant hematopoietic diseases are due to the accumulation of gene mutations (1-3). Some associations of mutated genes are frequent, suggesting specific cooperation in the leukemogenic process. ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations are frequently associated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML); this association may define a specific leukemogenic pathway and class of AML (4). RUNX1 but not ASXL1 mutations are found in T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL) (1). RUNX1 mutations are also responsible for familial platelet disorder (FPD) (5), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal platelet function and susceptibility to develop MDS/AML.
