We previously reported a recurrent t(3;8)(q26;q24) translocation involving EVI1 in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Here we report the same structural abnormality in a case of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase. The t(3;8)(q26;q24) occurred several months after the initial diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia, while the patient was being treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We confirmed rearrangement of EVI1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using a dual-color break-apart probe set that spans the EVI1 region. Our findings demonstrate that, similar to other recurrent translocations involving 3q26, such as t(3;3) and t(3;21), the t(3;8)(q26;q24) is implicated not only in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, but also in progression of chronic myeloid leukemia. These findings extend the known disease spectrum associated with this cytogenetic aberration.
