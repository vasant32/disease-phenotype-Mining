 PURPOSE: To describe a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia complicated by orbital cellulitis, panophthalmitis, and ecthyma gangrenosum. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: An immunosuppressed 62-year-old man developed an unusual skin rash and a painful, swollen right eye with decreased vision. He had myelodysplastic syndrome and P. aeruginosa septicemia. The skin rash manifested as ecthyma gangrenosum. Metastatic orbital cellulitis and panophthalmitis was diagnosed. RESULTS: Despite intravitreal and topical gentamicin, the patient eventually required enucleation. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a rare combination of events: an immunocompromised man developed pneumonia, P. aeruginosa septicemia, and endogenous seeding of the Pseudomonas to the skin, orbit, and eye. Early recognition of endogenous ophthalmic disease is imperative. The prognosis of combined orbital cellulitis and panophthalmitis is poor.
