Complex chromosomal aberrations are present in < or =30% of patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a poor prognosis. Specific alterations in complex karyotypes are difficult to define by conventional cytogenetics alone. To obtain a more comprehensive view of the recurrent aberrations, we performed spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with selected probes on bone marrow samples from 17 patients with primary MDS and 3 with primary AML. All cases had chromosome 5 alterations. Two different types of 5q loss were identified: unbalanced translocations and interstitial deletions, or del(5q), each occurring in 10 patients. The most frequent additional chromosome aberrations were -3/-3p/-3q, -7/7q-, +8, 13q-, -16, 17p-, -18/18p-, -20/20q-, and +21q, each occurring in 25%. In the five cases with gain of 21q, involvement of the AML1 gene was excluded. Unbalanced 5q translocations occurred more often in combination with monosomy 3 and 7 and with gain of 21q, whereas del(5q) was associated more often with -1p and trisomy 8. A detailed analysis of specific breakpoints and deletions revealed recurrent involvement of specific chromosomal bands harboring known tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Analysis of large numbers of MDS and AML cases in a similar detailed manner with SKY and FISH will reveal whether new subgroups can be identified according to their genetic alterations. Correlation with clinical parameters may reveal the prognostic significance of these genetic subgroups.
