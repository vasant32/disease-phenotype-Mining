The results of histological and ultrastructural studies of bone marrow hemopoietic microenvironment carried out in 27 patients with different myelodisplasias are presented. The following morphological peculiarities of bone marrow stromal tissue have been identified: abnormal localisation of immature hemopoietic cells, reticuline fibrosis, disorganized erythroid islands, and intranuclear virus-like pathologic inclusions in all stromal cells. The structure of nucleoli in endosteal and perivascular cells was changed. It was shown that morphofunctional changes in hemopoietic environment may lead to hemopoietic disorders.
