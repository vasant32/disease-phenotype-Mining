 UNLABELLED: Background Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication mutation and Raf kinase among others. A phase I dose escalation study of sorafenib was conducted in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty patients received one of two different schedules; Schedule "A": once or twice daily, five days per week, every week for a 21 day cycle, and Schedule "B": once or twice daily, for 14 days every 21 days. Dose limiting toxicities were grade 3/4 hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia, and amylase elevation. The recommended phase II dose in hematologic malignancies is 400 mg twice daily for both schedules. RESULTS: Complete remissions or complete remissions with incomplete recovery of platelets were achieved in 5 (10%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Significant reduction in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood blasts was seen in an additional 17 (34%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Eleven of these responses (including 3 complete remissions/complete remissions with incomplete recovery) lasted for 2 cycles or beyond. In conclusion, sorafenib is active and well tolerated in acute myelogenous leukemia with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutation. Conclusions Additional studies of sorafenib in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, particularly those with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication, are warranted, including sorafenib-based combinations.
