Subcutaneous administration of recombinant human Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in a dose of 1-3 x 10(4) U/day for 14 to 72 days resulted in an increase in circulating granulocytes and bone marrow monocytes in all the 4 patients examined. Circulating platelet count was also increased in two of four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and aplastic anemia (AA). Bone marrow examination revealed an increase in megakaryocyte count in these patients, whereas the percentage of blast was not changed. An increase in blood platelet count was accompanied by an increase in serum GM-CSF in a patient with AA, whereas serum IL-6 level was not changed throughout the treatment with IL-1 beta. These findings suggest that IL-1 beta may be useful for the treatment of a proportion of patients with MDS and AA who are associated with thrombocytopenia.
