Abnormalities of the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p) are found in about 5% of acute nonlymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). They are described to be characteristic of secondary leukaemias, especially after prior mutagenic exposure, and to be associated with a poor prognosis. In our series of 59 patients with 12p abnormalities and ANLL or MDS, exposure to genotoxic agents was proven only in five patients, but in 13/44 patients ANLL evolved from an MDS. Patients with a small deletion del(12)(p11.2p13) having a mild clinical course were distinguished from those with a large del(12)(p11.2), additional chromosomal anomalies, and a poor clinical course. Among the 31 patients with translocations or dicentric chromosomes involving 12p, a group of eight with t/dic(12;13) was the most frequent and was associated with a poor prognosis. The clinical outcome was adverse in the majority of patients with complex karyotype abnormalities, but in some patients a milder clinical course seems likely. A new, hitherto undescribed, abnormality in an MDS case with a duplication dup(12)(p11.2p13) was the amplification of the signal of the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone 964c10 (D12S736). In 38 cases with deletions or unbalanced translocations/dicentrics one YAC signal was lost. Five patients with balanced translocations demonstrated breakpoints within the YAC, containing the ETV6 (TEL) gene. The breakpoints were telomeric to the YAC 964c10 in seven cases and centromeric in one patient.
