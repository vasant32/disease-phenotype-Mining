The core-binding factor (CBF) complex is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of 2 subunits, CBFalpha and CBFbeta, that play a major role in hematopoiesis. Both members of the CBF complex are frequently altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by translocation, most commonly t(8;21), t(12;21), and t(3;21) for CBFalpha, located in 21q22, and inv(16)(p13;q22) for CBFbeta, located on 16q22. Recently, a new mechanism of alteration of CBFalpha, by point mutation, has been reported in myeloid malignancies, particularly in M0 AML. In the present study, we found no point mutation of the CBFbeta gene in 30 myelodysplastic syndromes and 100 AMLs, suggesting a limited role, if any, of CBFbeta point mutations in those disorders.
