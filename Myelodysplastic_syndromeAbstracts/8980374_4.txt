We report two cases of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in two patients 6 and 18 years of age, respectively (cases 1 and 2) who had no clinical evidence of immunodeficiency or risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Histologic analysis in both cases revealed diffuse nodal effacement by a monotonous population of atypical lymphoid cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei, with very infrequent mitotic activity. The neoplastic cells in both cases were of B-cell lineage (CD20 and CD79a positive), with CD43 coexpression. One case showed monoclonal light chain expression, and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in both cases. Abnormal cytogenetic findings were detected in case 2, in which metaphase spreads revealed trisomy 13 (karyotype 47, XY, +13). Although trisomy 13 has been described in association with acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, this case represents the first documented association of trisomy 13 with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Interphase cytogenetics analysis for trisomy 3, reported to be associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, was negative in both cases. Although low-grade lymphomas of the MALT type have been reported in HIV-positive patients, the two cases reported here are unique in that they occurred in young patients without HIV infection or any other evidence of immunodeficiency.
