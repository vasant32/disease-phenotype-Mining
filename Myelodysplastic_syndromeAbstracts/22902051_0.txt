Various gene mutations have been reported in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Serial studies of mutations during follow-up are important for investigating the stability of the mutations for use as minimal residual disease (MRD) markers. Sequential quantitative analyses of 5 patients with spliceosome-related gene mutations by allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the U2AF1 S34F and SF3B1 K666N were persistently retained during the disease progression. The spliceosome-related gene mutations appear to be stable during disease progression and may be useful as potential markers for MRD monitoring in MDS patients that usually lack established specific MRD markers.
