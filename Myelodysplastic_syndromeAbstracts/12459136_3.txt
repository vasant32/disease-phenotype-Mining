 OBJECTIVE: To analyze comparability between the ninth and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) applied to coding causes of death in Spain. METHODS: According to the ninth and tenth revisions of the ICD, 80,084 statistical bulletins of mortality registered in 1999 were assigned the Basic Cause of Death. The statistical bulletins corresponded to the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Cantabria, Murcia, Navarre and the Basque Country, and the city of Barcelona. The underlying causes of death were classified into 17 groups. Simple correspondence, the Kappa index and the comparability ratio for major causes were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 3.6% of deaths changed group due to an increase (36.4%) in infectious and parasitic diseases, mainly because of the inclusion of AIDS, and a corresponding decrease due to the exclusion of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, myelodysplastic syndrome was moved to the category of neoplasm. The group including nervous system diseases, eye and related diseases, and ear and mastoid apophysis diseases increased (14.7%) at the expense of mental and behavior disorders, due to the inclusion of senile and presenile organic psychosis. Poorly-defined entities increased (14.1%) due to the inclusion of cardiac arrest and its synonyms, together with heart failure, to the detriment of diseases of the vascular system. Diseases of the respiratory system increased (4.8%) due to the inclusion of respiratory failure, previously considered as a poorly defined cause. The correspondence for all causes was 96.4% and kappa's index was 94.9% CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of ICD-10 affects the comparability of statistical series of mortality according to cause. The results of this study allow us to identify the main modifications and to quantify the changes in the major causes of mortality in Spain.
