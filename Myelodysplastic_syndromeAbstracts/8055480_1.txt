Clonal chromosomal abnormalities occur in about one-third of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) and are usually those found in other myelodysplastic syndromes. Abnormalities of chromosome 3, which have been associated with abnormal thrombopoiesis, are relatively uncommon. A patient with CMMoL with inv(3)(q21q26) and normal thrombopoiesis is presented, and the cytogenetics of CMMoL are reviewed. The possible significance of chromosome 3 in thrombopoiesis is discussed.
