During 1990 to 1993, five patients who had been treated in our hospital for aplastic anemia (AA) with a normal karyotype, were found to have hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes (hMDS); three patients with RA, one RAEB, and one RAEB-T, and all of them have chromosomal abnormalities. The mean age of the hMDS patients (4 men, 1 woman) was 51.0 years (range 31-61). We retrospectively studied the hematological features of the 5 cases in the early stage without chromosomal abnormalities. They showed, 1) appearance of erythroblasts (3/5), 2) more reticulocyte counts than typical AA (mean 7.8 x 10(4)/microliter), 3) macrocytic anemia (mean MCV 106fl) in peripheral blood, 4) relative erythroid hyperplasia (M/E ratio 0.2-1.5), and 5) low lymphocyte counts (mean percentage of lymphocytes 32, 8%) in bone marrow. Considering about the differences or transformation between AA and hMDS, it is interesting that all five patients have initially had a normal karyotype and subsequently developed chromosomal abnormalities.
