We analyzed the disease-specific outcomes of adult patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated with cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning. Between August 1998 and June 2009, 33 adult patients with advanced MDS were treated with unrelated CBT. The diagnoses at transplantation included refractory anemia with excess blasts (n=7) and MDS-related secondary AML (sAML) (n=26). All patients received four fractionated 12 Gy TBI and chemotherapy as myeloablative conditioning. The median age was 42 years, the median weight was 55 kg and the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.51 × 10(7) cells per kg. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 50 was 91%. Neutrophil recovery was significantly faster in sAML patients (P=0.04). The cumulative incidence of plt recovery at day 200 was 88%. Plt recovery was significantly faster in CMV seronegative patients (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and extensive-type chronic GVHD was 67 and 34%, respectively. Degree of HLA mismatch had a significant impact on the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD (P=0.021). TRM and relapse at 5-years was 14 and 16%, respectively. The probability of EFS at 5 years was 70%. No factor was associated with TRM, relapse and EFS. These results suggest that adult advanced MDS patients without suitable related or unrelated BM donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.
