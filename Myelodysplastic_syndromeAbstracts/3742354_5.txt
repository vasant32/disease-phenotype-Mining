Clinical and pathological findings in three cats affected with a myelodysplastic disorder are presented. This hematological disorder resembles that of refractory anemia with excess of blasts as seen in man. The hematological profile in man is one of peripheral cytopenia in one or all of the marrow cell lines which occurs despite a normal to hypercellular bone marrow. Quantitatively, the marrow has a preponderance of blasts (up to 20%). Qualitative abnormalities consist of dysthrombopoiesis and/or dyserythropoiesis and/or dysgranulopoiesis. Myelodysplastic disorders in the cat are a form of marrow failure often associated with infection with feline leukemia virus. The use of the term refractory anemia with excess of blasts appears to be applicable to the cat and should be considered in evaluating dysplastic disorders of the feline bone marrow.
