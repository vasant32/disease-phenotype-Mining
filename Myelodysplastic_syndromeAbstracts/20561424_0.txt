This study was aimed to investigate the expression of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS and DLK1 mRNA in the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its clinical significance. The mRNA expression of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS and DLK1 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 16 patients with MDS and 3 controls were detected by RT-PCR. The results indicated that the expression of DLK1 mRNA was up-regulated in MDS, including RA and RAEB, as compared with controls (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of DLK1 between RA and RAEB patients (p > 0.05); the expression of c-FLIPL mRNA both in RA and RAEB patients was higher than that in controls (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of c-FLIPL between RA and RAEB patients (p > 0.05); the expression of c-FLIPS mRNA was not significantly different between MDS patients and controls (p > 0.05), but its expression in RAEB patients was significantly higher as compared with RA patients and controls (p < 0.05). It is concluded that the mRNA expressions of DLK1, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS in MDS patients are abnormal, some of which may be useful as an important indicator for the evaluation of development in MDS.
