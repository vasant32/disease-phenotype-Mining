A pilot study of anticytocine therapy (PCD) was carried out in 9 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). After 12 weeks, 2 patients (22%) showed hematological response cutting down the need for washed-out erythrocyte transfusions by half or more. MDS progression at different stages was reported in 4; transformation to acute myeloleukemia--2. PCD treatment is indicated in MDS patients, aged over 65, with a less than 10% blast level of the bone marrow, and without any risks of tumor progression.
