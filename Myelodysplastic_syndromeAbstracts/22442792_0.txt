We studied the expression of VCAM-1 adhesion molecules on stromal cells from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, healthy donors, and patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases and acute leukemias. Expression of adhesion molecule on mesenchymal stromal cells from the bone marrow of patients and healthy donors was evaluated after 2-4 passages by the methods of immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis. VCAM-1 expression in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes was lower than in healthy donors. At the same time, VCAM-1 expression was not identified on mesenchymal cells from acute leukemia patients. VCAM-1 expression on cells from patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases did not differ from that in healthy donors. We conclude that VCAM-1 synthesis in bone marrow stromal cells is impaired in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemias. These changes can be followed by the loss of relationships between hemopoietic cells and stromal microenvironment in bone marrow niches. Hemopoietic cells gain the ability for uncontrolled growth, which results in progression of the disease.
