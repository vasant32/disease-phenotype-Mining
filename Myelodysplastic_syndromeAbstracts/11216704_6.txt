 BACKGROUND: Immunodeficiency in pediatric patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has not been described. We report the clinical course of three children with MDS, hypogammaglobulinemia, and reduced numbers of B-cells and B-cell precursors. OBSERVATIONS: Three patients with recurrent infection who were younger than 1-year-old had MDS of the refractory anemia (RA) subtype diagnosed. All had reduced numbers of circulating B-cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. In two patients, cytogenetic studies revealed a monosomy 7 karyotype and bone marrow studies showed decreased numbers of CD34+ progenitor cells and CD 19+ B-cells. Both patients had prolonged courses (7 yrs 10 mos and 6 yrs 9 mos) characterized by recurrent infection and slowly progressive pancytopenia. Both received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The third patient had normal cytogenetic studies and a normal number of CD34+ progenitors but decreased CD19+ B-cells in the bone marrow. She had a stable course with refractory anemia over the course of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with MDS may have hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced numbers of B-cells. These findings do not preclude a relatively stable and prolonged clinical course. Children with newly diagnosed MDS should have an immunologic evaluation in addition to their hematologic assessment.
