We performed a retrospective analysis of 143 consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndrome to study the possible relationship between patient age and cytogenetic findings in this disorder. There were 96 men and 47 women, with a mean age of 63 years. Eighty-six patients were 63 years old and above, and 57 patients were younger than 63 years of age. The distributions of the five FAB subtypes were comparable in both groups of patients, except for a higher percentage of refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts in older patients. The incidences of cytogenetic abnormalities were similar in the two groups. However, the younger patients tended to have a higher frequency of involvement of chromosomes 5 or 7 than the elderly patients (p < 0.05). The implications of our findings in relation to the biology of myelodysplastic syndrome are discussed.
