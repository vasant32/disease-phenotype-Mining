We report the development of acute, tender, erythematous plaques in a 65 year old female with Myelodysplastic Syndrome transforming to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. The clinical presentation strongly suggested Sweet's syndrome. Histopathological examination of the plaques showed a normal epidermis, dermal and subcutaneous oedema, and large numbers of polymorphs in the panniculus. The eruption responded quickly to systemic steroids, with recrudescence when steroid dosage was reduced. She remained symptom free when prednisolone dosage was reduced more slowly.
