The synthetic oligonucleotide probes were used for the analysis of N-ras oncogenes detected in human acute leukemias. The mutations of N-ras genes were observed to occur randomly among the subtypes of myeloid leukemias, whereas the N-ras mutations at codon 12 are more likely to occur in lymphoid leukemias than other mutations. The mutations at codon 13 of the N-ras gene were not detected in acute leukemias although they were found in myelodysplastic syndrome that is considered to be a preleukemic state.
