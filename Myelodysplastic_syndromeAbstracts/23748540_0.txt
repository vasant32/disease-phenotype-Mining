The role of iron toxicity is well known in gastroenterology and hematology: hemochromatosis, thalassemia major and myelodysplastic syndromes represent iron toxicity models with evidence of serious damages to target organs such as the heart, the liver and endocrine tissues. Iron chelation therapy has dramatically changed the survival rate of thalassemia major since the introduction of desferoxamine with quantitative assessment of tissue iron overload by magnetic resonance imaging. Reperfusion hemorrhage is an independent predictor of left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. Hemorrhage may be a source of iron toxicity and a mediator of inflammation, directly contributing to left ventricular remodeling. Iron chelation may potentially alleviate these cardiotoxic effects. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can provide insights into miocrovascular obstruction, hemorrhage and iron chelation.
