In order to detect possible relationships between cytogenetic abnormalities and morphologic features in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 48 patients with MDS were investigated. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in bone marrow cells from 27 patients (56%). The most frequent single anomaly was del (5 q) (10 cases), followed by monosomy 7 (3 cases), trisomy 8 (3 cases) and del (20 q) (2 cases). Complex anomalies were present in 6 patients. Morphologically, according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification: 17 cases were considered as refractory anemia (RA), 17 as RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), 2 as RAEB in transformation, 2 as acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anemia and 10 as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. With regard to the FAB classification, del (5 q) was often associated with RA and complex cytogenetic anomalies with RAEB. When myelodysplasia was studied in individual myeloid lineages, del (5 q) was associated with hypolobulated megakaryocytes, monosomy 7 with micromegakaryocytes and complex chromosomal anomalies with the association of two or more features of dysmegakaryocytopoiesis. Del (11 q) was associated with increased iron storage and del (20 q) with marked dyserythropoiesis. No correlation was observed between cytogenetic anomalies and features of dysgranulocytopoiesis.
