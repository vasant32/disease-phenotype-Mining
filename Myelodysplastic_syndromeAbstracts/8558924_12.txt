As a first step to evaluate the possibility of gene therapy using adenoviral vectors in hematological malignancies in vivo, we tested the efficacy of gene transfer by a recombinant adenovirus in cell lines and fresh cells from various hematological neoplasms. Thirteen cell lines and samples from 27 patients were studied. Cells were infected by a recombinant adenovirus expressing beta galactosidase gene (Ad RSV betagal) and efficacy of transduction assessed by evaluating betagal expression in cells with a histochemical method. After infection of the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 p.f.u./cell, the percentage of beta gal-positive cells after 48h was high in two cell lines. K562 (64%) and RPMI 8226 (a myeloma cell line, 65%), relatively large in the two myeloma cell lines tested (41% and 20%, respectively) and in MT4 (an adult T cell leukemia cell line, 38%) and low or absent in other cell lines. In fresh samples from AML, ALL, CLL, NHL, myeloma and MDS, no betagal positive cells were seen 48h and 72h after infection, except in one case of myeloma and one case of CLL (where 10% and 2% of betagal positive cells were seen after infection, respectively). Exposure of fresh malignant cells to GM-CSF before and during adenoviral infection, in three cases, did not increase the number of transfected cells. This suggests that adenoviral vectors, at least in their present form, cannot efficiently be used for direct gene transfer in hematological malignant cells.
