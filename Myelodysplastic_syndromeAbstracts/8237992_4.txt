The purpose of this study was to improve erythropoiesis in patients with anemia due to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We treated 13 patients first with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) for 6 weeks, then with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) and rhGM-CSF for the next 12 weeks. Five patients had refractory anemia (RA), 3 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RAS), and 5 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Ten patients were transfusion-dependent at the time of inclusion. Eleven patients completed this phase II study. Five responded with an increase in hemoglobin level (3 patients) or a reduction in transfusion requirement (2 patients). We registered no response in the remaining 6 patients during treatment. Patients responding to combined treatment had relatively low concentrations of plasma Epo and plasma ferritin before treatment with rhEpo and a normal karyotype throughout the study. Long-term bone marrow cultures did not predict the response. Still, responders seemed to have a higher number of colony-forming progenitors than nonresponders. In conclusion, combined therapy with rhGM-CSF and rhEpo may stimulate hematopoiesis and correct or improve anemia in some patients with MDS.
