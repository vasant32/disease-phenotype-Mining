We have reported the case of a 57-year-old man with a myelodysplastic syndrome who had sudden paraplegia and paresthesias of both legs. Myelogram was normal, but an aortogram showed thrombosis of the abdominal aorta. Thrombectomy disclosed a clot composed of nonseptate hyphae with right angle branching, characteristic of the family Mucoraceae. Though angioinvasion and septic thrombosis are characteristic features of mucormycosis, aortic thrombosis has not previously been reported with this infection.
