A case of lipoid pneumonia with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is reported. A 61-year-old man was autopsied after suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) for 13 years. Interstitial lesions of the lungs were suspected as infiltration of leukemia cells before the autopsy. However, blastic leukemia cells were not observed in the lung, although they were seen in the bone marrow and spleen at autopsy. Instead, an unusual amount of cholesterol deposits was observed with mucormycosis and aspergillosis in the lungs. Cholesterol deposition was observed not only in perihilar but also in subpleural regions without apparent bronchial obstruction in both lungs. It is thought that malfunction of monocytes/macrophages resulted in repeated fungal infection and storage of cholesterol caused by tissue destruction and impaired tissue repairing.
