 OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of brucellosis with myelo-dysplastic syndrome (MDS). CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 70-year-old woman presented with pancytopenia and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The initial diagnosis was brucellosis; the woman was treated with doxycycline and rifampin against Brucella melitensis but was later diagnosed as suffering from MDS. She was immediately transferred to the Department of Hematology for further evaluation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the rarity of brucellosis with MDS, and we recommend that brucellosis with MDS be considered in patients presenting with pancytopenia and FUO.
