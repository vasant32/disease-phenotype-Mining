This report describes a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) in whom a complete remission was achieved and sustained 15 months after treatment with 25-OH vitamin D3. No side-effects were observed. Although vitamin D1 has been used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, to our knowledge this is the first case of long-standing remission in a patient with CMML. This 'differentiation therapy' might be considered as a possible alternative in the management of this disease.
