Two new HLA-C alleles have been identified by reverse line blot assay and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. The first polymorphism encodes an amino acid change from lysine in Cw*12022 to asparagine in Cw*1208 at residue 66. The second polymorphism encodes two amino acid changes from isoleucine in Cw*03031 to threonine in Cw*0313 at residue 93 and isoleucine to leucine at residue 94. The functional significance of these polymorphisms on peptide-binding and/or T-cell recognition is unknown.
