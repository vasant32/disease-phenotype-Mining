BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the rearrangement of MLL gene in bone marrow cells of patients with hematological malignancies with various types of 11q aberrations. These aberrations have been observed in acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias as well as in myelodysplasias and lymphomas. METHODS AND RESULTS: Correlations of clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients were evaluated. Using classical cytogenetic techniques we found 11q aberration in 17 patients with different hematological malignancies. FISH with dual color locus specific probe for MLL gene was used to confirm or exclude the rearrangement of this gene. Whole chromosome painting probes and multicolor FISH were performed for identification of chromosomes involved in complex translocations. Balanced rearrangements of 11q were found in 3 patients, in 14 patients unbalanced aberrations were found with rearrangement (4), deletion (4) and amplification (2) of MLL gene. In 7 patients no rearrangement of MLL gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients was not significant, therefore further studies of larger cohort of patients are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of 11q rearrangement.
