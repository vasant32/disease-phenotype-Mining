 BACKGROUND: Ezatiostat is a glutathione analog prodrug glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) inhibitor. This study evaluated 2 extended dose schedules of oral ezatiostat in 89 heavily pretreated patients with low to intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Patients were randomized by 1 stratification factor-baseline cytopenia (anemia only vs anemia with additional cytopenias)-to 1 of 2 extended dosing schedules. Multilineage hematologic improvement (HI) responses were assessed by International Working Group 2006 criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 11 of 38 (29%) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients had HI-Erythroid (HI-E) response. The median duration of HI-E response was 34 weeks. Multilineage responses were observed. There was 1 cytogenetic complete response in a del (5q) MDS patient. An important trend was the effect of prior therapy on response. A 40% HI-E rate (6 of 15 patients) was observed in patients who had prior lenalidomide and no prior hypomethylating agents (HMAs), with 5 of 11 (45%) patients achieving significant RBC transfusion reduction and 3 of 11 (27%) achieving transfusion independence. A 28% HI-E rate (5 of 18 patients) was observed in patients who were both lenalidomide and HMA naive, with 4 of 8 (50%) patients achieving clinically significant RBC transfusion reductions. Most common ezatiostat-related adverse events were grade 1 and 2 gastrointestinal including: nausea (45%, 17%), diarrhea (26%, 7%), and vomiting (30%, 12%). CONCLUSIONS: Ezatiostat is the first GSTP1-1 inhibitor shown to cause clinically significant and sustained reduction in RBC transfusions, transfusion independence, and multilineage responses in MDS patients. The tolerability and activity profile of ezatiostat may offer a new treatment option for patients with MDS.
