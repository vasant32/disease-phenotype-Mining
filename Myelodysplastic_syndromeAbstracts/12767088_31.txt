 BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-abl, bcr/abl, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R). c-kit is expressed in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). METHODS: The authors investigated the efficacy of imatinib in patients with these disorders. Forty-eight patients with AML (n = 10), MDS (n = 8), myelofibrosis (n = 18), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 7), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n = 3), or polycythemia vera (n = 2) were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily. RESULTS: None of the patients with AML or MDS responded. Among patients with myelofibrosis, 10 of 14 patients with splenomegaly (71%) had a 30% or greater reduction in spleen size, 1 patient had trilineage hematologic improvement, 2 had erythroid hematologic improvement, and 1 had improvement in platelet count. One patient with atypical CML had erythroid hematologic improvement. Both patients with polycythemia vera needed fewer phlebotomies (from 2-3 per year to none during the 8 months of therapy and from 3-6 per year to 1 during 9 months of therapy). None of the three patients with CMML responded. Treatment was well tolerated. The side effects were similar to those observed in patients with CML. CONCLUSIONS: Within these small subgroups of disease types, single-agent imatinib did not achieve a significant clinical response among patients with AML, MDS, atypical CML, or CMML without PDGF-R fusion genes. Preliminary data on polycythemia vera are promising and deserve further investigation. Responses among myelofibrosis patients were minor. Therefore, a combination treatment regimen including imatinib may be more effective.
