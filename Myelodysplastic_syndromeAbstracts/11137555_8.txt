The outcome of continued EPO therapy was studied in 18 responding MDS patients. The EPO dose was reduced in a stepwise fashion to find the lowest possible maintenance dose. Relapses of anemia were associated with either progressive disease or reduction of the administered EPO dose. In the latter group second responses to renewed EPO therapy were readily achieved. Long-term responses were seen in about a third of the patients. Thus, it seems safe to reduce the EPO dose among responding patients. This approach may have advantages both from a medical and a socio-economic perspective.
