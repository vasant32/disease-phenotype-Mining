X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XCIP) analysis has been widely used to assess cell clonality in various types of neoplasms in humans. In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction-based feline XCIP analysis using the feline androgen receptor gene was developed. To construct the system of the analysis, polymorphism in CAG tandem repeats within the feline androgen receptor gene was explored using somatic DNAs from 50 male and 103 female cats. CAG tandem repeats in exon 1 of the feline androgen receptor gene were found to be polymorphic, containing 15 to 22 CAG repeats. Of the 103 female cats, 70 (68%) were heterozygous for the number of CAG repeats, indicating the possible usefulness of XCIP analysis in cats. Application of the feline XCIP analysis to 3 feline mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell lines revealed distinctly skewed XCIPs in these cell lines, indicating their clonal origins. Twelve (80%) of the 15 primary tissue/cell samples obtained from cats with various neoplastic diseases showed skewed XCIPs. Moreover, bone marrow samples from 3 cats with myelodysplastic syndrome were also found to have skewed XCIPs. The polymerase chain reaction-based XCIP analysis developed in this study can provide information on cell clonality in female cats, potentially facilitating the differential diagnosis of various disorders in cats.
