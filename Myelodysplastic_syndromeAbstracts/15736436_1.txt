Accurate detection of the abnormal clone in children with persistent cytopenia (PC) may confirm the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and determine prognosis and evolution of the disease. Bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained from 65 children, 11 of which were finally diagnosed as primary or secondary MDS. Ten to 20 G-banded metaphases were analyzed and FISH was performed using a-satellite probes for chromosomes 7 and 8. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) was successful in 40/65 samples, revealing clonal aberrations in 3 patients with MDS. FISH was successful in all cases, detecting monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 abnormal clones in 5 patients. Abnormalities were identified in 3/6 children with primary MDS and 3/5 with secondary MDS. None of the patients with PC of etiology other than MDS had a clonal abnormality in the BM. The results confirm the high incidence of chromosome abnormalities in childhood MDS and the sensitivity of FISH in detecting minor abnormal clones.
