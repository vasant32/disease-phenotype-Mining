The activity of alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase was measured in polymorphonuclears in 20 cases of myelodysplasia syndromes, 10 cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Reduced phosphatase activity was found in 5 cases and peroxidase activity in 3 cases of myelodysplasia syndromes. No evident correlation was noted between the activity of these enzymes and prognosis. Increased proportion of peroxidase-negative granulocytes was observed, moreover, in most cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The observations will be continued in larger material.
