In recent pediatric trials of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), children with Down syndrome (DS) have had significantly more megakaryoblastic leukemia and have experienced better outcome than other children. To further characterize AML in DS, Children's Cancer Group Studies 2861 and 2891 prospectively studied demography, biology, and response in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of children with and without DS. These studies evaluated timing of induction therapy and compared postremission chemotherapy with marrow transplantation in 1,206 children. One-hundred eighteen (9.8%) had DS, a fourfold increase in 20 years. DS patients were younger, had lower white blood cell and platelet counts, more antecedent MDS, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia or undifferentiated AML, and an under-representation of chromosomal translocations (P < .001 for each variable). Four-year event-free survival in DS was 69% versus 35% in others (P < .001). Intensively timed induction conferred significantly higher mortality in DS patients; bone marrow transplantation offered no advantage. Conventional induction followed by chemotherapy achieved an 88%, 4-year, disease-free survival in DS patients versus 42% in others (P < .001). Megakaryoblastic leukemia was unfavorable in others but prognostically neutral in DS. AML in DS is demographically and biologically distinct from AML in other children. It is singularly responsive to conventional chemotherapy and may warrant even less therapy. The increasing proportion of DS patients with AML most likely reflects changes in attitudes about entering DS patients on AML trials and possibly increasing ability to distinguish megakaryoblastic leukemia from lymphoid leukemia.
