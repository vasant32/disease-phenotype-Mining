PURPOSE: To investigate whether the abnormalities observed on femoral marrow magnetic resonance images are related to the development of leukemia and survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The findings on magnetic resonance images of the femoral marrow were evaluated over periods of 1 to 92 months (median, 18 months) in 42 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed MDS. Magnetic resonance images were obtained by the T1-weighted spin echo method and the short T1 inversion recovery technique. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images showed that the femoral marrow patterns changed from fatty, faint, or nodular to scattered or uniform as the disease progressed. Development of acute myeloid leukemia was observed in only 13 patients whose marrow exhibited a scattered or uniform pattern. The overall survival of the 29 patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern was significantly shorter than that of the 13 patients with a fatty, faint, or nodular marrow pattern (10.7% v 73.3% at 7 years; P < .01). The period of leukemia-free survival was also significantly shorter in the patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern versus a fatty, faint, or nodular pattern (37.7% v 100% at 7 years; P < .01). CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance images of the femoral marrow can provide valuable information for assessing the prognosis and determining the most appropriate management of patients with MDS.
