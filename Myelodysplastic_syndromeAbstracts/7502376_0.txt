By staining human bone marrow cells with a monoclonal antibody reacting with surface antigens on erythroid precursor cells (AS-E1) and with propidium iodide reacting with nuclear DNA, we have evaluated the proliferative activity of erythropoiesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes using flow cytometric analysis. Comparing 36 patients (13 RA/RAS, 13 RAEB, 10 RAEB-t) with seven normal controls, significant differences in both the percentage of erythroid precursor cells and the fraction of these cells in the S or S-G2M-phase of the DNA cell cycle between the four groups were found. Since neither the percentage of erythroid precursor cells nor their fraction in S or S-G2M phase alone was found to characterize their proliferative activity, we calculated the proliferative fractions of the erythroid cells, i.e. the number of the erythroid precursor cells in S or S-G2M related to all bone marrow cells in S or S-G2M phase. Applying these parameters, we found significantly increased proliferative fractions of erythroid precursor cells in the RA/RAS patients compared to the normal controls (p-0.03 and 0.002 respectively), as well as a highly significant decrease with disease progression.
