A 42-year-old male patient with a history of occupational exposure to benzene presented with pancytopenia. His bone marrow showed evidence of trilineage dysplasia and cytogenetic analysis revealed a unique t(9;13)(q34;q12) translocation. Five months after diagnosis he developed secondary AML. He was treated with four courses of chemotherapy and an autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Four years post-transplantation he remains in haematological and morphological remission though the cytogenetic abnormality is still present in all metaphases examined.
