Mononuclear cells of the bone marrow (BM) of patients in various subgroups of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were studied by flow cytometry for the expression of myeloid and lymphoid markers both on the surface and in the cytoplasm. A significantly higher percentage of the BM cells of MDS patients reacted with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to myeloid antigens (CD13, CD15 and CD33) by cytoplasmic staining as compared with cell surface staining. The percentage of BM cells expressing CD34 was markedly elevated in patients with RAEB-T. A distinct finding in MDS patients was the expression of myeloid antigens on mononuclear BM cells. The proportion of individuals whose mononuclear BM cells were positive for surface reactivity with anti-CD13 and anti-CD33 mAbs was highest among RAEB-T patients while none of the patients with RA expressed these surface antigens. Cytoplasmic staining significantly increased the percentage of CD13+ and CD33+ BM cells among RAEB and RAEB-T patients. The proportion of individuals whose BM cells possessed myeloid antigens was increased by cytoplasmic staining in all subgroups of MDS. The BM of a considerable proportion of RAEB-T and RAEB patients showed cells which coexpressed the CD7 and CD3 lymphoid markers along with the CD13 and CD33 myeloid antigens. The present study indicates the importance of comparative surface and cytoplasmic immunophenotyping with CD13 and CD33 mAbs for the diagnosis of subgroups of MDS. The coexpression of CD3 and CD7 with markers of the myeloid lineage may reflect derangement of the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells characteristic for MDS.
