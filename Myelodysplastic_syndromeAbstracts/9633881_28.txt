To evaluate the diagnostic value of thrombopoietin (TPO, c-mpl ligand) measurements, and clarify the regulatory mechanisms of TPO in normal and in thrombocytopenic conditions, the plasma TPO concentration was determined in normal individuals (n = 20), umbilical cord blood (n = 40), chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; n = 16), in severe aplastic anaemia (SAA; n = 3), chemotherapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia (n = 10), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 11), and sequentially during peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (n = 7). A commercially available ELISA and EDTA-plasma samples were used for the analysis. The plasma TPO concentration in the normals and umbilical cord blood were 52 +/- 12 pg/ml and 66 +/- 12 pg/ml, respectively. The corresponding values in patients with SAA and chemotherapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia were 1514 +/- 336 pg/ml and 1950 +/- 1684 pg/ml, respectively, and the TPO concentration, measured sequentially after myeloablative chemotherapy and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation, was inversely related to the platelet count. In contrast, the plasma TPO recorded in patients with ITP (64 +/- 20 pg/ml) and MDS (68 +/- 23 pg/ml) were only slightly higher than normal levels. In conclusion, TPO levels were significantly elevated in patients in which bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelets in circulation were markedly reduced, whereas TPO levels were normal in ITP patients, and only slightly increased in the MDS patients. These latter patients displayed a preserved number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow biopsies. Our data support the suggestion that megakaryocyte mass affects the plasma TPO concentration. In thrombocytopenic patients a substantially increased plasma TPO implies deficient megakaryocyte numbers. However, TPO measurements do not distinguish between ITP and thrombocytopenia due to dysmegakaryopoiesis, as seen in MDS patients.
