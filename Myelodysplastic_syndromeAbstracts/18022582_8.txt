Haploidentical transplantation is a feasible alternative for patients with life-threatening hematologic diseases who lack a matched donor. Factors affecting the clinical outcomes of haploidentical transplantation remain under investigation. We analyzed 157 consecutive patients with leukemia who underwent transplantation with nonmanipulated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized marrow and peripheral blood cells (G-BMPBs) from haploidentical donors after receiving myeloablative chemotherapy (Ara-C + BuCy + antithymocyte globulin). Follow up observations after transplantation were made from 48 days to 1191 days (median, 448 days). Multivariate analysis indicated that the cohort given higher doses of CD3(+) cells (> or = 177 x 10(6) /kg) in allograft transplantation had a significantly lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) (relative risk [RR] = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.16-0.77; P = .0090), better leukemia-free survival (LFS) (RR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.26-0.84; P = .0106), and better overall survival (OS) (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.78; P = .0058). Inversely, advanced-stage disease was a strong predictor of greater posttransplantation relapse (RR = 3.48; 95% CI = 1.26- 9.60; P = .0159), worse LFS (RR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.33-4.95; P = .0050), and worse OS (RR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.39-5.53; P = .0038). A high number of CD3(+) cells (> 177 x 10(6)/kg) given to patients resulted in statistically less TRM and more intensive graft versus leukemia effect without producing more severe grades of GVHD, all resulting in a significantly better overall clinical outcome from haploidentical transplantation.
