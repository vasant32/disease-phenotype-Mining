Cytogenetic and bone marrow culture studies were performed sequentially in 13 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who responded to low dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) treatment (complete in nine and partial in four patients). Of nine patients with initial clonal karyotypic abnormalities, six recovered a normal karyotype after attaining a response to treatment, but the other three patients retained partial or total karyotypic abnormalities. A new clonal karyotypic abnormality appeared after treatment in one patient. Eight patients showed normal colony growth of both granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units after treatment, but five were still defective. There was a clear difference in the duration of response to treatment between these two groups. Consolidation treatment was not effective in patients with persistent karyotypic abnormalities or defective colony formation. Although the number of patients studied is small, these results suggest that hemopoiesis in patients with MDS following a response to treatment with low dose Ara-C is heterogeneous. Consolidation chemotherapy is recommended to ensure and prolong the response in patients showing normalization of both cytogenetic and bone marrow culture results.
