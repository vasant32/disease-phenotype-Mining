 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA in childhood myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and to evaluate WT1 as a tool to differentiate MDS from aplastic anemia(AA). METHODS: The quantitative expression of WT1 transcript by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was performed in the bone marrow samples of 36 childhood MDS and 49 childhood AA, the samples were collected from September 2008 to December 2011. RESULTS: (1) The positive rate of WT1 in severe AA (SAA) was 0, 14.3% in chronic AA (CAA), 58.6% in refractory cytopenia (RC), 100% in refractory anemia with excessive blast (RAEB) and 97.5% in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mean level of WT1 in SAA, CAA, RC, RAEB and AML was 0.041%, 0.357%, 7.037%, 12.680% and 24.210%, respectively. The positive rate of WT1 in RC patients was higher than that of SAA (P = 0.000) and CAA (P = 0.001). (2) The positive rate of WT1 in patients with hypoplastic MDS was 66.7% and was higher than that of SAA (P = 0.000) and CAA (P = 0.001). The mean level of WT1 in patients with hypoplastic MDS was (3.022 ± 5.040)% and higher than that of SAA \[(0.041 ± 0.047)%, P = 0.000\] and CAA\[(0.351 ± 0.479)%, P = 0.002\]. CONCLUSIONS: The level of WT1 in childhood MDS was higher than that of childhood AA. The degree of WT1 expression in MDS increased during disease progression. WT1 is a useful tool for differentiating the childhood hypoplastic MDS from AA.
