We have studied the clinical effect of lomefloxacin (LFLX) for the documented infections in the patients with hematological disorders, and also analyzed the prophylactic usefulness of LFLX for the prevention of succeeding infection after the chemotherapy. Fifty five patients were entered in the trial, and 51 patients were eligible. Among 51 eligible patients, 40 patients were suffered from accompanied infections, and 11 patients were registered for the prophylaxis of the infection. In the group of documented infection, the ratio of out-patients was 62.5%, and 63.0% in prophylactic usage. In the treatment of the documented infection, LFLX was effective in 20 patients; the efficacy rate was 50.0%. In the prophylactic administration, LFLX was effective in 9 patients, yielded the efficacy rate of 81.8%. LFLX was effective for all 5 patients with urinary tract infection, in 10 out of 18 patients with respiratory tract infection (efficacy rate; 55.6%), in 5 out of 12 patients with fever from undetermined origin (41.7%), showed no effect for cholecystitis, colitis, and phlegmon. Bacteriological examinations revealed that all of the bacteria detected as pathogens were eradicated. The efficacy rate in the group of the malignant disorders such as leukemia/ lymphoma was smaller than that of non-tumorigenic diseases as aplastic anemia. As myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), four infection-bearing patients and five patients with prophylactic usage were analyzed. The efficacy rate of LFLX was 50.0 and 80.0%, respectively, and the overall efficacy rate was 66.7%. All MDS patients without prophylactic administration failed to have infections. Thus, LFLX was thought to be useful in the prevention of succeeding infections after the chemotherapy. No clinical and laboratory adverse reactions were reported.
