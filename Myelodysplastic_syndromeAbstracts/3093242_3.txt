The separate effects of vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and 13-cis retinoic acid on the differentiation in liquid culture of marrow cells from seven patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were studied. Following incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, an increasing number of myeloid cells acquired the morphological appearance of mature monocyte-macrophages and reacted positively to fluoride-sensitive naphthyl acetate esterase and specifically bound My4 monoclonal antibody (McAb). Incubation of bone marrow cells with 13-cis retinoic acid enhanced the number of cells with the morphological appearance of metamyelocytes and mature granulocytes as well as those that reacted positively with AS-D naphthol chloroacetate esterase. The results suggest that the differentiation pattern of myeloid precursor cells from MDS patients can be modulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and 13-cis retinoic acid.
