An 83-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea and abnormal shadows on chest X-ray films during corticosteroid therapy for organizing pneumonia. He was diagnosed as having disseminated cryptococcosis with pulmonary lesions after detecting Cryptococcus neoformans. Both bilateral pleural effusion with or without ipsilateral pulmonary lesions and ascites ensued, and it was assumed that both direct involvement and serositis were associated with the fluid accumulation. Cryptococcal yeast was only detected in the right pleural effusion, and the titer of cryptococcal antigen was quite different between body cavities, even though it was positive in all sites.
