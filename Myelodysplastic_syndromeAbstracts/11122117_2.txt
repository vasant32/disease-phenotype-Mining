The development of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukaemia (MDS/AML) has been reported in patients with aplastic anaemia (AA) after administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Similarly, patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) have an increased risk of developing MDS/AML after treatment with rhG-CSF. Point mutations in the G-CSF receptor gene are found in about 20% of SCN patients who are predisposed to MDS/AML. We investigated the occurrence of mutations in the G-CSF receptor in eight patients with AA who developed MDS/AML. No mutations were detected around the cytoplasmic domain of the gene in our patients, indicating that the mechanisms of clonal evolution to MDS/AML in patients with AA might be different from those with SCN.
