Lenalidomide is known to be effective in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with del(5q) in improving anemia and suppressing del(5q) cells. MDS with del(5q) shows increase of nonlobulated megakaryocytes. However, histopathology of MDS with del(5q) treated with lenalidomide has not been fully studied. We investigated the morphologic changes in lenalidomide treated low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS with del(5q). All of evaluable patients showed high proportion of nonlobulated megakaryocytes. The nonlobulated megakaryocytes were markedly decreased in 6 patients during therapy in parallel with suppression of del(5q) cells. Our analysis suggests that single allele deletion of common deleted region inhibits nuclear lobulation of megakaryocytes.
