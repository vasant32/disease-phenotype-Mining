Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a rare extramedullary tumor composed of myeloblasts and other granulocytic precursors. GS is mostly associated with myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. These tumors arise in the absence of leukaemia, at its initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence. The most common sites of involvement are bone, skin, soft tissue and lymph node. Reports of GS in testis are very rare. We report an unusual case of GS in a patient with megakaryoblastic leukaemia arising in the left testis after four months in complete remission attained with low doses of Ara-C and granulomonocytic stimulating factor.
