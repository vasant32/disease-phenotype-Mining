We determined the intracellular expression and inducibility of heat shock proteins (Hsps) 72, 73 and 27 in the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and controls. Hsps were overexpressed in MDS marrow especially in advanced disease, providing resistance to induction of apoptosis. These data suggest that Hsps could be implicated in the progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia.
