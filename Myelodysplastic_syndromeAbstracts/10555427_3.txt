OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Acquired Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (AATT), possible aetiology, course and prognosis. DESIGN: Retrospectively diagnosed patients, treated and followed prospectively. SETTING: Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty patients with thrombocytopenic purpura. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to treatment and course of disease. RESULTS: Out of 22 patients 2 died of cerebral haemorrhage, one transformed to Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), one transformed to Acute Myeloid Levkaenia (AML). None is transfusion independent. CONCLUSION: AATT is not an infrequent disorder. It shows poor response to all available therapeutic modalities and has a potential for transformation into Myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia.
