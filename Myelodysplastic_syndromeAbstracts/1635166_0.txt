Myelodysplastic syndromes that occurred in two young brothers are reported. A 19-year-old man was admitted to Kobe City General Hospital in May 1990 because of fever and nasal bleeding. On admission his hemoglobin was 5.5 g/dl, platelet count 1.5 x 10(4)/microliters and white cell count 1,700/microliters with 18% neutrophils and 80% lymphocytes. Bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic features of trilineage blood cells with 4.8% myeloblasts. A diagnosis of refractory anemia was made. His younger brother, a 17-year-old man was examined in May 1990 because of increasing fatigability of 2 years' duration. His hemoglobin was 8.7 g/dl, platelet count 2.1 x 10(4)/microliters and white cell count 2,800/microliters. Bone marrow aspirate revealed morphological abnormalities in three lineages with 5.2% myeloblasts. He was diagnosed as having refractory anemia with excess of blasts. Their parent are consanguineous. The onset at a young age, reduced CD4 lymphocytes and similarity of dyshematopoietic findings suggests the presence of common genetic disorder in the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells.
