A comparison of three different approaches to detect MDR1 expression in myeloid leukemia cells was undertaken. With respect to the 4 different antibodies studied, a high proportion of false positive reactions were detected. Substantial discordance between MDR1 expression as indicated by Northern blot analysis, PCR, and immunohistochemistry was found. These findings complicate the clinical interpretation of data derived from these methods.
