The der(16)t(1;16)(q11;q11) is a frequent recurrent rearrangement in solid tumours such as breast carcinomas and Ewings sarcomas. Recently, this abnormality was described also in multiple myeloma. We identified a der(16)t(1;16)(q11;q11) in three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, either during preleukaemic phase (n = 2) or at the time of blastic transformation (n = 1). Breakpoints were ascertained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific centromeric alpha-satellite probes and whole chromosome painting for chromosome 1 and chromosome 16. These observations, combined with isolated cases of the literature, suggest that der(16)t(1;16)(q11; q11) is a nonrandom abnormality associated with myelodysplastic syndromes.
