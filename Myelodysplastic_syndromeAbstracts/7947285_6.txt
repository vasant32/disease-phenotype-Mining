A patient with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who developed a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is described. After the onset of myelodysplasia the neutrophils of the patient fully expressed GPI-linked proteins. It is concluded that the myelodysplasia does not originate from transformed PNH stem cells, but represents the emergence of a separate clone arising from an injured marrow.
