Balanced chromosome rearrangements are the hallmark of therapy-related leukemia that develops in patients treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors. Many of these rearrangements involve recurrent chromosomal sites and associated genes (11q23/MLL, 21q22.3/AML1, and 11p15/NUP98), which can interact with a variety of partner genes. One such rearrangement is the rare t(1;11)(q23;p15), which involves juxtaposition of the homeobox gene PMX1 (PRRX1) and NUP98. We report on an additional patient with t(1;11) who presented with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subsequent to treatment for a pleomorphic liposarcoma. With time, the patient's disorder progressed to acute myelomonocytic leukemia with cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient presenting with a myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated t(1;11) (q23;p15), which evolved into therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). This patient is the third reported with this cytogenetic rearrangement and t-AML, and is compared with the other two reports of t(1;11)(q23;p15).
