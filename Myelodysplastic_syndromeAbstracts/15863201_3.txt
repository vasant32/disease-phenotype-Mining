We report here a retrospective analysis of 36 children with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 in Japan. Their median age was 7.7 years and the median latency period for the development of t-MDS was 38.5 months. The primary tumors were hematologic in 15 of the cases and nonhematologic in 21. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 32/34(94%) patients: abnormalities of chromosomes 5and/or 7 in 41% and notably, 11q23 abnormalities in 31%. The prognosis of children with t-MDS was very poor as compared to children with primary MDS (5 year survival: 16% versus 54%, p<0.0001).
