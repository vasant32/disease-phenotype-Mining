There is a paucity of epidemiological data on chronic myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), while subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rarely defined. We identified 2,112 adult myeloid malignancies in the South Thames area between 1999 and 2000. The incidence (European standard population) of AML was 3.00/100,000, that of MDS 3.47/100,000, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 0.46/100,000, idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) 0.37/100,000, polycythemia vera (PV) 1.08/100,000, primary thrombocythemia (PT) 1.65/100,000 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 1.09/100,000. The 3-year survival for AML was 15%, MDS 45%, CMML 29%, IMF 48%, PV 80%, PT 81% and CML 50% We believe this study reflects the true incidence and outcome of myeloid malignancies in South East England.
