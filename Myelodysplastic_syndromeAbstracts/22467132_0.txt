Our analysis reported here, is the first one in the world to make a nationwide-level estimate on numbers of visceral mycoses in case of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)in Japan. The data on visceral mycoses in cases reported in the" Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan" published by the Japanese society of pathology in 2002 and 2006, and the data in the vital statics in Japan published by Ministry of health, labour and welfare were analyzed epidemiologically. The estimated numbers of visceral mycoses were 2,250 out of the estimated total death 8,976 in 2001, and 2290 out of 9,805 in 2005, respectively, in cases of leukemia and MDS in Japan. Furthermore, the estimated severe cases that we thought direct cause of death were 1,454 in 2001, and 1,464 in 2005, respectively. In the severe cases, the most causative agents were Aspergillus. The estimated numbers of Candida and Zygomycetes were interestingly almost same in the severe cases, but the lethal rate in Zygomycetes was about 60-80 % , almost twice as that in Candida. We think it is imperative to continuously survey and watch these rates towards the future.
