We aimed to perform a prospective analysis of the main characteristics of deaths occurring in the oncohaematology department of a general hospital. From November 1995 to February 1997, a total of 81 patients died in our unit, 50 of whom (61.7%) were male. Their mean age was 67.8 (range 19-96) years. Underlying diseases were: multiple myeloma (9 cases), acute myeloid leukaemia (22), lymphoma (14), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (6), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (4), myelodysplastic syndromes (3), solid tumours (11), and other (12). The previous disease duration ranged from 5 days to 276 months (mean 31.9 months). The duration of the last hospital stay varied between 0 (death on arrival or on way to hospital) and 40 days (mean 9.3 days). Two patients died in the emergency unit just before entering our department (1 suicide). Only 15 patients had been admitted for the first time. In 70% of these cases death appeared predictable, as the consequence of refractory or end-stage disease. In these cases, all the "do not resuscitate" orders were in place at least 48 h before death. About half the patients died without any relative present. The frequencies of the clinical complaints evaluated were the following: pain necessitating opiates 27%; infection- or disease-related fever 40%; dyspnoea 44%; haemorrhage 20%; CNS disturbances 25%. The percentages of use of therapy tools chosen as indicators were: benzodiazepines 80%; chemotherapy 46%; anti-infectious agents 47%; transfusions 42%; major analgesics 27%; and steroids 40%. The circumstances and quality of patient deaths must be regularly evaluated so that palliative care in the final stages of life can be improved.
