The microRNA/miR system might contribute to deregulation of cell homeostasis/disease phenotype. This is the first approach to generate an expression profile of 365 microRNAs in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with normal karyotype (n=12) and distinct cytogenetic aberrations (n=12). In MDS-del(5q), a series of microRNAs not in the 5q-region was increased. MicroRNAs encoded on chromosomes 5, 7 and 8 were not differentially expressed in MDS with del(5q), -7 or +8. Evaluation in a larger cohort could confirm the up-regulation of the miR-1 in MDS. These findings provide evidence that MDS-haematopoiesis is distinct in its microRNA-expression pattern from non-neoplastic cells.
