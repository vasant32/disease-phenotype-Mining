The efficacy and toxicity of amifostine (300 mg/m(2) three times a week for three consecutive weeks for a maximum of six courses) was evaluated in 12 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes. Dose escalation up to 400 mg/m(2) was allowed to patients who failed to respond. Hemoglobin concentration was increased > or = 1.5 g/dl in two (18%) of the 11 anemic patients. These two patients obtained transfusion independence for 20 weeks. Reticulocyte counts and ANC increased > or = 50% of baseline in four (44%) of the nine patients with reticulocytopenia and in three (25%) of the 12 neutropenic patients. Platelet count increased in three (50%) of the six patients with thrombocytopenia. Progenitor growth of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es improved in 8/12 patients. No major side effects were observed. In conclusion amifostine is well tolerated and can promote the growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitors and ameliorate the cytopenias in MDS patients.
