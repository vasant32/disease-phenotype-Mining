1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate (fosteabine) was administered orally to patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, acute leukemia derived from RAEB and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, in an early phase II study in a multi-institutional study. Among 62 evaluable patients, 2 patients achieved a complete remission, 6 a good response and 8 partial response by daily oral administration of 100-200 mg of fosteabine. The overall response rate was 25.8%. The response rates were almost the same among the four subtypes of MDS. Responses were reached 2-23 weeks (median, 8 weeks) after the start of therapy and continued for 3-50 weeks (median, 10 weeks). Major side effects were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicities. In spite of the disadvantages, such as unpredictable absorption, this newly developed orally administrable cytarabine analogue will be a useful drug in the treatment of MDS.
