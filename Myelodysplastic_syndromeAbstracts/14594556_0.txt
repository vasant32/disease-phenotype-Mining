Excessive apoptosis has a central role in ineffective hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The aim of the study was to quantify apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression in patients with MDS and to use these parameters in the evaluation of treatment efficacy with compounds modulating proapoptotic cytokines. Bone marrow (BM) samples from eight MDS patients were studied: four with refractory anemia and four with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. Two patients with Hodgkin disease without BM determination were studied for control. Therapy consisted in administration of pentoxyphylline, dexamethasone and ciprofloxacin. Biochemical assay of apoptosis and Bcl-2 was performed using annexin V-biotin conjugate antibody and anti-human Bcl-2 antibody respectively, followed by streptavidine-peroxidase conjugate, and peroxidase substrate. Ultrastructural investigation of BM samples was performed with standard electron microscopy techniques. Most of BM hematopoietic cells in the MDS patients had ultrastructural features of various stages of apoptosis including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasm condensation and budding of nuclear and plasma membranes to produce apoptotic bodies. Bcl-2 expression showed an inverse correlation with the rate of the apoptotic process. Periodic evaluation of these two parameters has shown an increase of Bcl-2 expression and a decrease of apoptotic rate in patients who had responded to the treatment. Response to the treatment was appreciated in accordance with their transfusion needs. Treatment efficiency diminished in time. The rate of apoptosis was inversely correlated with the level of Bcl-2 expression. These results confirm the importance of the apoptotic process evaluation in monitoring MDS treatment.
