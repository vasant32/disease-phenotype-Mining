Unrelated cord blood (UCB) is being used as a source of alternative hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation with increasing frequency. From November 1994 to February 1999, 30 UCB transplant procedures were performed for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases in 27 children, aged 0.4 to 17.1 years. Patients received either HLA-matched (n = 3) or 1- or 2-antigen-mismatched (n = 27) UCB following 1 of 2 standardized preparative and graft-versus-host disease regimens (hyperfractionated total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin [ATG] with cyclosporine A and methotrexate; or busulfan, melphalan, and ATG with cyclosporine A and prednisone). The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 27 days (12-60 days) and 75 days (33-158 days) posttransplantation, respectively. No correlation was noted between neutrophil and platelet engraftment and nucleated cells per kilogram, CD34(+) cells per kilogram infused, or cytomegalovirus status of recipient. The cumulative probability of acute grade 2 or greater graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 37.2%, and of grade 3 or greater GVHD was 8.8%. No patients developed chronic GVHD. CD4, CD19, and natural killer cell recovery was achieved at a median of 12, 6, and 2 months, respectively. CD8 recovery was delayed at a median of 9 months. Normal mitogen response was achieved at 6 to 9 months. The probability of survival, disease-free survival, and event-free survival at 1 year was 52.3% (34.1%-70.5%), 54.7% (34.5%-74.9 %) and 49.6% (29.9%-69.4%), respectively. This series of 30 UCB transplants suggests that although CD8 cell recovery is delayed, the pattern of immune reconstitution with UCB is similar to that reported for other stem cell sources.
