Numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities are common in hematological malignancies. Near-triploidy (58-80 chromosomes) is a numerical abnormality observed in 3% of adult cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Near-triploidy is rare in myeloid lineage hematologic malignancies and compared to near-triploidy in lymphoid malignancies, near-triploidy in myeloid malignancies is associated with poor outcomes. Few studies on near-triploidy in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported, and the clinicopathologic significance of this condition is still unclear. Here, we report a novel case of MDS with near-triploidy and multiple structural chromosomal abnormalities: del(5q) combined with del(1p) and del(13q). These abnormalities were detected by cytogenetic analysis with array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Our results suggest that array CGH can be a useful tool for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in patients with MDS.
