A case of myelodysplasia (refractory anaemia with excessive blasts) arising 7 years after a 3 year period of intermittent monthly treatment cycles with melphalan for multiple myelomas is reported. This is another example of preleukaemic syndrome possibly caused by melphalan. Among the possible pathogenetic mechanisms, the incidence of cyclic episodes of medullary hypoplasia are emphasised.
