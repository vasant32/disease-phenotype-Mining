20 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients were treated with Yisuikang (YSK) including MDS-RA 17 cases, MDS-RAEB 2 cases, MDS-RAEB-T 1 case. 14 patients were treated with YSK only, 6 cases were treated with both YSK and Western medicine. The result showed that 4 cases were remitted, 5 cases markedly improved, 6 cases improved and 5 cases ineffective, the total effective rate was 75.0%. It was found that YSK was effective in the treatment of MDS-RA or Qi-Blood Deficiency and Yu-Re Syndrome in TCM, while any other types were ineffective. They also found that types of TCM might be correlated with MDS.
