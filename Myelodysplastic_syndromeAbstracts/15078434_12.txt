Zygomycosis often requires aggressive surgical and antifungal therapy. We report a non-neutropenic patient with myelodysplastic syndrome and iron overload receiving cytotoxic therapy who presented with pulmonary Rhizopus oryzae infection. This patient was cured through the use of itraconazole alone and the literature on the utility of azole antifungals for zygomycosis is reviewed.
