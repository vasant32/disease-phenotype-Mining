Relapsing polychondritis is a rare condition characterized by inflammation and subsequent degeneration of cartilages. Deformity of the pinna, nasal saddling and stridor due to involvement of the cartilages of the respiratory tract may lead to patients being referred to the otolaryngologist for initial assessment and further management. Recent observations have suggested that relapsing polychondritis may occur as a paraneoplastic phenomenon in cases of myelodysplasia. The case of a patient with relapsing polychondritis, myelodysplastic syndrome and a monoclonal gammopathy is presented. The authors highlight the apparent existence of this association and encourage otolaryngologists to consider such possible links when cases of relapsing polychondritis present to the outpatients department.
