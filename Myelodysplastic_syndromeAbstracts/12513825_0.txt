The phenotypes of the bone marrow cells in various subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and its clinical implication were explored. The antigen expression of a panel of antigens expressed in marrow cells from 30 patients with subtypes of MDS was assayed by alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method. The results showed that the expression of myeloid antigens appeared abnormality, CD13 and CD33, found on granulocyte and macrophage precursors, increased, and CD15 decreased. There were no significant changes for monocytic antigen CD14 and lymphoid antigens CD7 and CD10. CD34 was increased in RAEB/RAEB-t and was not increased in RA/RAS patients. CD71, expressed by erythroblast and proliferative cells, was higher in all subtypes of MDS than that in control group. It is suggested that the bone marrow cells from MDS patients showed abnormality of more than two series of immunophenotypes, detection of immunophenotype in MDS cells might be contributed to the diagnosis and predicting prognosis.
