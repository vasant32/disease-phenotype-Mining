To better understand the role of trisomy 8 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we performed a multiparameter analysis combining conventional chromosome studies (CCS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and bone marrow (BM) culture studies in two patients with MDS evolving into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A mosaicism of a cytogenetically normal clone and a clone with trisomy 8 was detected in both patients throughout the course of the disease, a finding confirmed by FISH on BM cells. The relative size of the trisomic clone increased from 52% to 71% (p < 0.0001) and from 53% to 69% (p = 0.001) of all BM cells at the time of the leukemic switch in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Combined FISH and immunophenotyping of BM cells showed involvement of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 1 and involvement of erythroid cells as well as of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 2. Only disomic lymphocytes were detected in both patients. FISH on single hemopoietic colonies grown in semisolid media detected trisomic CFU-GM and disomic BFU-E in patient 1, whereas a proportion of CFU-GM and BFU-E deriving from the trisomic clone was detected in patient 2. However, the percent of trisomic colonies was lower than the percent of involved granulomonocyte precursors and involved erythroblasts, as detected by combined FISH and immunophenotyping on fresh BM samples. We have thus shown heterogeneity of lineage involvement by trisomy 8 in MDS undergoing transformation into AML. Although preferential growth of disomic clones may occur in vitro, the finding of an increased size of the trisomic clone at the time of leukemic switch suggests that these cells had proliferative advantage in vivo over cells without trisomy 8.
