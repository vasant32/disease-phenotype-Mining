 OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of fertility preservation in a premenarcheal female by use of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and oocyte cryopreservation. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Reproductive endocrinology and infertility unit of a tertiary care university-based medical center. PATIENT(S): A 13-year-old premenarcheal female with Tanner stage 3 breast development and Tanner stage 1 pubic hair diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, referred by her medical oncologist for fertility preservation before undergoing a potentially sterilizing antineoplastic therapy. INTERVENTION(S): Evaluation of ovarian reserve, ovarian stimulation, transvaginal oocyte aspiration, in vitro maturation of immature oocytes, and oocyte cryopreservation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cryopreservation of mature oocytes. RESULT(S): Successful controlled ovarian hyperstimulation allowed for the cryopreservation of 18 mature oocytes before the patient's gonadotoxic treatment. The oocyte retrieval and cryopreservation did not delay the patient's planned chemotherapy. CONCLUSION(S): Ovarian stimulation and oocyte cryopreservation can be successfully performed in premenarcheal/peripubertal patients, thus providing a viable alternative to ovarian tissue freezing for fertility preservation in the pediatric population.
