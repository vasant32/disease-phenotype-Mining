We have employed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with standard morphology (MGG/FISH) to identify the clonal involvement of different bone marrow cell lineages in 20 AML patients (14 MDS-AML, 6 de novo AML). Even though the number of cells belonging to the abnormal clone varied between individual cases, the percentage of clonal blasts was similar in MDS-AML and de novo AML patients. The erythropoietic cells appeared to be part of the abnormal clone in 13 of 14 patients with MDS-AML, but only in 1 of 6 with de novo AML. Similarly, clonal granulocytes were detected in 13 of 14 patients with MDS-AML, compared to 2 of 6 with de novo AML. Lymphocytes consistently displayed normal, diploid karyotype. The results suggest that it is possible to distinguish between MDS-AML and de novo AML by the use of MGG/FISH; in de novo AML the abnormal chromosomal clone is generally confined to the immature myeloid cells, while in MDS-AML mature granulocytes and erythroid cells are of clonal origin. It is, however, not possible to conclude that MDS-AML is a "multipotent" type of leukaemia, since it cannot be ruled out that the chromosomally aberrant erythroid cells and granulocytes represent surviving cells from the original MDS clone.
