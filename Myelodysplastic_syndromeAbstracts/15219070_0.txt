Hemoglobin and myoglobin heme pigments and iron have acute and chronic nephrotoxic effects, which are often associated with massive hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. We report a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype who developed an acute renal failure after a severe haemolytic crisis. There was not evidence of renal vascular pathology, urinary tract obstruction or prerenal factors. Renal biopsy showed features of acute tubular necrosis, with extended iron deposits in tubule cell cytoplasm and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and atrophy. The patient was oliguric requiring hemodialisys during three weeks, recovering renal function on the fourth week after admission. This case underlines the nephrotoxic role of heme pigment and iron, and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in acute and chronic toxicity of both agents are reviewed.
