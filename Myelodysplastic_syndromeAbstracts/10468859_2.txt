A 53-year-old female who developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after chemotherapy for adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) is described. The latent period of therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) from the time of diagnosis of ATL was approximately 35 months. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis of t-MDS revealed a clonal abnormality; 46,XX,add(7)(p13), der(17)t(3;17)(p11;p13). Although monoclonal integration of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA was detected in the peripheral blood lymphocytes at ATL diagnosis, bone marrow cells at t-MDS diagnosis did not show monoclonal integration of HTLV-I. To our knowledge, this is the first report of t-MDS associated with ATL.
