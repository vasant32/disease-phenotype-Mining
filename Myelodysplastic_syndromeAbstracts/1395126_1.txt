Serological evidence is presented for the fact that patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome exhibit a statistically significant reactivity in confirmatory assays for antibodies to human T-lymphotropic viruses types I and II (HTLV-I/II). This antibody reactivity, evident by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, was not confined to HTLV core antigens but extended to native and recombinant envelope glycoproteins. The effect was also observed in cases of acute myeloic leukemia, albeit to a lesser degree. It was essentially absent from patients with chronic myeloic leukemia or lymphocytic leukemias and healthy or multitransfused controls. No antibodies to human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 or 2 were detected in any of the specimens. The investigated clinical population had no known risk factor for retroviral infection other than a history of multiple platelet transfusions, and none of the specimens was seropositive for HTLV-I or HTLV-II according to recommended criteria. The cause of this cross-reactivity remains to be determined.
