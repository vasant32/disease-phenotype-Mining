 OBJECTIVE: To analysis the relationship among cytogenetics, morphology and prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. METHODS: Cytogenetics analysis of bone marrow cells was performed by direct method and/or 24 h culture method. The karyotype was analysed by R banding technique. RESULTS: Out of the 50 MDS patients, 22 were found with abnormal karyotype: two of them were +8, four of them were -7, four of them were 5q-, nine of them were 7q-, two of them were 20q- and one of them was 6q-. There are six patients had complex changes in chromosome. CONCLUSION: 5q-, -7, 7q- are the most classic translocation in the MDS. The patients with 5q- have better prognosis and the patients with -7, 7q- have worse prognosis. Cytogenetics is very important in the MDS's diagnosis, progress and prognosis.
