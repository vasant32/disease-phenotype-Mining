We report the case of a 59 year old man presenting a regenerative microcytic hypochromic anaemia. The investigations revealed the presence of haemoglobin H, suggesting abnormalities in the alpha-globin chains synthesis. Alpha-thalassemia was thus suspected. The patient had no personal or familial history. The association with aniso-poÃ¯kilocytosis and a marked iron overload (ferritinemia > 1,500 microg/L) suggested a myelodysplastic syndrome, which was confirmed with a bone marrow aspiration. The pattern was consistent with the Acquired alpha-Thalassemia-Myelodysplastic Syndrome (ATMDS). About a hundred cases are listed worldwidely and collected in an international registry. The causes of ATMDS are ignored, but recent reports indicate that the ATRX gene may be implicated in the pathogenesis. ATRX is a chromatin-associated protein, involved in the transcription of several genes. The alpha globin genes could be one of the targets of the ATRX protein.
