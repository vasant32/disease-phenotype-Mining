The common dilemma in the treatment of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is whether to use intensive myelosuppresive therapy with higher risk of treatment related mortality (TRM), but a chance for complete remission (CR), or to treat less intensively in order to prolong survival time with a better quality of life. The aim of this prospective, phase II study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of low dose combination induction treatment consisted of cytarabine at a dose of 10 mg/m2 every 12 h s.c. for 7 days, VP-16 at a dose of 100 mg/day p.o. for 7 days and mitoxantrone at a dose of 6 mg/m2 i.v daily on days 1-3. Two induction courses were planned. In the group of 44 patients 12 (27%) achieved CR, 4 (9%) patients were in PR and there were 9 (20%) early deaths (ED). Age, performance status, preceding myelodysplastic syndrome, karyotype, WBC and % of blasts in bone marrow were not significant prognostic factors for CR probability. The following initial factors appeared to be related to a shorter duration of survival time from the start of treatment: age >70 (p<0.03), poor performance status (p<0.03), and % of BM blasts 50 (p<0.05). We conclude that, despite promising results in the pilot study the efficacy of this induction treatment is not better than the efficacy of other regimens. The hematological toxicity of this treatment seems to be comparable with "3+7" regimen.
