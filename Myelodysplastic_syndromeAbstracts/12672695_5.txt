Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a hematopoietic disorder characterized by neutropenia in peripheral blood and maturation arrest of neutrophil precursors in bone marrow. Patients with SCN may evolve to have myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelocytic leukemia. In approximately 20% of SCN cases, a truncation mutation is found in the cytoplasmic region of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). We then generated mice carrying murine wild-type G-CSFR and its mutants equivalent to truncations at amino acids 718 and 731 in human G-CSFR, those were reported to be related to leukemic transformation of SCN. Although numbers of peripheral white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets did not differ among mutant and wild-type G-CSFR transgenic (Tg) mice, both of the mutant receptor Tg mice had one third of peripheral neutrophil cell counts compared with wild-type receptor Tg mice. The mutant receptor Tg mice also showed impaired resistance to the infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, bone marrow of these Tg mice had an increased percentage of immature myeloid cells, a feature of SCN. This maturation arrest was also observed in in vitro cultures of bone marrow cells of truncated G-CSFR Tg mice under G-CSF stimulation. In addition, clonal culture of bone marrow cells of the truncated G-CSFR Tg mice showed the hypersensitivity to G-CSF in myeloid progenitors. Our Tg mice may be useful in the analysis of the role of truncated G-CSFR in SCN pathobiology.
