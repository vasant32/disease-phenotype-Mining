 AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of pancreatic ultrasonography in diagnosing Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS). METHODS: Diagnostic methods in two infants with SBDS were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Patient 1 first presented with hepatic steatosis in the early infantile period, and later developed myelodysplastic syndrome. Patient 2 presented with frequent infections and elevated liver function tests without any haematological alterations. Both patients were considered to have impaired exocrine pancreatic function. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) obtained at 9 mo for patient 1 and at 10 mo for patient 2 showed diffuse high echogenicity, which raised suspicions of SBDS. SBDS gene analysis confirmed SBDS in both patients. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic US is sensitive in detecting pathological change in SBDS patients. It should be applied to the diagnostic approach for patients who show only minor signs of SBDS.
