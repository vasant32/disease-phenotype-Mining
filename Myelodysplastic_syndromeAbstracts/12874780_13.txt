AML1/RUNX1, located on chromosome band 21q22, is one of the most important hematopoietic transcription factors. AML1 is frequently affected in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome with 21q22 translocations. Recently, AML1 mutations were found in adult hematologic malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M0 or leukemia with acquired trisomy 21, and familial platelet disorder with a predisposition toward AML. Through the use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we examined the AML1 gene for mutations in 241 patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies, and we detected AML1 mutations in seven patients (2.9%). Deletion was found in one patient, and point mutations in four patients, including three missense mutations, two silent mutations, and one mutation within an intron resulting in an abnormal splice acceptor site. All of the mutations except for one were heterozygous. Mutations within the runt domain were found in six of seven patients. Six of seven patients with AML1 mutations were diagnosed with AML, and one had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In three of these seven patients, AML evolved from other hematologic disorders. AML1 mutations were found in two of four AML-M0 and two of three patients with acquired trisomy 21. Patients with AML1 mutations tended to be older children. Three of four patients with AML1 mutations who received stem cell transplantation (SCT) are alive, whereas the remaining three patients with mutations without SCT died. These results suggest that AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies are infrequent, but are possibly related to AML-M0, acquired trisomy 21, and leukemic transformation. These patients may have a poor clinical outcome.
