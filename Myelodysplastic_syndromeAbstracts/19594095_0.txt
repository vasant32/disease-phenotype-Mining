Eighty-four-year-old male patient with liver cirrhosis, suffered from dyspnea on August 2006. Four months later, his symptom has remained and he was admitted to our hospital. A white blood cell decrease and anemia were observed by the blood test. He underwent echocardiography and 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy (99mTc-Tf) at rest, which showed no abnormal cardiac imaging. But 99mTc-Tf whole-body planar imaging showed extremely increased bone marrow uptake. 99mTc-HMDP bone scintigraphy also showed abnormal hot spots in the same skeletal regions. Bone marrow biopsy revealed myelodysplastic syndrome like findings. 201Tl and 99mTc as tracers for myocardial perfusion imagings were used to evaluate coronary heart disease, but increased uptake of these tracers were reported in malignant tumors and bone metastasis. He did not have malignant tumor or bone metastasis, so increased uptake of 99mTc-Tf and 99mTc-HMDP was thought to be caused by hyperactive flow with ineffective hematopoiesis. We report a case that abnormal skeletal uptake of 99mTc-Tf which was caused by ineffective hematopoiesis of myelodysplastic syndrome.
