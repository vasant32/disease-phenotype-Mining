We report the outcome of 16 children with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB; n = 4) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T; n = 12) following induction therapy with etoposide, cytarabine and mitoxantrone (ECM) prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The median observation period was 77 months (range 5-123). Complete remission rate was 81% following induction; no toxic deaths occurred. Eight-year event-free survival and overall survival was 50% and 56%, respectively. None of the three patients with a complex karyotype survived, suggesting karyotype is a crucial prognostic factor for survival. This study indicates the safety and high remission rate of ECM and high survival rates after HSCT for paediatric RAEB and RAEB-T.
