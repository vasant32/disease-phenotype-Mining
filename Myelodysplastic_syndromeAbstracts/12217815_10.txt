We describe a significant increase in the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) in bone marrow cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) compared with normal donor cells. Furthermore, MDS samples with increased NFkappaB activity consistently showed higher mRNA levels of NFkappaB-regulated cytokines.
