A new myeloid cell line, MTO-94, was established from the bone marrow of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MTO-94 cells matured in culture medium without the addition of growth factors, and yielded neutrophils with pseudo-Pelger HuÃ«t anomaly or hypersegmentation until 6 months. Ten months after the start of cell cultivation, MTO-94 consisted of myeloblasts. Surface phenotypes were as follows: CD7 90.3%, CD13 99.6%, CD33 75.6%, HLA-DR 96.3% and CD34 0.9%. The karyotype was 46, XY i(17q). The proliferation of MTO-94 cells was enhanced by rhIL-3, G-CSF, rhGM-CSF and rhSCF but not by rhIL-6 and erythropoietin. MTO-94 cells with i(17q) might be useful in the study of biological aspects of not only MDS, but also hematological malignancies with i(17q) as the sole chromosomal anomaly.
