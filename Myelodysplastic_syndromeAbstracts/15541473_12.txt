Angiogenesis is implicated in the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Bone marrow microvascular density (MVD), serum angiogenin (ANG) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured in 67 patients with untreated MDS. MVD, ANG and IL-6 were significantly higher in the patient group as a whole when compared to controls (P < 0.01). MVD and ANG were significantly higher in subtypes with a high-risk for leukemic transformation (RAEB, RAEB-t and CMML) than in low-risk subtypes (RA and RARS) (P < 0.01). In the MDS group, a positive correlation was found between ANG and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and also between MVD and IL-6 (P < 0.05). Using multivariate analysis, only IL-6 displayed independent prognostic value and was inversely related to MDS survival.
