This study was aimed to examine whether a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and androgen possesses the therapeutic value for the MDS-refractory anemia (MDS-RA), and to analyze the mechanisms in detail. 62 cases receiving a scheme of combination of ATRA, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and androgen (group A) were monitored. The remaining 33 cases (group B) were provided with vitamin supplementation, chalybeate drugs, and one or two of the combination. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed for collecting the specimens at the baseline and afterwards. The conditions of the patients were monitored by means of weekly complete blood counts and the monthly examination, including toxicity test, physical examination, electrocardiography, and biochemistry panel. The results showed that after treating for 8 weeks in group A, 4 out of 62 patients showed complete remission and 12 patients showed partial remission according to the defined response criteria, and 43 patients (69.35%) showed hematological improvement (HI). The further treatment for 16 out of 62 patients (25.81%), 13 failures (10 deaths, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(5)) with a median survival interval of 26.25 months, were observed and interrupted for some reasons. However, partial remission was observed only in 3 patients in group B, and HI amounted to 51.51%. Furthermore, the disease progression was observed in 12 out of 33 patients (36.36%) with a median survival interval of 16 months, 9 failures (including 6 deaths, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(4)). The overall ratios of survival for 3 and 5 years in group A, which received the combination, reached to 69.24% and 53.72% respectively, in comparison with 52.23% and 31.34% in the patients of group B (log-rank, P = 0.016). The following requirements, if were met, would be significant for prognosis: the combination regiment, no transformation, children, no complication, female, 90-120 g/L of hemoglobin concentration, normal cellular bone marrow and uni-cytopenias (P < 0.05). Moreover, Cox regression showed that therapy, transformation and age are all the independent factors (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the combination of above mentioned 3 drugs may be effective and safe treatment for the patients with MDS-RA. Its relevant mechanisms can be involved in the combination, that elicits a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as differentiation, anti-tumor-promotion, anti-apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-cachexia and immunoregulation.
