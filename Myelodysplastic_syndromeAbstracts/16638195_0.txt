To determine the possible roles of survivin in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to explore the relationship between apoptosis and angiogenesis in MDS, the expressions of survivin, Bcl-2 and VEGF were detected in the BM cells of de novo patients with MDS, patients with AML and individuals of control by immunochemical staining and their relationship was analyzed. The results showed that the expression rate and integral of all the three proteins in the low-risk group of MDS, high-risk group of MDS and de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients gradually increased, in addition to expression of Bcl-2 in low-risk group of MDS and control group. The significant differences were observed in every two groups and there were positive relations between the every two proteins. It is concluded that survivin, Bcl-2 and VEGF are all involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, and related with the progression of this disease, the deregulated apoptosis and angiogenesis may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS through interaction among three proteins mentioned above.
