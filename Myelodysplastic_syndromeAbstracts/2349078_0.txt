The premature chromosome condensation technique allows cytogenetic studies (chromosomes scoring or karyotyping after banding) of mature non cycling cells. In conjunction with cell fractionation, it appears a powerful tool to study spontaneous or therapy-induced maturation of cells of acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients. It is useful for determining the involvement of multiple lineages in hematopoietic diseases.
