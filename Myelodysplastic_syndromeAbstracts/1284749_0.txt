In a retrospective study we investigated the development of HLA antibodies in patients who received platelet concentrates from cell separators. 118 hematological/oncological patients from the Frankfurt University Clinics were investigated. They received between 4 and 66 platelet concentrates for the duration of 30 months. All patients had a negative antibody screening on admission. 31% developed either transient (15%) or permanent (16%) lymphocytotoxic antibodies. The increasing number of platelet transfusions did not correlate with the development of HLA antibodies, but the appearance of these antibodies seemed to be dependent on the disease. Permanent antibodies appeared in 8% of patients with acute leukemia, whereas 38% of patients suffering from CL, lymphoma, MDS and myeloma produced antibodies. Some patients (18) received granulocyte transfusions as well. It is striking that 11% of these patients developed permanent and 28% transient HLA antibodies. There exist no data about recent transfusions or previous pregnancies. To lower the rate of sensitization in patients with diseases such as CL, lymphoma, MDS and myeloma, it should be discussed whether leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates should be given to these patients.
