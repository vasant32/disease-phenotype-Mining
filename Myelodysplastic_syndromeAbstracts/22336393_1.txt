We report descriptive data of a home care (HC) program, throughout a 5-years period (2006-2010), focusing on the reliability and the safety of transfusions at home in 211 patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Our results outline the potentially relevant role of a specifically dedicated HC service in the global management of frail MDS patients for which transfusions at home may represent a valuable option to maintain a good quality of life and avoid the possible discomfort due to hospital admissions and outpatient visits.
