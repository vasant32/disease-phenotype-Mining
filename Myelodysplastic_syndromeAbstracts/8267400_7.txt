Partial deletion of chromosome 5q (5q-) is a frequent aberration in myelodysplasias and acute nonlymphocytic leukemias. It causes clinical and hematological symptoms termed the 5q-syndrome. Although more than 30 different 5q deletions are described, recent studies have demonstrated 5q31 as the common deleted region and have mapped a tumor suppressor (IRF-1) and a cluster of interleukin genes to 5q31. Furthermore, del(5)(q13q33) is associated with longer survival, which means that 5q segments other than 5q31 also are of importance. These data suggest that loss of the suppressor releases the malignancy, interleukin losses determine the hematology and deletion of other 5q segments affect survival.
