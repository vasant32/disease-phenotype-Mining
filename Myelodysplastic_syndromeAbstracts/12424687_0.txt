BACKGROUND: Cholestasis following bone marrow transplantation is not rare, but should always be a warning signal. The main causes of cholestasis following bone marrow transplantation are hepatotoxic effects of drugs, venoocclusive disease (VOD), early graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), total parenteral nutrition, viral hepatitis, sepsis and opportunistic infections. Vanishing bile duct syndrome represents a very rare cause for cholestatic symptoms. CASE REPORT: We report on a 8-year-old boy suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and developed biliary ductopenia in terms of a vanishing bile duct syndrome. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis for cholestasis following bone marrow transplantation should include the vanishing bile duct syndrome.
