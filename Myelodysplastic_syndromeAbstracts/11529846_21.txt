Human angiogenin is a potent inducer of angiogenesis. The association between angiogenin and cancer progression and poor outcome in solid tumours has been documented, but its significance in leukaemias has not been evaluated. We evaluated plasma angiogenin levels in 101 previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (59 patients) and advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (42 patients). Angiogenin levels were significantly higher in AML and advanced MDS patients than in healthy individuals (P < 0.00001). Angiogenin levels were also significantly higher in advanced MDS than in AML (P = 0.001). Higher levels of angiogenin correlated with prolonged survival periods in both AML and advanced MDS patients (P = 0.02 and 0.01 respectively). We found no correlation between angiogenin plasma level and various patient characteristics, including age, performance status, antecedent haematological disorder, haemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts, and poor prognosis cytogenetics. There was no significant correlation between angiogenin level and complete remission rate and duration in AML or advanced MDS patients. In multivariate analysis, angiogenin concentration retained its significance as a prognostic factor in AML (P = 0.03), together with age (P = 0.00007) and haemoglobin (P = 0.03).
