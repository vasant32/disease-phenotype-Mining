Analyzing bone marrow trephines from (myelodysplastic syndrome) MDS patients we show for the first time strong over-expression of the DNA methyltransferases 1, and 3A (and 3B to a much lesser extent) in the myelodysplastic syndrome FAB subtypes refractory anaemia (RA) and refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). The increase in mRNA expression was much less pronounced in refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Classification according to the new WHO guidelines revealed distinct differences between RCMD and RARS. This elevated mRNA expression most probably contributes to the frequently found aberrant hypermethylation in MDS and might explain the promising clinical response of MDS patients treated with DNMT inhibitors.
