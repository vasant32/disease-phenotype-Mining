The purpose of this investigation was to explore the expression of nm23-H(1) gene in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and evaluate the relationship between nm23-H(1) expression and therapeutic outcomes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of nm23-H(1) mRNA in marrow mononuclear cells from 28 MDS patients and 15 normal subjects. nm23-H(1)/GAPDH ratio >/= 0.5 was believed to a positive case. The expression of nm23-H(1) was positive in 24 of 28 MDS patients, and the average level was 0.89 +/- 0.56. nm23-H(1) mRNA was negative in normal controls. The overexpression of nm23-H(1) mRNA in MDS patients could predict outcome of treatment and prognosis for MDR patients.
