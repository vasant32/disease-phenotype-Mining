Myelodysplastic syndromes (SMD) were studied in 58 patients (37 men, 21 women; mean age 61 years, range 18-81) who were grouped according to FAB criteria (Table 1). None of them showed a secondary SMD to medullary toxic agents or cytostatic treatments although 5 presented concomitant neoplastic disease. Morphologic alterations in peripheral blood smears and bone marrow were registered by 3 hematologists working independently. The intracellular and extracellular iron deposits were evaluated in every case with Perls; peroxidase activity was determined in 16 patients and intraleucocitary alkaline phosphatase reaction was carried out in 17 patients. Twenty five patients (43%) had refractory anemia (RA); 10 (17%) sideroblastic anemia; 13 (25%) refractory anemia with excess of blasts (AREB); 3 (5%) AREB in transformation (AREB-T) and 7 myelomonocytic leukemia (LMMC). Clinical manifestations at diagnosis are described in Table 2. In the observation period there were cases of anemia requiring transfusion, bacterial infections, muco-cutaneous hemorrhage and hemorrhagic episodes in the central nervous system. In the bone marrow smears the cellularity was normal or increased in 53 cases and diminished in only 3. The degree of dysplastic characteristics (erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic) ranged from low to severe. It was low in most of AR, being the erythroid population the most affected in AS and the granulocytic one in AREB and AREB-T. Patients with LMMC showed similar characteristics to those with myeloproliferative syndromes and the differential diagnosis were sometimes difficult, accounting for their separate inclusion in Table 4. Out of 23 patients, 5 presented clonal pathology detected in cytogenetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
