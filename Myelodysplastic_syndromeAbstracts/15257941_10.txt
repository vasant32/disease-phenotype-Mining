Mutations of the NRAS and TP53 genes and internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene are among the most frequently observed molecular abnormalities in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sought to determine the incidence of these abnormalities in patients with MDS and a 5q deletion. NRAS and FLT3 mutations are uncommon in MDS patients with a 5q deletion and TP53 mutation is associated with the more advanced MDS subtypes.
