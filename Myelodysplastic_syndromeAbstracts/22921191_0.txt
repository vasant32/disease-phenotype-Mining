Retrospective analyses suggest iron overload is associated with inferior survival (OS) in lower risk MDS and iron chelation therapy (ICT) with improvement. However, an analysis of RARS patients found no such association. We analyzed subtypes of lower risk MDS. Median OS for non-RARS without and with ICT was 44 months and not reached (P<0.001), and for RARS 99 and 134.4 months (P=NS); in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent RARS patients not receiving ICT, median OS was 73.8 months (P=0.025). These results suggest a stronger association between ICT and OS in non-RARS MDS than in RARS, with significantly superior OS in transfusion dependent patients receiving ICT.
