 SUMMARY: Familial monosomy 7 is defined as bone marrow monosomy 7 occurring as a sole cytogenetic abnormality affecting 2 or more siblings. It manifests usually in childhood with neurologic disorder (cerebellar ataxia or atrophy) and/or hematologic disorder (marrow hypoplasia, myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia, or pancytopenia). Partial or complete monosomy 7 with hematologic disorder has been reported in 13 families/pedigrees to date. Here we report the 14th family.
