These suggested practice guidelines are based on extensive evaluation of the reviewed risk-based data and indicate useful current approaches for managing patients with MDS. Four drugs have recently been approved by the FDA for treating specific subtypes of MDS: lenalidomide for MDS patients with del(5q) cytogenetic abnormalities; azacytidine and decitabine for treating patients with higher-risk or nonresponsive MDS; and deferasirox for iron chelation of iron overloaded patients with MDS. However, because a substantial proportion of patient subsets with MDS lack effective treatment for their cytopenias or for altering disease natural history, clinical trials with these and other novel therapeutic agents along with supportive care remain the hallmark of management for this disease. The role of thrombopoietic cytokines for management of thrombocytopenia in MDS needs further evaluation. In addition, further determination of the effects of these therapeutic interventions on the patient's quality of life is important.(116,119,120,128,129) Progress toward improving management of MDS has occurred over the past few years, and more advances are anticipated using these guidelines as a framework for coordination of comparative clinical trials.
