23 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 8 normal controls were analyzed for dysmegakaryopoiesis (DMP) in the bone marrow by alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique and by conventional May-Giemsa staining. In the immunocytochemical study, monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa was utilized to demonstrate megakaryocytic cells. 91% (21/23) of MDS cases were detected as having DMP by APAAP method, while only 52% (12/23) were detectable by Giemsa stain. There were difficulties in recognizing small micromegakaryocytes (micro MKs), designated as type 1 atypical MKs, by Giemsa staining. Furthermore, megakaryoblasts (MKBs) were detectable only by APAAP technique. In 8 normal controls, no type 1 and type 3 atypical MKs (round shaped multinuclear MKs) were observed either by Giemsa staining or by the APAAP method, suggesting that they are a distinctive feature of MDS. These results indicate the necessity of immunocytochemical technique for accurate recognition of DMP in MDS.
