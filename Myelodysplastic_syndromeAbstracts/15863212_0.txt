The two acute myelomonocytic leukemia sister cell lines MOLM-17 and MOLM-18 and the Epstein-Barr-virus positive non-malignant B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) B422 and B423 were established from the bone marrow sample of a 60-year-old Japanese male in the advanced leukemic phase of refractory anemia with excess of blasts, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MOLM-17/-18 are proliferatively responsive to the growth factors present in the culture supernatant of the 5637 cell line. The B-LCLs are constitutively growth factor-independent. MOLM-17 and B422 were established at eight months after the initial diagnosis, while MOLM-18 and B423 were derived from a sample one month later. Immunophenotyping of the first leukemia sample revealed a mixed lineage leukemia immunophenotype with positivity for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD13 and CD19; the second sample revealed solely myeloid characteristics with positivity for CD13, CD41 and CD61, whereas TdT was negative. MOLM-17/-18 showed immunomarker profiles typical of the myelomonocytic lineage. The karyotype analysis of MOLM-17/-18 revealed various non-random numerical and structural abnormalities including del(5)(q?), -7, der(11)add(11)(p11.2)add(11)(q23), add(17)(p11.2), add(18)(p11.2), -20, -22 as common aberrations. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced pronounced cellular differentiation of both cell lines into macrophage-like cells. The overall profile of MOLM-17/-18 based on their extensive immunological, cytogenetic and functional characterization suggests that these cell lines together with the paired B-LCLs B422 and B423 may represent scientifically significant in vitro models which could facilitate investigations into the pathobiology of MDS.
