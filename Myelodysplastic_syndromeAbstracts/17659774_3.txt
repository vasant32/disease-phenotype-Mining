Enhanced proliferation of MDS progenitors is abrogated by increased apoptosis of their progeny in vivo. We investigated whether bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of MDS patients also showed enhanced proliferation and apoptosis in vitro in comparison with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and normal BM (NBM). NBM showed a decrease in the number of clusters in time due to apoptosis of clusters and due to development of clusters into colonies with low apoptotic level. In MDS patients, about two-fold more clusters have developed at day 4, and in contrast with NBM, the total number of clusters at day 7 remained high in spite of an increasing percentage of apoptotic clusters (from 52 to 76%) in combination with more colony formation. The number of clusters and colonies showed a sharp decrease at day 10 because of persistently high apoptosis at cluster level and increasing apoptosis in colonies. BMMNC of AML patients showed a decreased proliferation with enhanced apoptosis at cluster level in contrast to a relatively low apoptotic levels in the colony-forming cells. This data show that increased proliferation is abrogated by enhanced apoptosis in MDS, whereas AML showed decreased proliferation with a low level of apoptosis in colony-forming cells. These growth profiles of BMMNC are independent of stromal influences and may represent intrinsic features of the MDS progenitors and accessory cell interactions.
