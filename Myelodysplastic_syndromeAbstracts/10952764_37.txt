Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 represents the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) and is also found in other myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Previous studies have identified a common deleted region (CDR) spanning approximately 8 Mb. We have now used G-banding, FISH or microsatellite PCR to analyse 113 patients with a 20q deletion associated with a myeloid malignancy. Our results define a new MPD CDR of 2.7 Mb, an MDS/AML CDR of 2.6 Mb and a combined 'myeloid' CDR of 1.7 Mb. We have also constructed the most detailed physical map of this region to date--a bacterial clone map spanning 5 Mb of the chromosome which contains 456 bacterial clones and 202 DNA markers. Fifty-one expressed sequences were localized within this contig of which 37 lie within the MPD CDR and 20 within the MDS/AML CDR. Of the 16 expressed sequences (six genes and 10 unique ESTs) within the 'myeloid' CDR, five were expressed in both normal bone marrow and purified CD34 positive cells. These data identify a set of genes which are both positional and expression candidates for the target gene(s) on 20q.
