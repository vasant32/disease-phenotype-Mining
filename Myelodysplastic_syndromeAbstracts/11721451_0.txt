 OBJECTIVE: To investigate expression of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1 genes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and post-MDS acute myeloid leukemia (post-MDS AML), and its role in pathogenesis or progression of MDS and post-MDS AML. METHODS: Expression of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1 genes was examined in 31 MDS, 11 post-MDS AML, and 34 de novo AML patients by a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Evi-1 expression was not detected in bone marrow samples of 8 normal controls, but low MDS1-Evi-1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi-1/GAPDH < 0.1) were detected in 3 of the 8 controls. Evi-1 RNA was expressed in 1 of 8 RA, 8 of 13 RAEB and 6 of 9 RAEB-T patients, and the percentage of Evi-1 expression in RAEB(T) patients was higher than that in RA (P < 0.05). MDS1-Evi-1 expression was detected in 5 of 8 RA, 9 of 13 RAEB and 5 of 9 RAEB-T patients, and MDS1-Evi-1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi-1/GAPDH > 0.1) were markedly higher than those in the controls. Evi-1 expression was gradually increased in 4 of 5 RAEB-T patients with transformation from MDS to AML. The percentages of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1 expression in post-MDS AML patients were significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively) higher than those in de novo AML. The colonies of hematopoietic progenitor cells were decreased in Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1-positive MDS patients as compared with those in Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi-1-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of the Evi-1 gene and overexpression of MDS1-Evi-1 gene may play a role in the pathogenesis or progression of MDS and post-MDS AML.
