 BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies in different parts of the world have revealed controversial results on the association between hepatitis C virus infection and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This discrepancy suggests that HCV lymphotropism or its effect on host lymphocytes may be influenced by regional and racial factors, as well as by genomic variations. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HCV infection in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed and treated in our institute in Israel. METHODS: A total of 212 consecutive patients (95 males and 117 females) treated in our hematology outpatient clinic between August 1997 and September 1999 was screened for anti-HCV antibodies and hepatitis B surface antigen. HCV infection was confirmed by the presence of HCV RNA in the serum. The prevalence of HCV in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders was compared to that in a control group of patients with myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. RESULTS: HCV infection was more prevalent in the group of LPD patients than in the control group, but this finding was not statistically significant. The prevalence of HCV among LPD patients was 7.8%, while that in the group with myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders was 1.19% and in the general population 0.64%. Among the different classes of LPD, a significant association with HCV infection was established only in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Furthermore, HCV infection was significantly more prevalent than HBV infection in the LPD group, but not in the myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders group. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of a significant association between HCV infection and diffuse large B cell lymphoma leads us to suggest that anti-HCV antibodies be performed routinely in such subjects.
