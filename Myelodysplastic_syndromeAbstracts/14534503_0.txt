IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE WITH EPOETIN BETA: In a study against a placebo, there was evidence that the quality of life scores were significantly improved in patients treated with epoetin beta, whether they exhibited a solid tumour or a malignant lymphoma. The same was noted in children with cancer exhibiting severe neoplasia and treated with chemotherapy. The efficacy and tolerance to treatment were equivalent, whatever the administration regimen. IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES: A particular entity among malignant blood diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes are at the origin of anaemia against which repeated transfusions and growth factors are proposed with varying results and disadvantages, and against which erythropoietin may be moderately effective (a mean of 25% in non-selected cohorts of patients). DEPENDING ON THE PROTOCOLS OF ERYTHROPOIETIN ADMINISTRATION IN CASES OF MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES: Recombinant human erythropoietin, irrespective of its concentration in myelodysplastic cell culture, does not appear capable of restoring normal erythropoiesis. The influence of prolonged treatment is not admitted by all. The effects of the addition of growth factors (notably G-CSF) are obvious but some are controversial because of the costs and the prolonged duration of such treatments.
