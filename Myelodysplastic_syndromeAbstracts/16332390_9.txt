AG-013736 is an oral anti-angiogenesis agent with activity against a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, c-kit, and PDGFR-beta. A phase 2 study was conducted in patients with poor prognosis AML or MDS. Twelve patients (six AML; six MDS) were treated with AG-013736 at a dose of 10mg orally daily for a median of 56 days (range, 1-248 days). Median age was 80 years (range, 58-88 years). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicities included hypertension (42%), mucositis (8%) and deep venous thrombosis (8%). No objective responses occurred; two patients with MDS had stable disease for 8.3 and 6.2 months, respectively. Bone marrow expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was observed in 11% and 0% of patients, respectively. Sustained decreases in soluble VEGFR-2 plasma levels with concomitant elevation in plasma VEGF and placental growth factor levels were obtained during the course of therapy with AG-013736. AG-01736 had minimal biologic or clinical activity in this elderly patient population.
