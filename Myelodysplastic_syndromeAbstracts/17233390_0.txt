A 74-year-old man had been given a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and had been treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). 1 year later, he suffered from fever and his chest X-ray lung biopsy did not provide a diagnosis, video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed, which yielded a histological diagnosis of organizing pneumonia. His pulmonary disease was diagnosed as secondary organizing pneumonia due to MDS, and was treated successfully with steroids. Vigorous efforts to establish a histological diagnosis is needed for the antibiotics-resistant pneumonia in the case of MDS.
