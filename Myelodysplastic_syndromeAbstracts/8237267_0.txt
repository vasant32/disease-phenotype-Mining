The microcytofluorometrical method was applied to determine the relative hemoglobin (Hb) content in the bone marrow colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) colonies from 6 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 10 healthy subjects. This method relies on a photochemical reaction, by which intracellular Hb is converted into fluorescent porphyrin using a 0.2 M mercaptoethylamine solution (an SH donor) and violet light (lambda = 405 nm). The relative Hb content was determined as a function of the intensity of emitted porphyrin fluorescence. The number of colonies identified by porphyrin fluorescence was smaller in MDS patients than in normal subjects. The relative Hb content was also lower in MDS patients than in normal subjects. In addition, the coefficient of variation of the relative Hb content in the CFU-E colonies was larger in MDS patients than in normal subjects. These findings suggest that colonies with low relative Hb content undergo impaired erythropoiesis and that the CFU-E colonies undergoing the impaired erythropoiesis are mixed with CFU-E colonies showing normal erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of MDS patients.
