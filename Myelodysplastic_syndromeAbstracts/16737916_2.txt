A growing body of literature reports therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) in patients treated successfully for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We report a t-MDS with an isochromosome 1q as a sole abnormality, 47,XY,+1,i(1)(q10), in a 46-year-old man with APL 14 years after he was treated with cytosine arabinosine and daunorubicin. The literature on t-MDS/t-AML after APL therapy and on isochromosome 1q is reviewed.
