The optimal pretransplant regimen for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients ≥ 55 years of age remains to be determined. The myeloablative reduced-toxicity 4-day regimen i.v. busulfan (Bu) (130 mg/m(2)) and i.v. fludarabine (Flu) (40 mg/m(2)) is associated with low morbidity and mortality. We analyzed 79 patients ≥ 55 years of age (median, 58 years) with AML (n = 63) or MDS (n = 16) treated with i.v. Bu-Flu conditioning regimens between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up, 24 months). The patients who received this regimen had a good performance status. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients in first complete remission (CR1), second CR (CR2), or refractory disease and for all patients at time of transplantation were 71%, 44%, 32%, and 46%, respectively; 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates for patients in CR1, CR2, or refractory disease at time of transplantation and for all patients were 68%, 42%, 30%, and 44%, respectively. One-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates for patients who were in CR or who had active disease at the time of transplantation were 19% and 20%, respectively. Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host (aGVHD) disease was diagnosed in 40% of the patients. Our results suggest that age alone should not be the primary reason for exclusion from receiving myeloablative reduced-toxicity conditioning with i.v. Bu-Flu preceding transplantation in patients with AML/MDS.
