Between 1978 and 1996 more than 7500 lymphoma transplants have been reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Lymphoma Registry. This has been examined to establish the incidence of secondary leukaemia and myelodysplasia and to relate this to possible prognostic factors. 131 centres representing 4998 patients responded to a questionnaire. This identified 66 patients with post transplant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The actuarial risk for MDS/AML at 5 years post-transplant (+/-95% CI) was 4.6% (3.1-6.8) for Hodgkin's disease and 3.0% (2.0-4. 3) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multivariate analysis for all patients demonstrated an effect of age at transplant, radiotherapy at conditioning, number of transplants and interval between diagnosis and transplant as risk factors. For patients with NHL, grade of histology was important (low grade > intermediate or high-grade); for Hodgkin's disease, female sex was identified as a risk factor. These findings suggest that the incidence of MDS/AML may not be greater following an autograft than after conventional chemotherapy.
