Nucleoli were studied in the proliferation as well as maturation granulopoietic compartment in patients suffering from refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by means of simple cytochemical procedures for the demonstration of nucleolar RNA and silver stained proteins of nucleolus organizer regions. Regardless of the procedure used for the nucleolar visualization, early stages of the granulopoietic compartment and particularly myeloblasts of RAEB patients were characterized by reduction of the nucleolar number expressed by the nucleolar coefficient the values of which resembled those described previously in acute myeloid leukemias. The reduced values of the nucleolar coefficient of these cells in silver stained specimens of RAEB patients were accompanied by a decreased number of clusters of silver stained particles representing interphasic silver stained nucleolus organizer regions (AgNORs). The reduction of these clusters was also described previously in leukemic cells. In addition, the differences in the values of the nucleolar coefficient of granulocytic precursors between specimens stained for RNA and those stained with the silver reaction might reflect changing composition and proportions of nucleolar components in the course of the granulocytic development.
