 OBJECTIVE: Thrombocytopenia is a significant and morbid problem in patients with hematologic malignancy, resulting in frequent platelet transfusions and significant resource consumption. We undertook this study to determine the impact of splenectomy on transfusion requirements in patients with chronic leukemia, acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoma. METHODS: Records of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent splenectomy were reviewed. Results are reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean. RESULTS: Mean preoperative (preop) platelet count was 97 +/- 8 K/microL. A significant rise in platelets, compared with preop, was observed starting on postsplenectomy day 1 (141 +/- 8 K/microL, P < 0.001 versus preop) and persisted through day 7. Counts remained significantly elevated at 3 and 6 months and years 1-5. In profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (preop levels < 20 K/microL), preop count was 11 +/- 1 K/microL. A significant postsplenectomy platelet rise persisted for at least 1 year (137 +/- 52 K/microL, P < 0.05 versus preop). An increased platelet level was observed in all hematologic subgroups; in the chronic leukemias (n = 58, P < 0.01) and in lymphoma (n = 59, P < 0.001), this reached significance. Mean platelet transfusions were significantly decreased from preop (3 months preop: 8.6 +/- 2 units) compared with postsplenectomy (3 months postsplenectomy: 5.0 +/- 1 unit, P = 0.03). This decrease was even more pronounced in profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (31.6 +/- 10.6 units preop versus 8.9 +/- 4.8 units postoperative, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the hematologic malignancies, splenectomy produces a significant and longlasting restoration of platelet levels and a resultant decrease in platelet transfusion requirements. These beneficial effects of splenectomy hold true even for the most profoundly thrombocytopenic patients.
