Translocations or deletions involving the 11q23 region have been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BAC probes encompassing the D11S29 and D11S924 markers and flanking the MLL gene were used in dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fifteen patients with hematologic malignancies and cytogenetic abnormalities of 11q23 were analyzed. The BAC and MLL probes demonstrated split signals in five of 7 ALL or AML cases with translocations of 11q23. Of the remaining 2 cases, one had normal signals for both probe sets and the other had a submicroscopic deletion of the MLL 3' region. In one case of AML with del(11)(q23), deletion of the MLL 3' region and the region telomeric to the MLL gene was seen. Three CLL cases with deletion of part or the entire 11q23 region showed deletion of one copy of MLL, but retention of the region telomeric to MLL. However, in four MDS cases with deletions involving the 11q23 region, deletions of both the MLL gene and the flanking regions of the MLL gene were observed. Hence, the deletions on 11q23 are different but overlapping for CLL and MDS, implicating different genes involved for these diseases.
