The arrangement of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes has been analysed in 72 cases of primary myelodysplastic syndrome and 17 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. DNA was extracted from bone marrow aspirates, digested with at least two restriction enzymes, and hybridised with probes for the joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, the constant region of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene, and the joining region of the T-cell receptor gamma chain gene. All cases showed germline arrangements of the immunoglobulin and the T cell receptor genes. Thus, true interlineage infidelity, myeloid to lymphoid, is a rare occurrence in myelodysplasia and in myeloid leukemias.
