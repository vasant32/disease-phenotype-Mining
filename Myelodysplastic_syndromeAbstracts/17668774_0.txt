Thrombocytopenia is present when the number of platelets drops to below 150 G/l. Leaving aside pseudothrombocytopenia, such a situation may be triggered by pregnancy or a range of different drugs, or may signify the presence of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Thrombocytosis is present when the platelet count exceeds 500 G/l. This condition includes a large variety of forms of reactive thrombocytosis, a clonal increase in thrombocytes in hematological diseases, and the rare condition of familial thrombocytosis.
