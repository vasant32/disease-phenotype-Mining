We have applied an automated real-time quantitative PCR assay using a double-labeled fluorogenic probe to detect t(9;22)-positive cells in haematological malignancies. The results are expressed as the ratio of chimeric bcr-abl transcripts on abl transcripts. Highly reproducible results were obtained for t(9;22)-positive K562 RNA. Ten copies of bcr-abl DNA from a recombinant KW-3 plasmid and one positive cell in 10(4) can be detected. Thirty-two patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 25 with acute leukaemia, 12 with myelodysplastic syndromes and 7 with other myeloproliferative syndromes were tested. Follow-up data were obtained in bcr-abl positive cases. Results were compared with those of conventional nested RT-PCR and cytogenetics. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR values correlated well with both these methods. However, in some cases the only means of detecting early relapse or blastic transformation was to examine the kinetics of real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Thus, real-time quantitative RT-PCR appears suitable for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with the t(9;22) translocation.
