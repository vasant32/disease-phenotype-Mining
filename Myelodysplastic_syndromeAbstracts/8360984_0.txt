The primary objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with antibacterial and antifungal drugs for patients with hematological disorders complicated with infections of unknown causative organisms. The subjects consisted of 55 patients with hematological disorders, 28 males and 27 females, ranging from 1 to 78 years of age, with an average age of 34 years. The breakdown of the patients by disease was: 41 leukemias, 10 malignant lymphomas, 3 myelodysplastic syndromes and an aplastic anemia. All patients were treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) and aminoglycoside (AG) plus fluconazole (FLCZ) as an empiric therapy. Overall efficacy rate was 54.5% for all the patients: 57.7% for patients with suspected sepsis and 0% for those with pneumonia from which unknown organisms were detected. The efficacy rate was 59.4% for patient who had been previously treated with other antibiotics and 47.8% for those who had not previously been treated. The above results suggested that this combination therapy might be effective for severe infections of unknown causative organisms associated with hematological disorders.
