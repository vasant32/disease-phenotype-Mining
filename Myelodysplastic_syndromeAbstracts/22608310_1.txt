We retrospectively assessed morphologic and cytogenetic responses to 5-azacytidine and decitabine in a cohort of 42 adult therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (tMDS) patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and in 2 industry-sponsored decitabine trials (D0007 and DACO-020). The overall response rate (complete remission+marrow CR+hematologic improvement) was 38%, including 6 patients with complete remission (14%), 6 with marrow CR with or without hematologic improvement (14%), and 4 with hematologic improvement alone (10%). We conclude that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors showed activity in tMDS that is roughly comparable to that seen in de novo MDS.
