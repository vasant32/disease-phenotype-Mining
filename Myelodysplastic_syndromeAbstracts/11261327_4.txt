There is increasing evidence that the acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML-1) gene plays a versatile role in hematopoiesis, and its inactivation has been described in various hematopoetic disorders, e.g., leukemia or familial thrombocytopenia. AML-1 can be affected by various mechanisms, such as chromosomal translocations or point mutations. On the other hand, the specific underlying molecular lesions in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukemias with aberrations of chromosomes 5q or 7, respectively, are largely unknown. Despite extraordinary scientific effort no specific genes on chromosome 5q or 7, which act as tumor suppressors, have definitely been identified. Therefore, it has recently been speculated that the AML-1 gene, even if distantly located on chromosome 21q22, may be involved in leukemogenesis in patients with aberrations at chromosome 5q or monosomy 7 [2]. Therefore, we sequenced all exons of the AML-1 gene in 15 patients with MDS/AML and deleted chromosome 5q or 7q, respectively. None of the patients analyzed had any AML-1 mutation.
