Up-regulation of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) on haematopoietic progenitors and Fas-mediated apoptosis have been suggested to occur in a possible pathological mechanism in some bone marrow failure syndromes. We examined the expression of Fas antigen and susceptibility to Fas-mediated suppression of donor-derived haematopoietic cells of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients. Cytofluorometric analysis revealed low expression of Fas on CD34+ bone marrow cells from marrow donors or healthy controls. However, significantly higher expression of Fas antigen was observed on CD34+ bone marrow cells of BMT recipients, in whom engraftment of donor bone marrow (BM) cells was confirmed. The addition of an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (Ab) (CH-11) to haematopoietic stem cell culture of BM cells more strongly suppressed colony formation from granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) after BMT. Pretreatment by blocking anti-Fas Ab (ZB4) abrogated the Fas-mediated GM-CFU and BFU-E suppression. Purified marrow CD34+ cells from BMT recipients were also susceptible to the Fas-mediated colony suppression. Thus, donor-derived CD34+ haematopoietic cells increased their expression of Fas antigen and were susceptible to Fas-mediated haematopoietic suppression. These findings provide new insight for understanding the haematological condition after BMT.
