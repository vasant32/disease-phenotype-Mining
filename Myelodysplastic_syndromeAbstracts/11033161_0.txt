Background: Recently, the incidence of tuberculosis in compromised hosts has increased.Case: A 52-year-old man suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) had pulmonary tuberculosis. On June 22, 1996, we found a disc-sized choroidal lesion with milky appearance on the paramacular in his right eye. After 1 month, a similar choroidal lesion was found near the disc in the same eye. In spite of chemotherapy for MDS and antituberculosis medications, those choroidal lesions gradually enlarged. In November, satellite lesions were found around them. Some retinal exudates and hemorrhage were also detected in both eyes. He died on April 6, 1997. We found Langhan's giant cells in the choroid on the specimen of his eyes. So we judged the choroidal lesions to be tuberculous uveitis.Conclusion: This case showed choroidal tuberculosis and choroidal miliary tuberculosis in the same eye that were resistant to medications. We thought resistance to medication was due to destruction of the immune system by MDS.
