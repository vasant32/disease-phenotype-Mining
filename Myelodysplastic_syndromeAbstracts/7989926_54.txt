PURPOSE: To analyze the risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) following autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or peripheral stem-cell transplantation (PSCT) and to determine the impact on failure-free survival (FFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent ABMT or PSCT for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. For those patients who went on to develop MDS/AML, controls were selected and a case-control-within-a-cohort study undertaken. RESULTS: Twelve patients developed MDS or AML a median of 44 months following ABMT/PSCT. The cumulative incidence (P = .42) and the conditional probability (P = .32) of MDS/AML were not statistically different between HD and NHL patients. Age greater than 40 years at the time of transplant (P = .05) and receipt of a total-body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen (P = .06) were predictive for developing MDS/AML in patients with NHL. CONCLUSION: There is an increased risk of MDS/AML following ABMT/PSCT for lymphoid malignancies. NHL patients age > or = 40 years at the time of transplant and who received TBI are at greatest risk.
