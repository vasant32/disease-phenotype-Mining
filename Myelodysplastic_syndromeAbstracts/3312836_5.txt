Southern blot analyses demonstrated hemizygosity of c-fms sequences in three cases of the 5q- syndrome, cytogenetically characterized by del(5)(q13;q35) or del(5)(q31;q35). In situ hybridization studies revealed a deletion of this oncogene from the 5q- chromosome in two cases; moreover, we localized c-fms to region 5q31-33.
