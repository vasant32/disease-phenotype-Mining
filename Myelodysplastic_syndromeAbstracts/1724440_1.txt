High levels of HbF were found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as a possible switching of the ratio of the gamma chains from the adult to the newborn type in 25% of our patients. These abnormalities in general were not present in the parents. The possibility of having thalassemia or other hemoglobinopathies was excluded. The fetal hemoglobin percentage was quantitated by alkali denaturation of the hemolysate, and the gamma chain content was determined in blood hemolysate by HPLC following HbF isolation. A 7/3 ratio of fetal Gy/Ay was found in three patients. Since the survival of MDS patients with high HbF levels was longer than that of patients with low levels of HbF, this finding may be used as a potential prognostic factor.
