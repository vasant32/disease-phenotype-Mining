A 72-year-old man originally seen for anemia and thrombocytopenia was determined to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bone marrow examination at the time of CLL diagnosis revealed a small but significant population of atypical blasts. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirate disclosed chromosomal abnormalities (-7, +8) suggestive of a myelodysplastic syndrome. Shortly after treatment of the CLL, there was proliferation of the previously noted blast population, which cytochemical studies demonstrated to be of the myeloid series thus indicating acute myeloid leukemia superimposed on CLL. This report presents microscopic, cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and cytochemical evidence to document the evolution of acute myeloid leukemia in the bone marrow of a patient with CLL after one course of chemotherapy.
