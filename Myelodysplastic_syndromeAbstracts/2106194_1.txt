Platelet membrane glycoproteins were analyzed in a case of myelodysplastic syndrome with inv(3) (q21q26) presenting with prominent dysmegakaryopoiesis by three different labelling techniques for surface proteins. Markedly decreased level of platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb was observed in the patient's platelets by terminal sialic acid labelling method, whereas no significant changes in the levels of glycoproteins including GPIIb could be detected either by penultimate galactose labelling or by tyrosine/histidine labelling. These results indicate a decreased sialylation of GPIIb in the patient's platelets, implying aberrant process in thrombopoiesis in the disease.
