Wilms' tumor gene WT1 mRNA is a new marker of leukemic blast cells for AML, ALL, and CML. The minimal residual disease(MRD) of leukemia can be detected at frequencies as low as 1 in 10(3) to 10(4) normal bone marrow cells and 1 in 10(5) normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells by means of the quantitation of WT1 mRNA (WT1 assay) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Thus, the WT1 assay makes it possible to rapidly assess the effectiveness of treatment and to evaluate the degree of eradication of leukemic cells in individual leukemia patients. Furthermore, the WT1 assay can continuously assess the disease progression of myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) and predict the evolution of MDS to overt AML within 6 months. Moreover, WT1 protein is highly immunogenic, thus, WT1 peptide-based cancer immunotherapy is effective.
