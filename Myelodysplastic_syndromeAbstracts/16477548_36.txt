 BACKGROUND: Micafungin is a newly approved antifungal agent in the echinocandin class that is active against Candida species and Aspergillus species. However, this agent has limited activity against a number of fungi, including Trichosporon species. We describe 4 patients who developed disseminated trichosporonosis during the use of micafungin. No cases of trichosporonosis had been seen in the 2 years prior to January 2003, when micafungin became available in our hospital. METHODS: We reviewed microbiological records of patients at Kameda General Hospital (Kamogawa City, Chiba, Japan) from 1 January 2002 to 31 July 2005, and identified 4 patients whose blood culture results were positive for Trichosporon species. RESULTS: Since January 2003, four patients--3 with acute myelocytic leukemia and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome--developed disseminated trichosporonosis while receiving treatment with micafungin with or without amphotericin B. The initial 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon beigelii, and the later 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon asahii. All 4 patients received micafungin, and 2 also received amphotericin B concomitantly. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of micafungin were >16 microg/mL for the 2 isolates available for susceptibility testing. One patient with hematologic recovery (neutrophils >500 cells/mm3) showed elimination of the fungus after receiving treatment with voriconazole. However, the 3 other patients without hematologic or immunological recovery died of disseminated infection. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of trichosporonosis in our hospital and its emergence after the introduction of micafungin therapy support the idea that micafungin may exert a significant, selective pressure toward resistant fungi, such as Trichosporon species. Therefore, care should be taken regarding the possibility of trichosporonosis in patients receiving micafungin with or without amphotericin B.
