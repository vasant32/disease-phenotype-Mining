The study was aimed to compare the effects of T-cell suppression mediated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from normal individuals and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. MSC were cultured from the bone marrow of 12 healthy volunteers and 12 MDS patients, the morphology, surface markers and expression of several cytokines of MSC from normal individuals and MDS patients were compared, and the effects of T-cell suppression were tested in the following assays: phytohemaglutinin (PHA)-primed cultures, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), cell cycle of T-cell after PHA-primed cultures and apoptosis of T-cell as well. The results showed that the MSC from normal individuals and MDS patients were similar in morphology, proliferation and surface markers. The suppressions of T-cell proliferation induced by PHA and alloantigens mediated by MDS-MSC were significantly lower than that of normal MSC. More T-cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase by normal MSC, while the effects were deficient by MDS-MSC. The suppression of T-cell activation mediated by MDS-MSC was also lower than that of normal MSC, but suppression effect on T-cell apoptosis increased. The cytokines TGF-beta1, 3, FasL expressed by MDS-MSC were reduced as compared with normal MSC, but TGF-beta2 expression increased in MDS-MSC. It is concluded that although the morphology, proliferation and cell surface markers of MDS-MSC are normal, the T-cell suppression mediated by MDS-MSC is deficient as compared with normal controls. Whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia remains to be determined.
