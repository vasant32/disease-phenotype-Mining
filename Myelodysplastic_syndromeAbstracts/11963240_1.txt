PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to measure microcirculation parameters by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (d-MRI) and to evaluate the anti-angiogentic effects during treatment with thalidomide in different hematologic malignancies. METHODS: In 20 healthy normal persons, 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 10 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 10 with myelofibrosis (MF) a fast gradient echo sequence (Turbo fast low angle shot 2D) with a pump controlled bolus infusion of gadolinium-DTPA was performed before and in 18 of these after beginning (average of 4.3 months) of a thalidomide therapy. Two pharmacokinetic parameters--the amplitude and exchange-rate-constant--were calculated and a statistical comparison of these values between healthy persons and patients as well as a correlation with the clinical course was executed. RESULTS: Compared with the normal controls the patients showed a higher amplitude (normal persons 14.4 +/- 5.2, MDS 24.8 +/- 8.1, MF 35.9 +/- 4.3, MM 23.4 +/- 3.6) and exchange-rate-constant (normal persons 0.124 +/- 0.042, MDS 0.136 +/- 0.036, MF 0.144 +/- 0.068, MM 0.131 +/- 0.034). In the d-MRI-follow-up examinations a significant (p < 0.005) reduction of the amplitude and exchange rate constant values was evident in 14 of 18 patients undergoing a thalidomide therapy. Clinically all of these patients showed a therapy responding with complete or partial diseases remission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematologic malignancies significantly higher d-MRI-microcirculation parameters of the lumbar spine can be demonstrated than in normal persons. During anti-angiogenetic treatment with thalidomide a decrease of these values was observed in case of a responding to therapy.
