Ratios of young platelets or reticulated platelets can be routinely obtained as an immature platelet fraction (IPF) with the XE-2100 automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We combined IPF analysis of 31 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a complete blood count, a bone marrow examination, and a chromosome analysis. The patients with >40 x 10(9)/L platelets were classified as group A, and those with > or =40 x 10(9)/L were placed in group B. The 2 groups were subclassified as A1 or B1 for patients with an IPF of <10% and as A2 or B2 for those with an IPF > or =10%. Categories A1, A2, B1, and B2 comprised 12 patients, 6 patients, 7 patients, and 6 patients, respectively. Patients with a relatively high IPF (>10%) (category A2 or B2) showed distinctive characteristics. Group B2 showed a higher frequency of chromosomal abnormalities than B1 (P = .029), and group A2 tended to show a higher incidence of clinical improvement than A1 (P = .08). IPF determination may be clinically useful for the assessment of prognosis for MDS patients.
