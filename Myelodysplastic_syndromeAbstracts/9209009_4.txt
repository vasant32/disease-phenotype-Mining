Eighteen patients aged 60-84 years with acute myeloid leukemia were treated with low-dose combination chemotherapy comprising cytarabine, etoposide, and mitozantrone or 6-thioguanine; seven of these patients had a pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome. Nine patients achieved a complete remission, and five had a partial remission. The duration of survival in these 14 responding patients has ranged from 2+ to 19+ months. Myelotoxicity occurred regularly, with time to recovery (neutrophils > or =0.5 x 10(9)/L, platelets > or =50 x 10(9)/L) from nadir being 10-14 days in 12 of the 14 patients. This novel approach with an overall response rate of 78% appears to be a simple and effective form of therapy for elderly patients.
