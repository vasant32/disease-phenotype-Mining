Post-transfusion hemochromatosis is a major concern in patients with chronic transfusion (i.e. more than 20 red blood cell concentrates). While the monitoring of infectious complications and transfusion accidents is clearly one of the missions of haemovigilance, hemochromatosis is not yet subject to such a systematic monitoring. We therefore wanted to assess the incidence of this complication in the context of a general hospital (hospital of Aix) and propose the establishment of a screening and a comprehensive monitoring of post transfusion hemochromatosis.
