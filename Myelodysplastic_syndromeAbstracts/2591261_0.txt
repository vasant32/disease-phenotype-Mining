Systematic clinical and laboratory observations of 64 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were made. The results showed that malignant clone already exists in the bone marrow of patients with MDS. Eighteen cases of them have transformed into AML. The rates of transforming into AML in RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML were markedly higher than that in RA. The courses of MDS which transformed into AML from the various types were different. The transformation in RA was obviously longer than those in RAEB and RAEB-T. Two cases transformed into myelofibrosis. Diagnosis of CMML according to the FAB classification criteria revealed that it has two forms. One shows only increase of mature monocytes and it has no relation with the types of acute leukemia to be transformed. It is considered as a reactive monocytosis. The other form, in addition to increase of mature monocytes, also has increase of a few monoblasts and promonocytes. These are considered as true CMML and usually quickly developed into M4 or M5 which are related with monocytes.
