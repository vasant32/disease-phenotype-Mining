Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20, as the sole abnormality, is commonly observed in myeloid malignancies, including myeloproliferative disorder, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. The breakpoints of the deletion are typically located in the region 20q11.2 approximately q13.3, although smaller deletions within this region have also been reported. We present here 4 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with an isochromosome of the deleted long arm of chromosome 20: ider(20)(q10)del(20)(q11q13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed on the bone marrow samples from these patients to prove the identity of this unusual chromosome abnormality.
