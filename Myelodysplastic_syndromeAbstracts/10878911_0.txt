The proliferative activity of bone marrow cells was studied by flow cytofluorometry in 8 patients with aplastic anemia (AA), 6 with myelodyspastic syndrome (MDS), and 26 normal subjects aged 21-40 years. The myelokaryocyte proliferation was inhibited at the G0-1 stages of cell cycle, the number of cells in the S phase was decreased, and the coefficient of variations cV of DNA cytofluorometry values were increased in AA patients in comparison with the norm. By contrast, in MDS patients the number of cells in the G0-1 phase was decreased and that of cells in the S phase increased in comparison with the norm and with AA patients; cV was increased. These differences in the cell cycle characteristics are suggested to be used as a differential diagnostic criterion in AA and MDS.
