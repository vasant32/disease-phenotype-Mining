 PURPOSE: This was a retrospective analysis of outcome based on cytogenetics for a Children's Cancer Group phase 3 trial of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (CCG-2891). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of outcome for newly diagnosed children with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed using data collected from CCG-2891. The authors identified 11 patients whose blasts carried t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q among 470 eligible patients entered with acceptable, centrally reviewed cytogenetics. A bone marrow specimen was used for each case of cytogenetic analysis in which 20 banded (either G-banded or Q-banded) metaphases were completed on each subject. All 11 patients had characteristic monocytoid morphology (M4 or M5) and tended to be young (0.1-7.9 years; median 0.9 years). RESULTS: All 11 patients entered remission, but remissions tended to be short; 9 patients relapsed within 12 months (median 4 months). The relapse rate of 82% was significantly higher for this group of patients compared with 46% for the group at large. The relapse rate for this group of patients having t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was also significantly higher compared with subjects with other 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities. The CNS relapse rate of 55% was higher for this group of patients compared with 3% for all other patients in the study. The CNS relapse rate was higher for the subjects who had t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q compared with subjects with all other chromosome 11 abnormalities. Three children survived, two in second remissions (4.7 and 6.3 years after relapse) and one in first remission (7.0 years after diagnosis). Survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from all other patients with cytogenetics. Similarly, the survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) translocations and other rearrangements of chromosomes 10 and 11 was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from the 11q23 group of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to determine the various changes that are occurring at the molecular level for patients with t(10;11) translocations and other rearrangements of chromosomes 10 and 11 to gain insight into the mechanisms causing this clinical phenotype associated with a poor prognosis.
