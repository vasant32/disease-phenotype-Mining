The 2nd International Congress on Leukemia, Lymphoma and Myeloma (ICLLM) is a novel initiative of the Turkish Society of Hematology. The first congress was organized in Fethiye in May, 2007. After the success and positive impressions of the participants, the THD decided to organize the ICLLM every other year. The major focus was hematological malignancies, not only LLM, but also myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. The target audience was hematologists, oncologists and those involved in stem cell transplantation. The congress was held over 2 and a half days and attended by more than 350 participants from 25 different countries. The scientific program was shaped by 12 distinguished international speakers, who co-chaired and designed the sessions. The majority of the hematologists are caring for malignant patients and the Congress was a great opportunity for participants to get the latest update before the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology 2009 official meeting. The rising interest and encouraging increase in the number of participants geared us to announce the organization of 3rd ICLLM in May 2011 in Istanbul.
