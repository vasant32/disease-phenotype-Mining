A patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts, ringed sideroblasts, and thrombocytosis was found on cytogenetic analysis to have trisomy 19 as the sole abnormality. Although trisomy 19 in combination with other chromosomal anomalies has been encountered in association with a variety of hematologic malignancies, many solid tumors, and the myelodysplastic syndrome, its occurrence as the only cytogenetic aberration is rare and has not been reported in association with thrombocythemia.
