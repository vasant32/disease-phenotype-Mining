Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired bone-marrow disorders, characterized by a decreased ability of the haemopoietic cell to differentiate, resulting in peripheral cytopenias. The majority of patients will die either from acute myeloid leukaemia or from infection and/or haemorrhage. Thirty-eight courses of low dose Ara C were administered in 26 MDS patients. Nineteen courses (50%) were associated with good (12) or partial (7) response. Three complete remissions were observed. The median duration of response overall was 19.5 weeks, 26 weeks for the good and 10 weeks for the partial responders. A high incidence of treatment failure was seen in patients treated after transition to AML. Major complications were observed during 14 courses and mortality was directly related to therapy in five patients. Platelet transfusions were required during 26 courses. Aggravation of peripheral-blood cytopenia during the first weeks and hypocellularity of bone-marrow aspirates at the end of therapy suggest that low-dose Ara C exerts its main activity by suppression of leukaemic growth, rather than by induction of differentiation in malignant cells. Our results in MDS patients demonstrate that low-dose Ara C can be of value in severe cytopenia and can decrease the proportion of leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, but the danger of treatment should not be underestimated.
