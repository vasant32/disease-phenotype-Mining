Tetrasomy 8 as a sole anomaly in hematological disorders is relatively rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 19 such cases have been described in the literature to date. Of them, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 13 (M1, one; M2, three; M4, one; M5, eight), acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) in one, myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) in 3, polycythemia vera(PV) and myelofibrosis(MF), one case each. Their median survival was 20 weeks. Here, we report the first case of a 29-year-old man with minimally differentiated AML (AML-M0) displaying a tetrasomy 8 clone. Immunophenotyping showed positivity with CD33, CD34 and intracellular MPO, but all lymphoid markers tested were negative. Conventional cytogenetics of bone marrow cells showed 84.9% of metaphases with tetrasomy 8 in addition to 15.1% with normal diploidy. However, Fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) using a centromeric probe specific for chromosome 8 revealed trisomy 8 in 14.2% of interphase nuclei besides tetrasomy 8 in 82.4%. The patient died four weeks after diagnosis without therapy. In conclusion, these findings suggest that tetrasomy 8 is associated with a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders and heralds a bad prognosis. It may be a consequence of clonal evolution of trisomy 8.
