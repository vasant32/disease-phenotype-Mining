To explore therapeutic efficacy of androgens and low dose all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 55 patients of MDS were observed, including 41 cases of refractory anemia (RA), 11 cases of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 2 cases of refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and 1 case of chronic myeloic-monocytic leukemia (CMML). These patients received danazol (600 mg/day) or stanazol (6 mg/day) and ATRA (10 mg/day) for at least 3 months. The results showed that according to MDS international working group response criteria, at the end of three months,complete remission (CR) was seen in 1 patient, partial remission (PR) was found in 2 patients. Hematologic improvement: major response (MaR) were seen in 15 patients, minor response (MiR) were seen in 4 patients. The total response rate was 35.8%. In conclusion, danazol or stanazol in combination with low dose ATRA are partialy effective in therapy for patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
