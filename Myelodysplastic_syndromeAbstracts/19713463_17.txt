The prognostic heterogeneity of the World Health Organization category of "systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematologic nonmast cell lineage disease" (SM-AHNMD) has not been systematically validated by primary data. Among 138 consecutive cases with SM-AHNMD, 123 (89%) had associated myeloid neoplasm: 55 (45%) myeloproliferative neoplasm (SM-MPN), 36 (29%) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 28 (23%) myelodysplastic syndrome (SM-MDS), and 4 (3%) acute leukemia. Of the myeloid subgroups, SM-MPN displayed a 2- to 3-fold better life expectancy (P = .003), whereas leukemic transformation was more frequent in SM-MDS (29%; P = .02). The presence of eosinophilia, although prevalent (34%), was prognostically neutral, and the overall results were not affected by exclusion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive cases. We conclude that it is clinically more useful to consider specific entities, such as SM-MPN, systemic mastocytosis with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, SM-MDS, and systemic mastocytosis with-acute leukemia, rather than their broad reference as SM-AHNMD.
