The ETV6/GOT1 fusion, resulting from t(10;12) (q24;p13), has been recently described in a myelodysplastic syndrome. We reported a second case of t(10;12)-positive myelodysplastic syndrome in whom fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed the non-random translocation but molecular biology analyses revealed a ETV6/GOT1 chimera varying from the first case described.
