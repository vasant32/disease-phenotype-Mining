Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 [del(5q)] or loss of a whole chromosome 5 (-5) is a common finding, arising de novo in 10% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in 40% of patients with therapy-related MDS or AML. We investigated by molecular cytogenetics 23 MDS/AML patients for whom conventional cytogenetics detected a monosomy 5. Monosomy 5 was redefined as unbalanced or balanced translocation and ring of chromosome 5. Loss of 5q material was identified in all 23 patients, but one. One copy of EGR1(5q31) or CSF1R(5q33-34) genes was lost in 22 of the 23 patients. Chromosome 5p material was a constant chromosomal component of derivative chromosomes or rings in all patients, but one. Sequential fluorescent in situ hybridization studies with whole chromosome paints and region-specific probes, used as a complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis, allow a better interpretation of karyotypes in MDS/AML patients.
