OBJECTIVE: To study on allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with unrelated donor or sibling donor for myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation patients. METHODS: Two male patients received chemotherapy regimen of busulfan-cyclophosphamide before allogeneic BMT. Mycophenolate mofetil combined with cyclosporin A and methotrexate was used for prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Low dose heparin and lipo prostaglandin E1 were used in prophylactic regimen for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. RESULTS: Neutrophil count began to be higher than 0.5 x 10(9)/L on 21st and 17th days after BMT in the two patients. Disease-free survival in the two patients was 10 months and 3.5 months respectively. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with unrelated or sibling donor is an effective therapy for patients with MDS.
