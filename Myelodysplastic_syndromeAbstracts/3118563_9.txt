The clinical and haematological findings in 18 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were correlated with the histological features of plastic embedded bone marrow biopsies. Fifteen patients presented with peripheral cytopaenia of one or several cell lines. Twelve (66%) of the 18 patients exhibited bone marrow findings including normo- to hypercellularity, myelodysplasia, lymphocytosis with or without plasmacytosis and fibrosis of the reticulin type. Seventeen patients had myelodysplastic features, 5 of the 3 haematopoietic lines, 10 of 2 lines and 2 of 1 line. Dysmegakaryocytopoiesis and dyserythropoiesis, seen in 88% and 83% of the 18 patients respectively, were the most common myelodysplastic features. Bone marrow gelatinous transformation (serous atrophy) was a conspicuous finding in 7 (38%) of the 18 patients. The constellation of histological features here described, although not pathognomonic, is highly suggestive of HIV infection. The pathogenesis of the haematological abnormalities in HIV infection is discussed.
