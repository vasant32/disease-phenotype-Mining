Cutaneous T cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome, and primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferations constitute less than 10% of all cutaneous T cell lymphomas. Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T cell lymphoma is a member of this third group of cutaneous lymphomas, separated out as provisional entity in the World Health Organization classification - European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) classification. It still awaits development of more precise diagnostic criteria and optimal therapy. We report a case of primary cutaneous CD4 + small/medium-sized pleomorphic T cell lymphoma accompanied with myelodysplastic syndrome successfully treated with cyclophosphamide. It seems that cyclophosphamide as a single-agent chemotherapy in patients with disseminated lesions might be safe and quite effective therapeutic option.
