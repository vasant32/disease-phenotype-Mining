Various morphological dysplastic changes were observed in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, especially in the acute crisis. To clarify their significance, we divided 45 patients in the acute crisis into two groups by our scoring system, the dysplastic group and the non-dysplastic group. Five of 25 subjects in the non-dysplastic group entered complete remission. None of 20 subjects in the dysplastic group did so, and the mean survival after the onset of acute crisis is significantly shorter in the dysplastic group than in the non-dysplastic group. Some patients in the dysplastic group had obvious dysplastic changes several months before the acute crisis. These findings suggest that acute crises in some cases may occur with or be preceded by the development of dysplastic clones similar to myelodysplastic syndrome; these patients respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy.
