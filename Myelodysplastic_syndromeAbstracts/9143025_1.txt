Identification of megakaryocytes by immunohistochemistry may be superior to hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain method for assessing megakaryocyte size and number in clinical specimens; however, a side-by-side comparison of the two methods has not been reported. In the present study, comparative morphometry using both methods was performed on marrow biopsies of normal individuals, and of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia. Morphometric results in the present study showed that precise megakaryocyte size can be calculated in normal and pathologic bone marrow sections by using HE stain if one employs stereological corrections. In contrast, megakaryocyte numbers can be more precisely detected by immunohistochemistry than by HE stain, particularly in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myeloid leukemia. Differentiation disturbances and ineffective megakaryocytopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome were demonstrated by immunomorphometric analyses.
