Interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q is a common cytogenetic abnormality observed in MDS. We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine accurately the percentage of cytogenetically abnormal peripheral blood cells. YAC and cosmid probes localized to chromosome 5q were hybridized to interphase nuclei from purified polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from six MDS patients with chromosome 5 deletions. Per patient, 25-67% of the cells exhibited one signal for the 5q31-q33 specific probes IL-4, D5S207 and c-fms. This percentage was constant for the various probes utilized for each patient. Hybridization of the same probes to PMNs from healthy individuals and hybridization of probes (D5S39 and D5S498) localized outside the deleted segments to PMNs of the patients, resulted in 90-95% nuclei with two signals. In addition, FACS-purified peripheral blood cells were investigated by FISH using the IL-4 cosmid. This demonstrated that the hybridization pattern in monocytes was similar to that observed in PMNs, whereas T-lymphocytes showed no loss of signals. These results indicate that a subfraction of the myeloid progenitor cells have acquired the 5q deletion.
