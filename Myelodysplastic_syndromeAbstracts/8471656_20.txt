The present study, based upon the retrospective evaluation of 352 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (pMDS), revealed hypoplastic MDS in 42 patients (11.9%). Median age is similar in hypo- and normo-/hypercellular MDS (72.6 versus 70.7 versus 72.4 years). Hypoplastic MDS occurred significantly more often in women compared with normo- and hypercellular MDS. Sequential biopsies were performed in 14 patients, showing a persistence of hypoplasia over a period of up to 43 months. The proportion of patients showing mesenchymal reaction, especially an increase of mast cells, was significantly higher in hypoplastic MDS, whereas dysplastic features of hematopoiesis occurred less frequently and were of lower grade in comparison to normo-/hyperplastic MDS. Among the subgroup with hypoplastic bone marrow, the classification according to FAB criteria revealed 28 patients with RA (66.7%), three with RARS (7.1%), and eight with RAEB (19.0%), as well as one patient each with RAEB-T and CMMol (2.4% each), and one case which had to be reckoned among the category of unclassifiable MDS (2.4%). Median survival was 21.8 months for hypoplastic MDS, 26.9 months for normoplastic MDS, and 14.2 months for hyperplastic MDS. During follow-up, 14 patients (33%) with hypoplastic MDS developed acute nonlymphatic leukemia. Although not a constant finding, karyotype abnormalities involving particularly chromosome 7 seem to be associated with hypoplastic MDS. The results confirm the existence of a hypoplastic variant of MDS which seems to more frequently affect female patients, and which requires bone marrow biopsy for its accurate diagnosis.
