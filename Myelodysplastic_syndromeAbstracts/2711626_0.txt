The concurrent occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome and diabetes insipidus is very rare. In the available literature so far only three cases were described. In acute leukaemia the concurrence of the two diseases is rare. The authors describe two cases of concurrent diabetes insipidus and myelodysplastic syndrome with typical clinical and laboratory symptoms. A 27-year-old man with refractory anaemia (according to the FAB classification of myelodysplastic syndrome) died after 10 months from complications of acute leukaemia. In a 58-year-old female patients with refractory anaemia after two years remission the condition deteriorated and developed into RASEB (refractory anaemia with excess of blast cells) according to the FAB classification with partial remission of the disease after cytostatic treatment. During permanent substitution treatment (Adiuretin Spofa) diabetes insipidus was compensated in both diseases.
