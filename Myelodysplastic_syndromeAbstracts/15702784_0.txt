 OBJECTIVE: To observe the change of angiogenesis in the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and to explore its effect on this disease. METHODS: The sera of 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 20 normal controls were collected; the level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (S-VEGF) was measured by ELISA; and the microvessel density (MVD) of marrow biopsy specimens was examined with the streptavidine-biovatidine immunoperoxidase method; the count of MVD was evaluated with image analysis system. RESULTS: The level of S-VEGF and count of MVD were higher than that of normal control, and both significantly elevated in MDS/MPD and RAEB-t subtypes. The S-VEGF was positively related with MVD (P<0.05), and S-VEGF and MVD were closely related with the percentage of blast in marrow and in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The result shows that there is abnormal angiogenesis in MDS bone marrow, and the elevated levels of S-VEGF and MVD are closely related with a progressive status in myelodysplastic syndromes.
