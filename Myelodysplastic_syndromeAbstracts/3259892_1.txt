Between June 1978 and August 1985 12 patients with gold-induced aplastic anaemia were treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Median age was 38.5 years for the 11 females and one male. Treatment regimens varied, but all patients received 150-160 mg/kg horse anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG) over 4-10 d. Five patients had complete recovery of peripheral counts and one patient had a partial response. Of the six nonresponders one had a spontaneous recovery a year later and five died 6-67 d after beginning treatment. Seven patients are alive 4.3-8.9 years later. Six patients remain haematologically stable and one patient has developed a myelodysplastic syndrome. This experience confirms earlier reports of patients recovering marrow function after receiving immunosuppressive therapy for gold-related aplasia.
