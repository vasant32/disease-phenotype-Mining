A 10-year-old, female shih tzu was diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) based on the presence of a nonregenerative anemia, dysplastic changes in the three hematopoietic cell lines, a normal to hypercellular bone marrow, and less than 30% blast cells of all nucleated cells in the bone marrow. Low-dose aclarubicin, a differentiation-induction therapy for MDS and atypical leukemias in humans, was administered. Hematological improvement was observed, and the dog lived for 809 days after the first presentation.
