Using cDNA microarray assays we have observed a clear difference in the gene expression pattern between bone marrow stromal cells obtained from healthy children (CT) and from pediatric patients with either myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with MDS (MDS-AML). The global gene function profiling analysis indicated that in the pediatric MDS microenvironment the disease stages may be characterized mainly by underexpression of genes associated with biological processes such as transport. Furthermore, a subset of downregulated genes related to endocytosis and protein secretion was able to discriminate MDS from MDS-AML.
