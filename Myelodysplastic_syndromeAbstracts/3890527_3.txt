A report of four cases of severe myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) culminating in death in cadaver renal recipients is presented. All patients received predominantly antimetabolite immunosuppressive therapy. Abnormal cytogenetics were found in two cases. Survival was brief in all cases from the time of diagnosis. These cases add to the increasing number of patients treated with antimetabolite drugs for nonmalignant conditions who develop severe hematological abnormalities which might be a prodrome of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
