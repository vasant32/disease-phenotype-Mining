 BACKGROUND: Neutrophilic disease is characterized by aseptic visceral infiltration by normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can occur in any organ. Association with an underlying systemic disease, particularly haematological malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease, is frequent. This may produce a multisystem disorder, but diagnosis is usually based on skin lesions because of their clinical and histological accessibility. Pulmonary manifestations are the most common extracutaneous symptoms but may be misdiagnosed, as in our case report. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old woman with IgA myeloma presented with an inflammatory bullous plaque of the leg coupled with fever lasting one week. The clinical and histological examinations were evocative of a neutrophilic dermatosis such as Sweet's syndrome. Significant improvement was initially obtained with systemic corticosteroids and colchicine. The course became complicated by necrotic neutrophilic papulopustular lesions of the upper limbs and pulmonary manifestations, with fever and decline in overall condition occurring the day after administration of erythropoietin. A hypothesis of septic aetiology prompted antibiotic and antifungal therapy, which remained ineffective. The patient died the day after the second erythropoietin injection. DISCUSSION: This case involved late identification of the aseptic neutrophilic aetiology of pulmonary manifestations. Several factors favouring their appearance and the fatal outcome may be suggested: the existence of a myeloma, association with myelodysplastic syndrome and the possible iatrogenic action of erythropoietin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extracutaneous neutrophilic infiltrate occurring in a patient treated with this haematopoietic hormone.
