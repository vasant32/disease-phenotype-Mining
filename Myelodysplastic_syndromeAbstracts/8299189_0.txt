The authors describe the case-history of a boy with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) which developed into acute leukaemia. The latter was quite resistant to treatment. The disease was preceded by treatment of NH lymphoma with a high grade of malignity by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The authors give the total doses of all cytostatics which were administered to the patient. One year prior to diagnosis of MDS cytogenetic examination of peripheral blood revealed a highly pathological karyotype, from the numerical and structural aspect. Among others monosomy of chromosome no. 5 was found which is typical for MDS and these changes indicate as a rule a poor prognosis and relatively early transformation to acute leukaemia.
