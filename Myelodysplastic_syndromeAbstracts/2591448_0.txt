Cytosine-arabinoside (ARA-C) in low doses induces complete remissions in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia. Evidence is accumulating that these remissions are not reached by differentiation induction but through cytotoxicity. In HL60 cells differentiation was measured by a comprehensive panel of quantitative and qualitative markers of maturation. After exposure to ARA-C (10(-7) M) for 4 days HL60 cells did not mature morphologically. Cell volume increased. The increase in esterase activity was small and did not reach the amount measured in normal monocytes. There was no significant difference in latex phagocytosis and NBT reduction between cultures with and without ARA-C. HL60 cells were arrested in S-phase and clonogenic capacity persisted. The observed changes after exposure to ARA-C seem to be caused by impeded cell division while synthesis of protein continues. We conclude that ARA-C in low dose exerts its effect by halting proliferation through cytotoxic effects and not by differentiation induction.
