At 6 months of age, the patient was diagnosed as having neuroblastoma stage IV and was given the chemotherapy, local irradiation, and operation. The treatment was completed in September 1989. In 1992, at 6 years of age, her height was -3 SD and growth hormone secretion was depressed. She had been supplemented with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). Because the white blood cell counts began to decrease gradually in 1993, the rhGH therapy was interrupted on January 19, 1994. The rhGH supplement was resumed after a 3-month interval because of the parent's desire. Pancytopenia soon became apparent. She was diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a refractory anemia with an excess of blasts in transformation with monosomy 7. The rhGH therapy was interrupted again, without any improvement of the MDS. In culture studies, neither rhGH nor insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulated proliferation of her bone marrow cells. These data suggested that the treatment with rhGH after the chemotherapy played some role in the promotion, but not acceleration, of the MDS.
