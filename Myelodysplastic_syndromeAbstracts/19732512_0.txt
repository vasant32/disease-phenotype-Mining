This case represents an ethical problem in dealing with patients with prolonged stay of treatment and poor prognosis for survival in the context of known under-capacity in intensive care units (ICUs) in Denmark. A young man, diagnosed with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and myelodysplastic syndrome, developed necrotizing fasciitis and died of sepsis after 42 days. The treatment options were exhausted and treatment was eventually limited to antibiotics and fluid therapy, which raises the question; should ICUs be used for palliative care?
