A 72-year-old man who had worked as a coal worker for 28 years and as a tunnel construction worker for 18 years was admitted because of fever, dyspnea, and appetite loss. Pneumoconiosis had been diagnosed when he was 64 years old and myelodysplastic syndrome at 71 years of age. After admission, the patient was treated with antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs but did not respond. Respiratory failure gradually worsened and he died. Autopsy specimens revealed that the cause of death was exacerbation of respiratory failure due to pulmonary proteinosis rather than pulmonary infection. This is a case of pulmonary proteinosis complicated with pneumoconiosis and myelodysplastic syndrome which, to our knowledge, is rare. We also considered the possibility that defective pulmonary macrophage function due to myelodysplastic syndrome and long-term silica inhalation played a part in the development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in this case.
