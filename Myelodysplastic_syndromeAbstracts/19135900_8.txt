 OBJECTIVE: Identification of genomic lesions in progenitor cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) could lead to the discovery of new disease-specific genes and may be of prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a genome-wide mapping of DNA from CD34+ cells of MDS patients with high-resolution 500K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and a concomitant integration with global gene expression analysis. Thirteen MDS patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Copy number and loss of heterozygosity analyses detected heterozygous deletions on chromosomes 2, 9, 13, 16, 17, and 20 ranging in size from 0.1 megabases (Mba) to 2.1 Mba. Additionally, numerous regions with significant uniparental disomy were detected. Integration of the genomic data with gene expression analysis showed that genes, which were downregulated at least 1.5-fold in regions of significant deletion and uniparental disomy were exclusively downregulated in those samples displaying the aberration. Genomics and gene expression data were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and variable number tandem repeat analysis. CONCLUSION: High-density genomic mapping of CD34+ bone marrow cells from patients with MDS identifies cryptic genetic lesions and offers new opportunities for the discovery of target genes in MDS by integration with gene expression analysis.
