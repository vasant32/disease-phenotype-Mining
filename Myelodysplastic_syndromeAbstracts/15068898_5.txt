Telomerase is the enzyme required for the addition of telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes and thus for chromosome stability. Most somatic human cells lack telomerase activity because they do not express the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. In contrast, in almost every neoplasia, cancer cells express hTERT and therefore prevent progressive telomere shortening during each cell division. Consecutively, cancer cells obtain the ability to divide without limits and overcome replicative senescence. Gene expression level of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT in normal and neoplastic haematopoiesis has not yet been described. Using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay, we analysed the level of hTERT expression in various haematologic stem cell disorders and normal bone marrow. We could demonstrate that hTERT is differentially expressed in various haematologic stem cell disorders with significant higher levels in refractory anemia (RA) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared to other haematopoietic stem cell disorders and non-neoplastic haematopoiesis which may be used as a prognostic indicator in these entities.
