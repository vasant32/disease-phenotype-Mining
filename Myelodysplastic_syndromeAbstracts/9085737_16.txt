We have investigated cytokine mRNA expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants to assess the cytokine network after transplantation. IL-4 mRNA expression decreased in five of five (100%) patients with > or = grade III (severe) acute GVHD and increased in 10 of 22 (45%) patients without severe GVHD. In contrast, IL-12 mRNA expression increased in two of two (100%) patients with severe GVHD, but increased in only six of 18 (33%) patients without severe GVHD. Furthermore, IL-10 and/or IL-13 mRNA expression increased in 19 of 22 (86%) patients without severe GVHD, but increased in only one of three (33%) patients with severe GVHD. In patients with allogeneic PBSCT who had severe acute GVHD, the cytokine mRNA expression in patients with allogeneic PBSCT, who had no severe GVHD, showed a similar pattern to that in patients with allogeneic BMT. IL-4 mRNA expression increased in three of five (60%) patients and IL-10 and/or IL-13 mRNA expression increased in five of five (100%) patients. In contrast, IL-12 mRNA expression increased in only one of three (33%) patients. Serum IL-4 concentration in allogeneic PBSCT patients in the early engraftment phase was relatively high, while serum IL-12 concentration was low. These findings suggest that severe GVHD may be related to the cytokine imbalance between type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and type 2 helper T (Th2) cells.
