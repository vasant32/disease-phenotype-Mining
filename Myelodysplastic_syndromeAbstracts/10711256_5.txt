A case of myelodysplastic syndrome is reported, in which the bone marrow contained many cells with the typical light microscopic morphology of Gaucher cells. In the absence of any evidence of inherited Gaucher's disease, these cells are considered to be pseudo-Gaucher cells, which have been described previously in association with other haematological diseases. This is the first report of their occurrence in myelodysplastic syndrome.
