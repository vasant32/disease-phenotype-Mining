To study the biological characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and their supportive capacity for hematopoiesis in vitro, MSCs from bone marrow samples of MDS patients were isolated, cultured and expanded. Morphology, immunophenotype, osteoblasts differentiative and proliferative property of MSC and colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) were measured and analyzed. Mononuclear cells (MNC) of cord blood were plated onto a feeder layer formed by MSC of MDS patient, cells count and CFU-GM production were observed. The results showed that the culture-expanded cells from MDS patients presented a typical fibroblast-like morphology. Cells were positive for SH2 (CD105), SH3 (CD73), Thy-1 (CD90), but negative for CD34 and CD45. After induction, these cells could differentiate into osteoblasts. Their proliferative capacity and CFU-F number were similar to those of MSC from healthy donors. The total cell count and CFU-GM yield in supernatants after culture for 2 weeks were significantly lower than those of control in hematopoiesis supportive experiments in vitro (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the biological characteristics of MSC from bone marrow of MDS patients are not different from those of MSC isolated from bone marrow of normal donors, however, their capacity of hematopoiesis support in vitro are significantly weaker.
