Although reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has been increasingly used in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to reduce transplant-related mortality, a high relapse rate in RIC remains an unresolved problem. Considering the additive antileukemic effect of low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), we evaluated the feasibility of combining RIC regimens with low-dose TBI in de novo MDS. The RIC regimen combined with low-dose TBI in this study consisted of fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)), intravenous busulfan (6.4 mg/kg), and TBI (400 cGy). Antithymocyte globulin was used to overcome HLA mismatching. A total of 31 subjects were recruited with a median age of 39 years (range 19-63). The patients received transplants from siblings (n = 20) or unrelated donors (n = 11). All patients rapidly achieved full-donor chimerism. At a median follow-up for survivors of 35 months (range 6.0-54.9), the 3-year overall survival, event-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, and relapse rates were 67.6, 63.2, 20.5 and 11.4%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of acute (grades II-IV) and chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease in patients who survived at least 100 days was 39.2 and 44.6%, respectively. These results suggest that an RIC combined with low-dose TBI may be a feasible therapeutic approach for treating de novo MDS.
