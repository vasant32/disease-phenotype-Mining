Twenty-one acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were enrolled and received oral induction therapy with cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC) and etoposide (EP). The median age was 69 years (range: 33-86). There were 11 patients with de novo AML and 10 AML cases that had evolved from myelodysplastic syndromes. Seventeen patients had abnormal karyotypes including eight complex abnormalities, various complications, and 7 of 21 had a poor performance status (PS) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 3-4. All patients completed induction therapy without severe adverse events. Seven achieved complete remission (CR), and two achieved partial remission (PR). Uni- and multivariate analyses demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the results of therapy (CR +/- PR) and overall survival. The plasma concentrations of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in some cases were higher than those previously reported, indicating the accumulation of ara-C with increasing numbers of days of SPAC administration. We conclude that this therapy is well tolerated and useful for refractory and elderly AML patients.
