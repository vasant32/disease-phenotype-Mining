Wilms tumor gene (WT1) mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells was examined in 80 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MDS. Serum anti-WT1 antibody titers were also determined in 45 patients. Their long-term follow-up showed that the survival rate became worse as the WT1 mRNA level increased. In particular, a high WT1 mRNA level was a strong predictor of a short time to AML transformation even if adjusted by the International Prognostic Scoring System category. Moreover, high values of anti-WT1 antibody were an independent predictor of longer survival. These data may justify therapeutic strategies targeting WT1 molecules in MDS.
