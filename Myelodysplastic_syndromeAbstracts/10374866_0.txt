A 35-year-old female presented with isolated thrombocytopenia of autoimmune origin. One and a half years later, hypoplastic myelodysplastic (MDS) was diagnosed. Following treatment with cyclosporin A, erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, the patient has achieved a sustained hematological remission which is still ongoing after 3 years. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the third case described in the literature where treatment with cytokines alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents has resulted in a long standing cytogenetic response in MDS.
