Translocations and other rearrangements of the MLL gene at chromosome band 11q23 are biologically and clinically important molecular abnormalities in infant acute leukemias, leukemias associated with chemotherapeutic topoisomerase II poisons and, less often, acute leukemias in adults or myelodysplastic syndrome. Depending on the disease and the regimen, MLL-rearranged leukemias may be associated with inferior prognosis, and MLL rearrangements with some of the more than 60 known MLL-partner genes confer especially adverse effects as response to treatment (Blood 108:441-451, 2006). MLL rearrangements are usually evident as overt balanced chromosomal translocations by conventional cytogenetic analysis but up to one-third are cryptic rearrangements and occur in leukemias with del(11)(q23), a normal karyotype, or trisomy 11, the latter two of which sometimes are associated with partial tandem duplications of MLL itself (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:2814-2819, 2000; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:3899-3902, 1997). In addition, subsets of MLL rearrangements are complex at a cytogenetic level and/or molecular level, and fuse MLL with two different partner genes. Rapid and accurate methods to identify and characterize genomic breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts resulting from the many types of MLL rearrangements are essential for risk group stratification, treatment protocol assignments, new partner gene discovery, understanding leukemia etiology and pathogenesis, and elucidating the impact of less common MLL-partner genes on biology and prognosis. Due to the vast heterogeneity in partner genes, typical gene-specific PCR based methods are not practical, especially when cytogenetics are normal or do not suggest involvement of a known partner gene of MLL. We have advanced seven different panhandle PCR based methods for cloning 5'-MLL-partner gene-3' and 5'-partner gene-MLL-3' genomic breakpoint junctions and identifying 5'-MLL-partner gene-3' fusion transcripts, all of which employ a stem-loop template shaped schematically like a pan with a handle and amplify the template without knowledge of the unknown partner sequence using primers all derived from MLL alone.
