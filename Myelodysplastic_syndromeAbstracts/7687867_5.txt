FLT4 is a recently cloned receptor tyrosine kinase cDNA, which is characterized by seven immunoglobulin-like loops in its extracellular domain. We have previously mapped the FLT4 gene to chromosome segment 5q33-qter using somatic cell hybrids. Here we have refined the localization to band 5q35 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and show that the gene is translocated to chromosomes 2 and 6 in the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and t(5;6)(q35;p21) translocations, respectively, of Ki-I-positive lymphomas, as well as to chromosome 3 in the t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) translocation, which is occasionally found in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. No evidence was obtained for a rearrangement or deregulation of the translocated FLT4 gene. We further show that abundant FLT4 mRNA expression occurs only in erythroid and megakaryoblastoid cell lines among nine leukemia cell lines studied.
