Monosomy 18 and partial deletion of 18q are nonrandom events in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia (sAML). They are part of complex chromosome abnormalities, as shown in the present study of six patients with MDS and sAML. We compared occurrence of chromosome 18 abnormalities in these syndromes with that in de novo AML.
