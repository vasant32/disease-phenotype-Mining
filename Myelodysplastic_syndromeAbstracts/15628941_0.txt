OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of erythropoietin (EPO) and to study the extent of application of published recommendations for use in treating anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational retrospective study of patients with MDS receiving at least one dose of EPO. Patients were selected from the outpatient database at the Pharmacy Department, and the medical history as well as both clinical and pharmacotherapeutic data were collected. The clinical effectiveness of EPO was assessed at 6, 12, 16 and 24 weeks after treatment using two distinct criteria for erythroid response. Three items were defined and assessed for each patient in order to establish the extent of application of published recommendations on the efficient use of EPO. RESULTS: Eleven patients were enrolled. Three of them responded to EPO at some point during follow-up, according to pre-defined criteria. All three items used in the assessment of the efficient use of EPO showed significantly high inadequacy rates. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the effectiveness of EPO in the management of MDS-related anemia is similar to that described in the literature. However, upon the assessment of its use in our hospital, this drug was shown not to have been employed according to published recommendations, which promote its cost-effective use. We believe that the cooperation of the Pharmacy Department in the design of a protocol for EPO use in MDS is of interest, and would contribute to EPO's efficient use.
