Stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with leukemia has been a matter of debate since the first successful transplantation in a child with aplastic anemia in Germany in 1975. Since then, there has been a long way to implement fully stem cell transplantation strategies into the treatment studies organized within BFM Groups for first line or second line treatment of acute and chronic leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome. The role of different risk groups, different donors, stem cell sources and alternative approaches as haploidentical transplantation as well have been studied as the impact of chimerism and minimal residual disease. Finally, for all leukemias and myelosdysplastic syndromes integrated treatment pathways have been developed, which integrate stem cell transplantation on an evidence base into the treatment of the patient.
