Granulocytic sarcomas (chloromas) are rare extramedullary tumors consisting of primitive granulocytic cells. They arise de novo, or are associated with other hematologic disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative disorders. We report here on a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with a large swelling in her right groin and leg. The mass was confirmed by biopsy to be a granulocytic sarcoma. Bone marrow examination showed mild hypercellularity but no evidence of increase in blast count. However, cytogenetic examination of the marrow showed t(9;22), indicating an unexpected diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia.
