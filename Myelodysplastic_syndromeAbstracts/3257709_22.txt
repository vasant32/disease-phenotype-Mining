Immunocompetence was evaluated in 36 untreated and noninfected patients affected with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). T-cell number and activity were evaluated by counts of total T-cells and T-lymphocyte subsets, and by measure of DNA synthesis in response to phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A. B-cells were evaluated as surface immunoglobulin- (SIg+) bearing cells and by serum immunoglobulin levels. Granulocyte activities were evaluated by responses to chemotaxis and to nitroblue tetrazolium test. Complement activity was measured by classic hemolytic complement assay. In addition, circulating immune complexes were detected in serum. MDS were associated with a significant decrease in the absolute numbers of total T (E-rosetting and T3+) cells, T4+, and T8+ cells and a dramatic decrease of the responses to Concanavalin A. An impairment of either chemotaxis or of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was frequently encountered. An increase in the levels of IgG or IgA was also a frequent feature. The findings reveal that all patients with a high degree of T-cell impairment have refractory anemia associated with an excess of medullary blast cells. All in all, the data suggest that the counts of the absolute number of cells bearing the T3 and T8 phenotypes could be of prognostic value: the higher the number, the better the patient's survival.
