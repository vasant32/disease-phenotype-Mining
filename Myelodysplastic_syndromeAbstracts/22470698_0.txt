Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is also referred to non-lymphocytic leukemia in the literature. It comprises about 15% of the childhood leukemia. There are multiple subtypes of AML from M0-M7 with approximately 45% of the cases being M0-M2 and the remaining subtypes being rare. The definitive diagnosis relies on bone marrow biopsy showing bone marrow infiltration with leukemic cells. We describe a rare radiographic presentation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transformed to AML in an 8 month old boy who presented with a orbital wall fracture, periosteal reaction, and mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions.
