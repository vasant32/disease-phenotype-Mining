Of eight patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated with Roacutane (13-cis retinoic acid, Roche, Basel, (13-RA)) 20 mg/m2 for 6 weeks and an additional 100 mg/m2 for 4 weeks (3 patients), 4 responded either with a slight increase in peripheral blood neutrophil count or a decrease in myeloperoxidase deficient neutrophils. In agar cultures 2 patients showed a concurrent increase in growth of day 11 colonies and clusters. In 2 of the patients a decrease in the number of immature bone marrow cells positive for the myeloid antibody anti-My7 was observed. Only minor alterations were seen in natural killer cell activity. In 4 patients showing clonal chromosomal abnormalities before treatment a disappearance of minor clonal abnormalities during treatment was observed, and in 3 chromosomal abnormalities reappeared after cessation of therapy. Even though the overall impact of 13-RA on the hematopoietic system was minor, the increase in myeloperoxidase normal granulocytes in the blood and the decrease in My7 positive cells and in clonal chromosomal abnormalities warrants further interest in this agent as a treatment modality in MDS. The side effects, especially experienced by the patients receiving 100 mg/m2, were, in spite of symptomatic treatment, of such a degree that only low dose treatment (10-20 mg/m2) administered for prolonged periods of time (3-6 months) would seem recommendable.
