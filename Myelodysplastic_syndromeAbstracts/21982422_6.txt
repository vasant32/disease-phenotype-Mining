 BACKGROUND: The importance of matching at the HLA C locus has not been well defined for unrelated umbilical-cord blood transplantation. The selection algorithm for umbilical-cord blood units generally considers intermediate resolution HLA typing at A and B and allele-level typing at DRB1. We aimed to establish the relative importance of additional matching at HLA C. METHODS: We used Cox regression to assess retrospectively the effect of donor-recipient HLA matching on outcomes of single umbilical-cord blood transplantations for leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Our primary endpoint was transplant-related mortality. HLA typing was done with molecular techniques with a minimum of intermediate resolution for HLA A, B, and C, and at the allele-level for DRB1. FINDINGS: The median age of our study population was 10 years (range <1-62) and 552 (69%) of 803 patients were aged 16 years or younger at transplantation. Compared with transplantations matched at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 (n=69), transplant-related mortality risk was higher after transplantations matched at HLA A, B, and DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=23; HR 3·97, 95% CI 1·27-12·40; p=0·018). Transplant-related mortality risk was also higher after transplantations with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=234; 1·70, 1·06-2·74; p=0·029) compared with transplantations matched at HLA C with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 (n=127). Assessing the overall effect of HLA disparity on transplant-related mortality, risks were higher with units mismatched at two (n=259; 3·27, 1·42-7·54; p=0·006), three (n=253; 3·34, 1·45-7·71; p=0·005), or four (n=75; 3·51, 1·44-8·58; p=0·006) loci compared with matched units (n=69). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the present strategy for umbilical-cord blood unit selection should be reassessed; matching at HLA C for units that are matched at HLA A, B, or DRB1 or in the presence of a single locus mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 should be included to minimise mortality risks.
