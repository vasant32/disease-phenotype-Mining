Although the incidence of (myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) is higher among heart and lung transplant recipients than the general population, the same has not been shown in liver transplant (OLT) patients. We present the second known case of MDS after OLT. Case reports of MDS in OLT were identified using PubMed. Patient data were gathered from the patient and the medical record. A 54-year-old Caucasian man underwent OLT in 2003 and again in 2004 for hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. In 2007, the patient developed weakness, malaise, and shortness of breath. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy showed MDS, with refractory anemia and excess blasts-1. The patient underwent chemotherapy and reduction in immunosuppression without a clinical response. Our experience suggested that MDS, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancytopenia after OLT. Once diagnosed, immunosuppression reduction, chemotherapy, and even stem cell transplantation may be the appropriate treatment in selected candidates.
