We reported an autopsy case of a 58-year-old-man, who developed intractable organizing pneumonia accompanying myelodysplastic syndrome with neutrophil hypofunction. Slight clinical improvement was obtained by steroid pulse therapy, but re-exacerbation occurred during steroid tapering. Infection was suspected, and we administered antibiotics and antifungal agents, while holding steroid administration. However, both the clinical findings and images deteriorated. By both steroid and cyclosporine treatment, a slight improvement was temporarily obtained, but he died. The findings of lung tissue on autopsy showed extensive old and new organized pneumonia, and, as for the etiology of the intractable pneumonia, the likelihood of the lung infectious disease was considered most likely. In addition, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis led directly to death.
