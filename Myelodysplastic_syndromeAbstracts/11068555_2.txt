11q23 chromosomal abnormalities and rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene are important prognostic factors in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the presence of 11q23 abnormalities does not always correlate with that of MLL gene rearrangement. We retrospectively compared the occurrence of 11q23 abnormalities (measured by karyotyping) and MLL gene rearrangement (measured by Southern blotting) in bone marrow from 311 consecutive adult patients with AML or MDS. 11q23 abnormalities were found in 18 patients (5.8%), of whom 7 (39%) did not have the MLL gene rearrangement. MLL gene rearrangement was detected in 35 patients (11.2%). Of these 35 patients, only 11 (31%) had cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 abnormalities. None of the 21 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had 11q23 abnormalities or MLL gene rearrangement. 11q23 abnormalities were associated with shorter survival than was a diploid karyotype. Both cytogenetic and molecular studies should be performed to detect 11q23 abnormalities in patients with AML or MDS.
