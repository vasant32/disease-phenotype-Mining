Psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) was effective in the treatment of five patients with aquagenic pruritus, associated in one with polycythaemia rubra vera and in another with the myelodysplastic syndrome. Relapse occurred within 2-24 weeks when treatment was discontinued. Maintenance therapy or a further course of PUVA was necessary to maintain remission. This requirement may limit the value of the therapy.
