 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between GSTM1, GSTT1 and NQO1(C609T) genotypes and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) susceptibility and chromosome abnormalities. METHODS: GSTT1, GSTM1 and NQO1(C609T) genotypes were detected in 52 MDS patients and 241 unrelated controls by PCR or PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The incidence of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotype was significantly increased in MDS patients as compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In individuals with GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotype, the odds ratios for MDS risk were elevated to 2.873 (95% CI: 1.491-5.537) and 3.591 (95% CI: 1.717-7.508), respectively. A significantly increased frequency of GSTT(1) null genotype among MDS patients with normal karyotype and increased frequency of GSTM1 null genotype among MDS patients with chromosome abnormalities were found as compared to controls (OR = 5.336, P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, OR = 3.740, respectively). There was no difference in the incidence of NQO1(C609T) genotypes between MDS patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Determination of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes may be used as a stratification marker to predicate high-risk individuals for MDS.
