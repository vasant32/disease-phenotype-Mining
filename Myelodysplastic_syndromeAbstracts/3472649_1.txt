Ten patients with a hematologic disorder and a clone of cells with trisomy 9 in the bone marrow were studied in order to investigate the clinical significance of this chromosome anomaly. In five of the patients, trisomy 9 was the only anomaly; in four, there was also trisomy 8; and in one, a Y chromosome was also lacking. Four patients had a myelodysplastic syndrome, and six had a myeloproliferative disorder. Interestingly, four patients had primary thrombocytosis.
