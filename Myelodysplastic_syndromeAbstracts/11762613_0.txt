AIM: The present study was designed to analyse clinical, haematological and histomorphogical features in 37 cases of myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: FAB criteria was used to diagnose MDS in 37 patients. Clinical details, peripheral blood findings, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 37 cases, there were 25 females and 12 males in age range of 2 years to 75 years. There were three children. There were nine cases of refractory anaemia (RA), 18 of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), nine of refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and one of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). All were denovo MDS. All patients had pallor. Hepato and/or splenomegaly was seen in 15 cases. Anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was seen in 37, 6 and 23 cases respectively. Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was hyper to normo cellular in 35 cases. Dyshemopoiesis was seen in one or more cell lines in all cases. Bone marrow biopsy (BMB) was available in 16 cases. Abnormal localisation of immature precursors (ALIP) was seen in 11/12 biopsies of RAEB and 3/4 of RAEB-t. BMB was helpful in diagnosis of 3 doubtful cases (one RAEB and two RAEB-t), and upgrading of 2 cases of RAEB to RAEB-t. On follow up, 1 case of RA, 3 of RAEB, 1 of RAEB-t developed AML. One case of RAEB developed ALL and 2 progressed to RAEB-t. CONCLUSION: Primary MDS is seen in all age groups. Pallor is commonest presentation. RAEB was commonest subgroup seen. BMB is helpful in diagnosis of doubtful cases. ALIP is a reliable diagnostic feature of MDS. BMB is a diagnostic as well as prognostic tool in MDS cases which should be taken as a mandatory investigation.
