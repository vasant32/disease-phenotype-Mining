A patient with acute myelomegakaryocytic leukemia (AMMgL), which developed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after chemotherapy against complicated small cell lung cancer, is reported. The patient was a 66 year-old male, who first presented with moderate macrocytic anemia. Bone marrow aspiration showed absolute erythroid hypoplasia and morphological abnormalities were found in erythroid, granuloid and megakaryocytic lineage cells. Iron utilization studies using radioisotope showed ineffective hematopoiesis. He was diagnosed as having MDS (refractory anemia) and treated with prednisolone, fluoxymesterone, and transfusions. After 3 years, small cell lung cancer was found, but he achieved complete remission with chemotherapy. Since then, pancytopenia progressed with myelofibrosis. Abnormal blasts were found in peripheral blood and gradually increased. He finally died from a blastic crisis resulting in gastric bleeding. The blasts were peroxidase negative, platelet peroxidase positive (10%), and glycoprotein II b/III a antibody positive, indicating megakaryoblasts.
