Advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) carries a poor prognosis. In this phase I/II study, arsenic trioxide was combined with low-dose cytarabine in 49 previously untreated patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS. Complete remission was achieved in 8 (17%) patients, including 3/14 (21%) with treatment-related disease, 4/31 (13%) with unfavorable cytogenetics and 2/36 (6%) with baseline poor performance status. Mortality within the first 4 weeks was 8%. The regimen was active and had a tolerable extramedullary toxicity profile, but it was cumbersome and intensive compared to other currently available treatments.
