Two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)-like state after chemotherapy. Both patients showed morphological evidence of myelodysplasia together with acute leukemia at presentation (Case 1: M5b with trilineage myelodysplasia and Case 2: M4 with dysmegakaryocytopoiesis). They also showed persistent monocytosis without prominent blast cell proliferation after induction therapy. The possibility was suggested that these two patients were in acute transformation from CMMoL at presentation and returned to a CMMoL-like state after induction therapy.
