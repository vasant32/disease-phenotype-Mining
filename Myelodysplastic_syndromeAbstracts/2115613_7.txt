Thirty patients affected by previously untreated high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were treated with human recombinant gamma-interferon (r-IFN-gamma): 15 of them with a higher dose (HD) of 0.1 mg/sqm, three times a week and 15 with a lower dose (LD) of 0.01 mg/sqm, three times a week, both doses administered subcutaneously (s.c.). The therapy was fairly well tolerated and few major toxic events were documented. Sustained improvement of one or more clinico-hematologic parameters was observed in 43.3% of the patients (26.6% and 60.0% for the lower and higher dose, respectively). Median survival time from the start of IFN-gamma therapy was 15+ months (range: 1-26) for patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) versus 5 months (range 2-12) for patients with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t); 15+ months (range 1-26) for HD patients versus 8 months (range 2-23) for patients treated with LD regimen; 16+ months (range 9-26) for responders versus 7 months (range 1-22) for nonresponders. All these three variables (diagnosis, treatment, and response to treatment) turned out to be statistically significant (p = at least less than 0.01) at Cox's analysis.
