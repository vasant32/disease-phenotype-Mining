According to the classification of the World Health Organization, the designation myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder, unclassifiable may be applied to cases that have clinical, laboratory, and morphologic features that support a diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as well as a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), but that do not meet the criteria for any of the other entities included in the MDS/MPD category [3]. In this paper we report on two Caucasian patients with unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndromes with proliferative characteristics. Both patients were suffering from thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly and underwent splenectomy. The weight of the spleen specimens was more than 2000 g. Histopathology findings revealed a marked infiltration of the spleen with extramedullary hematopoiesis. After surgery, one patient showed a rapid increase of platelets in peripheral blood and developed severe thrombocytosis. In the other case, the patient was suffering from a decrease of platelets and died in hypovolemic shock caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. In summary, these two cases demonstrate the difficulties of prognosis and treatment in patients with mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders. Additionally, we indicate the potential positive outcome of splenectomy as ultima ratio in patients with these hematological features and severe thrombopenia.
