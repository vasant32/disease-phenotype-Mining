The study was aimed to investigate the abnormality of immunophenotypes in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its role in the identification of MDS. The cell immunophenotypes of 136 patients with hypocytosis accompanied by abnormal hematopoiesis of bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry, the detected results were evaluated by flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS), and the sensitivity and specificity of positive results were determined by FCSS also. The correlation of results detected by FCSS to traditional diagnosis method was analysed. The results indicated that 111 out of 136 cases were diagnosed as MDS, and 25 were diagnosed as non-MDS. Among 111 MDS cases, 85 cases were FCSS positive, 18 cases were FCSS intermediate and 8 cases were FCSS negative, whereas in 25 non-MDS cases 24 cases were FCSS negative, 1 case was FCSS intermediate and no case was FCSS positive. The sensitivity of FCSS in identification of MDS was 76.6%, and the specificity of FCSS was 100%. There was a good correlation of FCSS to traditional method (R = 0.613, p = 0.000). It is concluded that the various abnormalities of immunophenotyping are found in patients with MDS, in which the main immunophenotype abnormality and the abnormality involving two cell lineages are key points to distinguish MDS from non-MDS.
