Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a major problem in long-term cancer survivors, therefore early detection and prevention of therapy-related secondary neoplasia is an important issue. We searched for therapy-related MDS and analyzed cytogenetic changes in 155 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) from a single institution. Of the total 155 MM patients with cytogenetic results, 7 patients showed de novo appearance of myeloid-related cytogenetic changes, and 5/7 had -7/7q-, including 3 with der(1;7)(q10;p10): 3 patients developed MDS (i.e. 2 patients with der(1;7)(q10;p10) and 1 with a complex abnormality including -5 and 7q-). Among five patients receiving more than 2 g of melphalan, three developed MDS, and two of them showed der(1;7)(q10;p10) before or at the time of MDS diagnosis. Although morphologic identification of MDS was difficult in some cases, we concluded that the presence of 7q-, specifically der(1;7)(q10;p10), during chemotherapy involving melphalan for MM patients might indicate hidden MDS status and appropriate therapeutic options should be considered for such patients.
