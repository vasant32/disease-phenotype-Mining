We reported 37 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia or refractory anemia with excess blasts who were treated with cyclosporin A (CyA)/thalidomide combination therapy. Of them, 19 patients (19/37, 51.4%) achieved a hematologic improvement and erythroid response (HI-E); 9 patients (9/29, 31.0%) achieved hematologic improvement and platelet response (HI-P) and 7 patients (7/33, 21.2%) achieved hematologic improvement and neutrophil response (HI-N). 15 of 32 (46.9%) transfusion-dependent patients achieved independence from transfusion. The median response duration of HI-E, HI-P and HI-N were 88 (4-108) weeks, 78 (8-84+) weeks and 78 (10-84+) weeks, respectively. Some patients presented with I or II grade hepatic or nephritic impairment, constipation, lethargy, dizziness, edema, rash or sense of numbness. Therefore, CyA combined with thalidomide appears to be useful and is relatively well-tolerated for patients with MDS.
