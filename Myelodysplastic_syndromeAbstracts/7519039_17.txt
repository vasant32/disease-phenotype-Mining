A patient with aplastic anaemia developed Sweet's syndrome (a febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy. Three repeated episodes of appearance and disappearance of erythematous nodules after administration and withdrawal of G-CSF confirmed that G-CSF induced Sweet's syndrome in the patient. Sweet's syndrome has been reported in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia, but not in patients with aplastic anaemia. This is the first report of a patient with aplastic anaemia who developed G-CSF-induced Sweet's syndrome.
