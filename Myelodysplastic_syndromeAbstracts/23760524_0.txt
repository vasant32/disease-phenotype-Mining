The term epigenetics refers to the heritable changes in gene expression that do not represent changes in DNA sequence. DNA methylation and histone modification are the best studied epigenetic mechanisms. However, microRNAs, which affect gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, should be considered as members of the epigenetic machinery too. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clone disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell with increased risk of leukemic transformation. Over the years, increased number of studies indicates the role of epigenetic mechanisms, including microRNAs, in MDS pathogenesis and prognosis. Indeed, epigenetic therapy with demethylating agents has already been applied to MDS. In this review we summarize current knowledge on the role of epigenetic alterations in MDS pathogenesis and treatment.
