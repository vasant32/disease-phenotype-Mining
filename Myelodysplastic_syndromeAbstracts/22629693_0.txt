Anemia in IBD is the result of a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. Therapy of IBD is relief of inflammation, but the drugs usage may cause the development hemolytic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. We studied the effect of basic therapy on the incidence of anemia and assess the impact of modern biological therapies on the main markers of AHZ. A total of 153 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), which at the time of the study received basic anti-inflammatory therapy for at least 1 year. All patients underwent blood tests, iron metabolism parameters were determined by the level of erythropoietin and G-gepsidina C reactive protein. Modern biological therapy increases the effectiveness of the treatment of anemia in patients with IBD. The use of Remicade gives a quick positive response, which is due to the decrease of gepsidin negative influence on iron metabolism and unlocking the synthesis of erythropoietin. The use of MSCs does not inhibit the synthesis of erythropoietin, and is likely to stimulate erythropoiesis at the erythroblast precursors.
