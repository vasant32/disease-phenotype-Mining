 BACKGROUND: Isolated isochromosome (17q) is a rare cytogenetic abnormality in Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloid neoplasms, usually myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). De novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isochromosome 17q has rarely been reported. The frequency of genetic mutations is unknown. METHODS: The authors assessed clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of 22 myeloid neoplasms with isolated isochromosome 17q. RESULTS: Fourteen patients presented as MDS/MPN; 8 as de novo AML. Most presented with leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. Morphologically, all showed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, including pseudo-Pelger-Huet-like neutrophils, micromegakaryocytic hyperplasia, hypercellularity, fibrosis, and osteosclerosis. Blasts were increased (median, 40% in de novo AML; 9% in MDS/MPN). Immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation and apoptosis rates in AML were similar to a matched group without isochromosome 17q. In most patients, isochromosome 17q occurred at time of blast transformation or disease progression. DNA sequencing revealed no mutation in the uninvolved TP53 allele. Mutational analyses showed rare mutations in NRAS (3 of 10), FLT3 (2 of 16), and JAK2 (1 of 18), and no mutations in NPM1 (0 of 15), KIT (0 of 4), and CEBPA (0 of 4). The median overall survival was 14.5 months for de novo AML, and 11.0 months for MDS/MPN. With a median follow-up of 8.5 months (range, 1.5-107 months), 15 died of disease, 6 had persistent disease, and 1 was in remission after bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that myeloid neoplasms with isolated isochromosome 17q represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, high risk of leukemic transformation, and wild-type TP53.
