We describe a patient with basophilic leukaemia following a 2-year period with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anaemia). The marrow showed 59.4% of blasts with 25.0% of mature and immature basophils. The leukaemic blasts contained granules, positively stained with toluidine blue but negative for peroxidase. The basophilic differentiation was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis demonstrating immature basophil granules. In addition, a morphological transition from immature blasts to more mature basophils was observed. Immunophenotypic analysis of blasts and basophils showed positive for CD5, CD7, CD13, CD33 and CD34. Cytogenetic investigation showed an abnormal karyotype, 46,XY,del(5)(q31q35), in 11% of the cells examined when the initial diagnosis of refractory anaemia was made. However, expansion of the same clone up to 100% was observed concomitantly with transformation to basophilic leukaemia.
