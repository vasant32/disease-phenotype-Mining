From 1998 to 2001, 5 consecutive cases of AML/TMDS entered our hospital and achieved complete remission (CR) with continuous drip infusion of low-dose etoposide and low-dose Ara-C combined with mitoxantrone (MEtA regimen). The ages of the 5 patients (4 males and 1 female) ranged 32 to 50 years-old, respectively. WBCs were 1,560-45,150/microl, blasts were 12-62%. Bone marrow aspirates revealed trilineage myelodysplasia with various number of blasts. These patients had an acute onset and no preceding hematologic disorders. They were diagnosed M2/TMDS or M4/TMDS. Continuous drip infusion of etoposide (50 mg/body/day) and Ara-C (30 mg/body/day) were given for 11-14 days and a bolus injection of mitoxantrone (8 mg/m2) was added for 2-3 days. Patient 5 was given additional MIT (6.7 mg/m2 on day 6). All cases achieved CR in 21-24 days after the end of the therapy. Toxicities were nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia and fever due to infection. All were well tolerable, however. Two patients are alive more than 4 years without relapse. MEtA regimen is available for AML/TMDS.
