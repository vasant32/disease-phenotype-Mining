Familial myelodysplastic syndrome occurring at a young age is a very rare childhood haematological malignancy. Two siblings, aged three and 18 years, from a consanguineous marriage, presented with pancytopenia and was subsequently diagnosed to have myelodysplastic syndrome. Both remained clinically stable throughout the illness. Splenectomy appeared to have fully corrected the cytopenia in one of them.
