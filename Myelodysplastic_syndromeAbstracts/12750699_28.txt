Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has emerged as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. PBSCT can be associated with a higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). In this study, we investigated whether there was a correlation between the composition of PBSC grafts (CD34+ and CD3+ cells) and hematological recovery, GVHD, relapse, and relapse-free survival (RFS) after myeloablative HLA-identical sibling PBSCT. The evolution of 100 acute or chronic leukemia patients was analyzed. Neither hematological recovery, acute or cGVHD, nor relapse, was significantly associated with CD3+ cell dose. Increasing CD34+ stem cells was associated with faster neutrophil (P=0.03) and platelet (P=0.007) recovery. Moreover, 47 of the 78 patients evaluable for cGVHD (60%; 95% CI, 49-71%) developed extensive cGVHD. The probability of extensive cGVHD at 4 years was 34% (95% CI, 21-47%) in patients receiving a 'low' CD34+ cell dose (<8.3 x 10(6)/kg), as compared to 62% (95% CI, 48-76%) in patients receiving a 'high' CD34+ cell dose (>8.3 x 10(6)/kg) (P=0.01). At a median follow-up of 59 months, this has not translated into a difference in relapse. In patients evaluable for cGVHD, RFS was significantly higher in patients receiving a 'low' CD34+ cell dose as compared to those receiving a 'high' CD34+ cell dose (P=0.04). This difference was mainly because of a significantly higher cGVHD-associated mortality (P=0.01). Efforts to accelerate engraftment by increasing CD34+ cell dose must be counterbalanced with the risk of detrimental cGVHD.
