The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 14 patients with MDS were treated with allo-HSCT, out of them 9 patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related donors, while 5 donors were unrelated. 1 patient received bone marrow transplantation and other 13 patients received peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The modified BU/CY conditioning regimen was used in 11 patients, TBI+CY in 2 patients and reduced intensity FB conditioning regimen in 1 patient. CsA + MTX + MMF were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients with allo-HSCT from unrelated donors or HLA-mismatched donors received rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG). The results showed that 12 ALL patients successfully reconstructed their haematopoietic system. The time from transplantation to ANC > 1.0 x 10(9)/L and Plt > 50 x 10(9)/L were 12 (11 - 16) days and 13 (11 - 19) day after transplantation respectively. 11 patients survival free disease and their longest survival time had been up to 125 months. 1 case died early because of cerebral hemorrhage. 1 case died at 66 day because of aGVHD IV, alimentary tract hemorrhage and multiple organ failure.1 case relapsed at 8 months and died of marrow failure at 17 months. Over survival (OS) rate was 78.6% and disease free survival (DFS) was 84.6%. The main complications were aGVHD of I-II grade in 6 cases. It is concluded that allo-HSCT is a safe and effective option for the patients with MDS.
