According to several reports, the 10 year incidence of secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after systemic chemotherapy is approximately 1.5%. The cumulative risk increases by 0.25--1% for the first 8 years after treatment. We have reported only 6 cases of hematological malignancies (0.3%) after breast cancer chemotherapy in our institute. We detected 2 cases of secondary AML and 1 case of MDS, 19, 52 and 12 months, respectively, after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer. Published data on the occurrence of secondary hematological malignancies other than AML or MDS in this setting are scarce. We encountered diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma as secondary hematological malignancies after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer.
