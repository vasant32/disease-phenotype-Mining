Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with frequent cytogenetic abnormalities. They can arise de novo or be related to therapy. Although blasts in MDS have been studied extensively, there is little information available on the mature, non-blast myeloid cells (NBMCs). We used a retrospective case-control study design. NBMC populations in MDS (48 cases) and in tumor-free control (12 cases) bone marrow samples were analyzed using multiparameter flow cytometry for mean side scatter (SSC) channel number and for expression of aberrant cell surface antigens. MDS cases were stratified on the basis of cytogenetic abnormalities. We report that NBMCs in MDS with normal karyotype expressed significantly higher HLA-DR than controls (P = 0.034). NBMCs in MDS cases with cytogenetic abnormalities and with > or =5% marrow blasts, compared with controls, had significantly higher CD34 and higher HLA-DR but lower CD10 and lower SSC mean channel number. CD34 expression in NBMCs was significantly greater in therapy-related MDS compared with de novo MDS ( P = 0.01), although the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities was not different ( P > 0.05). These data suggest that bone marrow, mature, NBMCs have phenotypic changes in MDS that are not seen in normal controls.
