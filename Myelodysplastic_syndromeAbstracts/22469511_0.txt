In chronic myelogenous leukemia, chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells are rare and usually transient, but can infrequently lead to myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia. We report an 82-ear-old patient with an 11-year history of chronic myelogenous leukemia, in complete cytogenetic response, who developed Philadelphia-negative t(15;17)/PMLRARA acute promyelocytic leukemia. This isolated case reaffirms several important clinicopathologic and biologic aspects of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and sheds a unique light on its Philadelphia-negative hematopoiesis. It also underlines the importance of continued cytogenetic monitoring of patients in complete cytogenetic response for the emergence of new chromosomal abnormalities.
