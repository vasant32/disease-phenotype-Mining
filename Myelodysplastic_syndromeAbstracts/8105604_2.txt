An immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis was performed on bone marrow trephine biopsies in 40 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to evaluate the proliferative activity in erythropoiesis and the endoreduplicative capacity of megakaryocytes. Control groups included normal bone marrow and marrow from cases presenting with pernicious anaemia. Double-immunostaining was applied with a monoclonal antibody (PC10) directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), followed by antibodies against glycophorin C (Ret40f) or platelet glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51-CD61) for the identification of the erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lineage. Comparison with normal bone marrow showed a reduction of erythropoiesis accompanied by an increase in atypical (micro-) megakaryocytes. Erythroid precursors displayed significant enhancement of PCNA-immunostaining. Megakaryocytes showed no increase in the relative frequency of PC10-positive cells (PCNA-labelling index). In pernicious anaemia, predominance of macrocytic-megaloblastoid erythropoiesis was associated with a striking increase in PCNA-labelling. Cell kinetic studies in this disorder revealed an abnormal arrest, particularly in S-phase which generates an over-expression of PCNA. Similar conditions were believed to be present in MDS with secondary folate deficiency. This mechanism explains the relatively high rate of positively-reacting pro- and erythroblasts which is not invariably accompanied by an increase in cell proliferation. Determination of megakaryocyte size and PCNA-staining capacity resulted in a significant increase in PC10-positive cells among micromegakaryocytes. Our findings on this cell lineage are in keeping with the assumption of a block in endoreduplicative activity at higher ploidy levels, associated with an apparently not-deregulated endomitosis in small-sized megakaryocytes of lower ploidy stages.
