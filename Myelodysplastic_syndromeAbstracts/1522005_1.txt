An autopsy was performed on a 72-y-old Caucasian female who had received a carotid artery injection of thorium dioxide in 1953. The body was dissected in such a manner as to provide for radiobiological evaluation as well as to determine histologically the distribution of Thorotrast in the tissues and its complications. Thorotrast was identified within the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and surrounding the right carotid artery (the injection site). The cause of death was gastric hemorrhage complicating pancytopenia secondary to refractory anemia with excess of blasts (myelodysplastic syndrome).
