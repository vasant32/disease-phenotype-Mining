We examined the feasibility of a community blood bank granulocyte transfusion program utilizing community donors stimulated with a single-dose regimen of subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus oral dexamethasone. The recipients of these transfusions were neutropenic stem cell transplantation patients with severe bacterial or fungal infection. Nineteen patients received 165 transfusions (mean 8.6 transfusions/patient, range 1-25). Community donors provided 94% of the transfusions; relatives accounted for only 6% of the transfusions. Sixty percent of the community donors initially contacted agreed to participate, and 98% of these individuals indicated willingness to participate again. Transfusion of 81.9 +/- 2.3 x 10(9) neutrophils (mean +/- SD) resulted in a mean 1-hour posttransfusion neutrophil increment of 2. 6 +/- 2.6 x 10(3)/microL and restored the peripheral neutrophil count to the normal range in 17 of the 19 patients. The buccal neutrophil response, a measure of the capacity of neutrophils to migrate to tissue sites in vivo, was restored to normal in most patients following the transfusion. Chills, fever, and arterial oxygen desaturation of >/= 3% occurred in 7% of the transfusions, but these changes were not sufficient to limit therapy. Infection resolved in 8 of 11 patients with invasive bacterial infections or candidemia. These studies indicate that transfusion of neutrophils from donors stimulated with G-CSF plus dexamethasone can restore a severely neutropenic patient's blood neutrophil supply and neutrophil inflammation response. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this therapy.
