BACKGROUND: A patient with multiple myeloma developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Chromosomal analysis performed after the development of MDS revealed monosomy of chromosome 9 in all the meta-phases. We wished to identify the extent of the clone with the chromosomal abnormality originating from MDS clone. METHODS: A correlative interphase study by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed and we determined whether each lineage of cells obtained the molecular mark. The chromosome 9 classic alpha satellite region DNA was used as a probe for the FISH analysis in smear specimens stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. RESULTS: Erythroblasts, granulocytes and myelocytes had only one signal, whereas myeloma cells showed two to four signals. CONCLUSION: This study visualized the spectrum of MDS clone. The results suggest that the origin of MDS is different from that of multiple myeloma, at least in this case.
