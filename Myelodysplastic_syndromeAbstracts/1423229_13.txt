In the present study, chromosome changes in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) cells from 13 patients with malignant hematologic disorders were analyzed by classical cytogenetic techniques (G-banding) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) procedures using centromere specific probes for chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 18, 13/21, and X, and a DNA probe specific for the long arm of chromosome Y. The cytogenetic data obtained with G-banding were in accord with those obtained by FISH to metaphase chromosomes. Most significantly, FISH to interphase nuclei offered reliable results and in some cases provided important information concerning crucial chromosome anomalies which were not or could not be completely detected by analyzing metaphase chromosomes. Our results indicate that FISH could be clinically valuable in five major areas: 1) marker chromosome identification; 2) identification of trisomy consistent with certain specific hematological neoplasms; 3) clonal evaluation post observation of a single cell with trisomy; 4) clonal evaluation post-sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT); and 5) residual disease detection following clinical remission.
