Pancytopenia with severe bone marrow dysplasia following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (M6) may pose a diagnostic problem. We report a case of M6 acute myeloid leukemia in which progressive macrocytosis, pancytopenia and severe bone marrow dysplasia induced by acetazolamide therapy developed after successful engraftment of a donor marrow. We discuss the diagnostic problems and the usefulness of conventional cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation in excluding recipient myelodysplasia relapse. We also suggest that acetazolamide should be used with caution, especially following bone marrow transplantation.
