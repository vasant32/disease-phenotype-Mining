A cytogenetic study was performed in 27 patients suspected of t-MDS or t-ANLL. In 12 patients the diagnosis of t-MDS or t-ANLL was confirmed by morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotypical analysis. The cases were classified as RA (one), RAEB (four), CMML (two), ANLL (five). They had received chemotherapy and/or RT for Hodgkin's disease (eight cases), solid tumours (three cases) and multiple myeloma (one case). Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells in all the 12 cases. Five patients had a clonal abnormality of chromosome no. 5 (monosomy, deletions, translocation and inversion of 5q). The critical region on chromosome no. 5 comprised bands q12-q34. Monosomy and deletion of chromosome 7q was observed in the other two patients. In the six remaining patients various karyotypic patterns were observed including a t(4;11) (q21;q23) in one case, monosomies (four cases) and trisomies (one case) of different chromosomes. In the other 15 cases, the presence of a normal karyotype together with the morphological and immunophenotypical characterisation was consistent with a diagnosis of non-neoplastic specimens.
