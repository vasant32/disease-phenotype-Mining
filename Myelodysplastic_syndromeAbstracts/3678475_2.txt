147 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were investigated for the presence of micronuclei and nuclear budding in bone marrow erythroblasts. The patients were divided into subgroups on the basis of bone marrow karyotype, 31 healthy bone marrow donors constituted a control group. Patients with monosomy 7 or 7q- and patients with major karyotypic abnormalities (MAKA) had significantly more erythroblasts with micronuclei and nuclear budding than the control group. Patients with a 5q- chromosome as the sole karyotypic aberration had more micronuclei than the controls. For other patients with MDS the differences were statistically nonsignificant.
