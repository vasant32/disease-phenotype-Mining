The efficacy and the safety of meropenem (MEPM), a newly developed carbapenem antibiotic, were investigated in 150 patients with severe infections complicated with hematopoietic disorders. 1. Clinical responses in 132 patients who were evaluable for effectiveness were excellent in 33 patients, good in 45, fair in 10 and poor in 44, with an efficacy rate of 59.1%. 2. The efficacy rate in patients who had previously been treated with the other antibiotics was 51.2%, while that in patients who had not been thus treated was 62.9%. 3. The efficacy rate in patients whose neutrophil counts increased during the therapy with MEPM was higher than that in patients whose neutrophil counts did not increase. The efficacy rate in patients whose neutrophil counts during the therapy were below 100/mm3 was 48.1%. 4. Out of 150 cases, side effects were observed in 4 patients, 3 with eruption and 1 with jaundice. Abnormalities in laboratory test results on liver functions were noted in 8 patients. These results indicate that MEPM is an effective and safe antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections in patients with hematopoietic disorders.
