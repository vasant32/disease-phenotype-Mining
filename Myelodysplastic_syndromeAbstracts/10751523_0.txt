OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between 11q23 abnormalities and the clinical, hematologic, prognostic aspects of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: A total of 6000 cases of hematologic malignancies from our hospital and near regions in China were investigated between October 1985 and November 1998. Chromosome preparations were made on bone marrow cells by using direct method and/or unstimulated short-term cultures. Karyotypes were analyzed by R-banding technique and expressed according to ISCN(1995). RESULTS: 11q23 abnormalities were found in 28 of 6000 cases with hematologic malignancies(0.47%). It may be separated into seven cytonetic categories: t(4;11)(q21;q23)(ten cases), t(11;19)(q23;p13)(five cases), t(9;11)(p12;q23)(two cases), t(10;11)(p15;q23)(two cases), t(6;11)(q27;q23) (one case), del(11)(q23)(seven cases), and t(11;?)(q23;?)(one case). The diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia in 14 cases (M(2a), three; M(4), two; M(5a), one; M(5b), eight), acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) in 10 cases, myelodysplastic syndrome in three cases and malignant histiocytosis in one case. All 10 cases with t(4;11) anomaly were ALL. Follow-up data were available for 22 of them. Their median survival was 113 days. The patients may be grouped according to the presence or absence of additional abnormalities and/or normal karyotype. The median survival was 75 days for five patients with 11q23 anomaly only, 18 days for two patients with 11q23 and additional abnormalities, 135 days for 10 patients with 11q23 anomaly, additional abnormalities and normal karyotype, and 150 days for 5 patients with 11q23 anomaly and normal karyotype. CONCLUSION: 11q23 abnormalities were mainly seen in ALL and acute monocytic leukemia. Their prognosis was very poor. Both additional abnormalities and lack of normal karyotype had adverse effects on the survival of patients. Thus, they represent a unique clinical-cytogenetic association. 11q23 abnormality; hematologic malignancy; acute monocytic leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; prognosis
