Cytogenetic investigations, including the analysis of karyotype indicated by G-banding and FISH for Ph chromosome, were performed in the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), classified according to FAB system. In RA we have not revealed any important karyotype abnormalities. In patients with RAEB we have detected monosomy 7, considered an unfavourable prognostic sign. There was found an unidentified marker chromosome in the patient with CMML. Diagnostic and prognostic value of karyotype investigation in MDS patients was discussed.
