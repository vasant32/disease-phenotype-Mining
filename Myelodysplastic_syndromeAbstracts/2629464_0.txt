Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to detect the structural change accompanying the activation of oncogenes in hematological malignancies and preleukemic states. Point mutation of N-ras oncogene was examined by oligonucleotide differential hybridization coupled with PCR. Five out of 17 AML patients were shown to have mutated N-ras gene. These mutations could be used as a genetic marker to diagnose the residual malignant cells. Philadelphia chromosome in CML was examined by cDNA synthesis and PCR with successful results. PCR was shown to be a highly versatile and sensitive method which would be invaluable in clinical diagnosis.
