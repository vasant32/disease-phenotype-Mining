WT1 (Wilms' tumor gene 1) protein is a potent pan-tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells) are spontaneously induced in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We conducted a single-cell level comparative analysis of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCR-BV) gene families of a total of 1242 spontaneously induced WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in HLA-A*2402(+) patients with AML or MDS and those in healthy donors (HDs). This is the first report of direct usage analysis of TCR-BV gene families of individual TAA-specific CD8(+) T cells at single-cell level. Usage analysis using single-cell RT-PCR of TCR-BV gene families of individual FACS-sorted WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells showed for the first time (i) that BVs 5, 6, 20, and 27 were commonly biased in both HDs and patients; (ii) that BV4 was commonly biased in HDs and MDS patients; (iii) that BV19 was commonly biased in the patients; and (iv) that BVs 7 and 28, BVs 9 and 15, and BVs 12 and 29 were specifically biased in HDs, AML, and MDS patients, respectively. However, statistical analysis of similarity among HD, AML, and MDS of individual usage frequencies of 24 kinds of TCR-BV gene families indicated that the usage frequencies of TCR-BV gene families in AML and MDS patients reflect those in HDs. These findings represent a novel insight for a better understanding of WT1-specific immune response.
