 BACKGROUND: Currently, all treatments for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are still experimental. Supportive care, including treatment of infection and transfusion of blood and blood-related products, remains the most important aspect of therapy in these cases. This article discusses the results of partial splenic embolization in a patient who had MDS with refractory anemia. METHODS: The patient was placed under observation and was given supportive treatment. In addition to MDS with refractory anemia, there were management difficulties related to severe thrombocytopenia after alloimmunization from multiple blood transfusions. Therefore it is thought that partial splenic embolization might be an alternative treatment for the management thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: Although the patient did not live long because of the sepsis and ileus, hematologic response was obtained. CONCLUSION: The observation during the treatment in this case suggests that partial splenic embolization may be a valid new alternative for treating thrombocytopenia due to alloimmunization.
