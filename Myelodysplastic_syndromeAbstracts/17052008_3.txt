Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is extramedullary tumor composed of immature leukemic cells. GS is presenting usually as a complication during the course of hematologic neoplasm, such as acute myeloblastic leukemia as well as myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndrome. The tumor was also called chroloma based on the green color of the tumorous mass. Central nervous system manifestations of GS are extremely rare. We report a 41-year-old man with acute leukemia type M7, who developed GS in the right occipital lobe after complete remission was achieved. Operative findings revealed the color of the hard tumor was greenish, which suggested the tumor was chroloma. Histological findings showed the tumor was GS. The majority of reported cases of GS in acute myeloid leukemia were M2 FAB classification and have chromosome translocation. Our patient was M7 FAB classification, not have specific chromosome translocation. GS occurrence in AML: M7 patient was extremely rare. This is the first case report of AML: M7 with GS in the central nervous system.
