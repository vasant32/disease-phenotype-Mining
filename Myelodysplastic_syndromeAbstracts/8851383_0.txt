Underlying diseases, pathogenic bacteria, clinical background and outcome were studied during 91 febrile episodes complicated by sepsis in 55 patients with hematological malignancies, who had been admitted to our hospital (Jikei University Kashiwa Hospital) between January 1990 and December 1994. Particularly in patients with P. aeruginosa sepsis, we compared the prophylactic effect of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) alone with that of the combination of polymyxin B (PL-B) plus kanamycin (KM). The major underlying diseases were acute myelocytic leukemia and malignant lymphoma, followed by myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia. Nearly two-thirds of the pathogenic microorganisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria (including coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus); approximately one-quarter were gram-negative bacteria (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the remainder were fungi. These microorganisms usually induced sepsis when granulocyte counts were decreased. Sepsis was a direct cause of death in about 60% of the patients and P. aeruginosa sepsis had the worst outcome. Oral administration of CPFX was more effective than PL-B plus KM in preventing P. aeruginosa sepsis. The difference in effectiveness might depend on the absorption profile of the drugs.
