The syndrome of ataxia-pancytopenia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathies, pancytopenia and a predilection to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. The genetic basis of this condition is unknown. We describe a child who presented with ataxia and pancytopenia and was found to have a heterozygous mutation, c.845G>A (Arg282His) in TINF2, a gene recently reported to be mutated in a subset of patients with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita. We propose that some cases of ataxia-pancytopenia may be affected by DC.
