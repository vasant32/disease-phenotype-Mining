 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of survivin mRNA in hematological malignancy cells and its correlation with HHT-induced cell apoptosis. METHODS: Hematological malignancy cell lines MUTZ-1, K562, Jurkat, RPMI and HL60 were treated with HHT in vitro. Cell apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry (FCM) and the expression of surviving and XIAP mRNA was evaluated with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULT: The expression of survivin mRNA on cell lines was negatively correlated to HHT-induced cell apoptotic rate (r=-0.980, P=0.003). There were no significant differences in XIAP expression among these 5 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Survivin could be used as a new marker for drug-sensitivity and a new target for treatment of hematological malignancies.
