Procoagulant activity (PCA) of peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) was evaluated in patients with primary thrombocythemia (PT, group A), polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) and myelodysplastic syndromes (group B), and in 15 healthy subjects as control group. PCA of PMC was assayed under basal conditions and after agonist-induced stimulation: bacterial lipopolysaccharide, glycosylated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, recombinant alpha-interferon. PCA was similar in the control group and group A when no stimulation was used, while PCA was found significantly higher in group B patients in the same conditions. In group A patients and in the control group, but not in group B patients, a lower PCA expression was found when PMC were simultaneously coincubated with LPS and alpha-interferon with respect to LPS incubation alone.
