Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by normal or hypercellular but dysfunctional bone marrow. They usually are refractory to empirical therapeutic regimens. Recently the prevalence of MDS in the elderly is increasing and now the syndromes are relatively commonly encountered in elderly patients. Two major causes of death in MDS are progression to acute leukemia (especially in subtypes of RAEB and RAEB in T), and bone marrow aplasia. Since cytoreductive therapy for RAEB or RAEB in T in the elderly is often accompanied by serious adverse complications, such as infection and hemorrhage, special care is necessary. Here we describe successful induction remission in a 74-year-old man with MDS (RAEB in T) by twice daily low-dose cytosine arabinoside injections (10 mg/m2, s.c.), which was well-tolerated, free of serious adverse effects, and seemed to be a useful therapeutic option for elderly patient with RAEB or RAEB in T.
