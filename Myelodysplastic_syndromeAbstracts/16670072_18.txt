The present study evaluated the combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CsA) in patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Twenty patients (17 with refractory anemia and 3 with refractory anemia with excess blasts) received treatment with rabbit-ATG plus CsA. The overall response rate was 30% (6/20); three of the six responders had a complete response. The responses lasted 2-58 months, with two patients still being in complete remission at 42 and 58 months. Short-lasting cytogenetic remissions were achieved in two patients. ATG was poorly tolerated in patients over 70 years of age. Four out of 20 patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia within a year. We conclude that immunosuppressive treatment may be a therapeutic option for selected patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
