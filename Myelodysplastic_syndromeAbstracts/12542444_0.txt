The mean platelet component (MPC) is a new platelet parameter generated by the Bayer ADVIA 120 full blood count analyser as part of the routine complete blood count (CBC) test cycle. We report a case of myelodysplasia with bleeding complications and abnormal template bleeding time in whom low mean platelet component parameters were associated with partial platelet granule deficiency, demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. We suggest that the mean platelet component is an inexpensive and rapid test to screen for platelet dysfunction related to ultrastructural abnormalities in myelodysplasia.
