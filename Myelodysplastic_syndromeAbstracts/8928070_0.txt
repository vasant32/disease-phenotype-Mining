Basing on computer processing of 126 primary clinical and laboratory parameters obtained from 92 patients with myelodysplasia and using multifactorial regression analysis, the authors have developed prognostic models of life span and probability of transformation into acute leukemia. The model of life span enabled recognition of 3 prognostic groups of myelodysplasia patients: of high (median 10 months), moderate (median 22 months) and low (median 35 months) risk. This makes it possible to prognosticate the disease and assume optimal therapeutic policy.
