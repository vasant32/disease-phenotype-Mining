We report an autopsy case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a 35-year-old male, who presented with pancytopenia and bleedings. Bone marrow specimens disclosed myelofibrosis and hypercellular marrow with more than 60% atypical erythroblasts in the bone marrow cells. Type I or type II blasts were less than 10% of the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells during the clinical course. At autopsy, infiltration by myeloid and erythroid cells and megakaryocytes was noted in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. According to the FAB classification, this case might be classified into refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation. However, the remarkable neoplastic proliferation of three haematopoietic cell lines also indicates acute myeloproliferative disorder such as acute myelofibrosis or acute panmyelosis.
