A 70-year-old male known with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was admitted with effort angina and fever, which developed into unstable angina. On coronary angiography a critical stenosis of the left main coronary artery and 75% stenosis of the right coronary artery were found. On complete blood count the number of leukocytes was 1600/µl. We administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) twice daily to increase the number of leucocytes. After two days the number of leukocytes had increased to 8700/µl. The patient was admitted to the operating room and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully.
