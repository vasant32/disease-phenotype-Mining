 PURPOSE: To analyze outcome, prognostic factors, and toxicities in patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) who received involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) before high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue (ASCR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and August 2006, 164 patients with relapsed or refractory DLCL received IFRT at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR. IFRT was delivered to involved sites measuring more than 5 cm or to sites with residual disease more than 2 cm. Radiotherapy was administered in 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily to a total dose of 30 Gy. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated, and short- and long-term toxicity was assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). Median follow-up was 60 months (range, 2 to 187 months). RESULTS: Two- and 5-year progression-free survival was 62% and 53%; 2- and 5-year overall survival was 67% and 58%, respectively. Sixty-seven patients relapsed; only 10 patients relapsed completely within the radiotherapy field. There were seven early treatment-related mortalities and 11 secondary cancers (including four myelodysplastic syndromes), one of which occurred within the IFRT site and five after total-body irradiation. CONCLUSION: Minimal treatment-related mortality and morbidity resulted from short, intensive, involved-field radiotherapy before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR, which was incorporated into a salvage regimen for patients with relapsed/refractory DLCL. This chemoradiotherapy salvage regimen resulted in a low local relapse rate that could potentially translate into an improved total outcome.
