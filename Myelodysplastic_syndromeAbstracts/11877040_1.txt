OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of operative region hypermethylation gene in human malignant hematopoietic tumors. METHODS: The abnormal methylation rate of P(15)(INK4B) gene 5'CpG island in 68 cases of malignant hematopoietic tumor samples were determined by methylation specific PCR using bisulfite modified DNA. RESULTS: The methylation rates of P(15)(INK4B) were 84%, 0, 50% and 75%, respectively, for 25 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 15 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 16 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 12 multiple myeloma (MM). P(15)(INK4B) gene was frequently methylated in patients with high risk MDS and early stage of MM. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of P(15)(INK4B) gene is one of the main causes of its inactivation. Hypermethylation of CpG island was closely related to the development of malignant hematopoietic diseases.
