In an attempt to identify novel diagnostic markers for mast cell (MC)-proliferative disorders, serial bone marrow (bm) sections of 22 patients with mastocytosis (systemic indolent mastocytosis, n = 19; mast cell leukemia [MCL], n = 1; isolated bm mastocytosis, n = 2) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against CD2, CD15, CD29, CD30, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD51, CD56, CD68R, CD117, HLA-DR, bcl-2, bcl-x(L), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and tryptase. Staining results revealed expression of bcl-x(L), CD68R, and tryptase in neoplastic MCs (focal dense infiltrates) in all patients. Mastocytosis infiltrates were also immunoreactive for CD45, CD117 (Kit), and HLA-DR. In most cases, the CD2 antibody produced reactivity with bm MCs in mastocytosis, whereas in control cases (reactive bm, immunocytoma, myelodysplastic syndrome), MCs were consistently CD2 negative. Expression of bcl-2 was detectable in a subset of MCs in the patient with MCL, whereas no reactivity was seen in patients with SIM or bm mastocytosis. Mastocytosis infiltrates did not react with antibodies against CD15, CD30, CD31, CD34, or MPO. In summary, our data confirm the diagnostic value of staining for tryptase, Kit, and CD68R in mastocytosis. Apart from these, CD2 may be a novel useful marker because MCs in mastocytosis frequently express this antigen, whereas MCs in other pathologic conditions are CD2 negative.
