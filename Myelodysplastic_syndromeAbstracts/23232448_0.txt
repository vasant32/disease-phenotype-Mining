We present the case of a 68-year old gentleman with previously diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome with pancytopenia who presented with exophthalmia, rhinorrhea, and ophthalmoplegia. Nasal endoscopy revealed black necrotic lesions. He was diagnosed with rhino-orbital mucormycosis and commenced on intravenous antifungals. Despite this therapy he progressed to have total unilateral loss of visual acuity and cutaneous necrosis. He underwent emergency orbital exenteration and extensive cheek and sinus debridement. Necrotic lesions were found in the orbit, the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses. He underwent reconstruction of this defect using a free myocutaneous ALT flap with a segment of vastus lateralis. Prior to surgery his anemia and thrombocytopenia were addressed with packed red cell and platelet transfusions as well as preoperative thromboelastography (TEG) to measure functional fibrinogen to platelet ratio. Intraoperative platelet administration was guided by repeated TEG analysis. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative bleeding complications and both flap and donor site healed unremarkably. Few reports exist in the literature related to free tissue transfer in patients with hematological disorders but low platelet count has been implicated in an increased complication rate.
