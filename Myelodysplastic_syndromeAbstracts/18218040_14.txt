Transfusion-related morbidity is an emerging challenge in chronically transfused patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In these patients, transfusion-induced iron overload may represent a leading medical problem. However, although iron-chelating drugs are available, little is known about optimal diagnostic tools, predisposing factors, and the optimal management of these patients. In the current article, we provide recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of iron overload in MDS and propose treatment response criteria. Consensus criteria and resulting recommendations were discussed and formulated by members of the MDS platform of the Austrian Society of Haematology and Oncology in a series of meetings and conferences in 2006 and 2007. These recommendations should facilitate and assist in recognition of iron overload, selection of patients, timing of treatment, drug selection and the measurement of treatment responses.
