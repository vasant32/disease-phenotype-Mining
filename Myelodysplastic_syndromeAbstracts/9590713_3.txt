A 59-year-old man, who manifested lower back pain, was admitted with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A computed tomographic scan showed a slight thickening of the abdominal aortic wall. A blood examination revealed pancytopenia. Myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed after bone marrow aspiration and a chromosome analysis. Sepsis due to a Staphylococcus aureus infection and DIC subsided after medical treatment; however, an aortobifemoral bypass was performed upon the detection of a localized rupture of a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm 1 month later. The patient is still alive 2 years after operation despite the presence of a hematological disorder.
