 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present a retrospective analysis of 99 consecutive patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who were older than 65 years at the time of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous progenitor cell transplantation. RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 68 years (range 65-82). Thirty-six percent of patients had a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index of >2 at the time of transplantation. The cumulative nonrelapse mortality was 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4-17] at 26 months and the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 61% (95% CI 49-71). On multivariate analysis, disease status at transplant and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > normal were significant predictors for OS (P = 0.002). Comorbidity index of >2 did not impact OS but did predict for higher risk of developing grade 3-5 toxicity (P = 0.006). Eight patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia after transplantation (cumulative incidence 16%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed lymphomas who are >65 years of age should be considered transplant candidates, particularly if they have chemosensitive disease and normal LDH levels at the time of transplantation. Patients with comorbidity index of >2 can also undergo transplantation with acceptable outcomes but may be at higher risk for developing toxicity.
