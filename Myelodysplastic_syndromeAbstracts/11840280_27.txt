Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha by a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept; Enbrel) improved in vitro hemopoiesis from the marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Therefore, we enrolled 14 MDS patients (4 RA, 2 RARS, 6 RAEB, 2 CMML), 44-80 (median 60) years old, in a pilot trial. Etanercept, 25 mg, was given twice a week s.c. for 16 weeks (increased to three times a week if no response at 8 weeks). Among 12 evaluable patients, four had rises in hemoglobin by 1-1.5 gm/dl (three) or decreased transfusion requirements (one). Two patients had increased platelet counts (54% and 73%), and two increased neutrophils (63% and 120%). Baseline TNFalpha levels, determined in all patients, did not correlate with responses. Among eight marrows available for sequential in vitro assays, four showed increases in CFU-GM of 1.5- to 5-fold at 8 weeks, whereas three showed 3- to 10-fold decrements relative to baseline. Thus, etanercept treatment resulted in moderate improvements of cytopenias in some patients, while cell counts declined in others. Additional trials are needed to evaluate its clinical efficacy in MDS.
