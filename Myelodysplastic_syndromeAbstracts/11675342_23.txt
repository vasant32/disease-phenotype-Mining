Iron is essential for cell proliferation, heme synthesis, and a variety of cellular metabolic processes. In most cells, transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis is a major pathway for cellular iron uptake. Recently, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), another receptor for transferrin, was cloned. High levels of expression of TfR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) occur in the liver, as well as in HepG2 (a hepatoma cell line) and K562 (an erythroid leukemia cell line). In this study, TfR2 mRNA expression was analyzed in hematological cell lines, normal erythroid cells at various stages of differentiation, and leukemia and preleukemia cells. High levels of TfR2 expression occurred in all of the erythroid cell lines that were examined. Erythroid-specific expression of TfR2 protein in bone marrow cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of TfR2 mRNA was high in normal CD34(+) erythroid precursor cells, and levels decreased during erythroid differentiation in vitro. Levels of expression of TfR2-alpha mRNA were significantly higher in erythroleukemia (M6) marrow samples than in nonmalignant control marrow samples. In addition, relatively higher levels of TfR2-alpha mRNA expression occurred in some samples of myelodysplastic syndrome that had erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow, acute myelogenous leukemia M1, M2, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression profiles of normal members of the erythroid lineage suggest that TfR2-alpha may be a useful marker of early erythroid precursor cells. The clinical significance of TfR2-alpha expression in leukemia cells remains to be determined.
