Spinal cord compression caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis is a rare complication of chronic anemic states, most frequently occurring in patients with beta-thalassemia. We report the MR appearance of extramedullary hematopoiesis resulting in cord compression in a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, which was isointense with the spinal cord on T1-weighted images and markedly hypointense on fast spin-echo T2-weighted images, and that demonstrated enhancement.
