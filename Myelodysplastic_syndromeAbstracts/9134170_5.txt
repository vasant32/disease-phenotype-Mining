Thirty-five patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were treated with BMT between 1986 and 1994. Their median age was 41 years (range 23-60). Thirteen patients had transfusion-dependent refractory anaemia (RA). Twenty-two patients suffered from more advanced stages of MDS, 15 being in complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy. In 31 recipients, pretransplant conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide and TBI with or without the addition of idarubucin; four patients were conditioned with other schedules. Donors were genotypically HLA-identical and MLC-negative siblings in 32, and others in three cases. All patients received a graft depleted of 98% of T lymphocytes using counterflow centrifugation. Fourteen patients are alive and in continuous remission with a median follow-up of 20 months (range 15-113) after BMT. Seven patients relapsed between 3 and 18 months after BMT and subsequently died. Fourteen transplantation-related deaths occurred. Outcome in patients under and over 40 years old was comparable. The probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years after BMT was 39% (95% confidence interval (CI), 22-56%). Considering patients with HLA-identical and MLC-negative sibling donors transplanted for RA (n = 11) or more advanced stages of MDS in CR (n = 14), the probabilities of DFS were 73% (95% CI, 47-99%) and 42% (95% CI, 15-69%), respectively. This indicates that BMT with lymphocyte-depleted grafts can cure a substantial number of relatively old patients with MDS, especially when grafts from HLA-identical and MLC-negative siblings are used and patients are suffering from RA.
