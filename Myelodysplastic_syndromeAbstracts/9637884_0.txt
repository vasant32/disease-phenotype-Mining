Cytarabune ocfosfate (SPAC) is rapidly transformed into cytarabine (ara-C) when orally administered. The pharmacokinetics of SPAC was studied in six patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and/or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after oral administration of SPAC at 100 to 400 mg/day for 14 days. Plasma ara-C concentrations reached a plateau in 48 to 96 hours after initiation of SPAC administration, remained at this or a little higher level until one day after its termination and were less than 1 ng/ml 8 days after the termination. From all of pharmacokinetic data, the oral administration of SPAC at 150 to 300 mg/m2/day was pharmacokinetically concluded to be comparable to the continuous infusion of ara-C at 20 mg/m2/day. All of the patients could receive SPAC for 14 days. SPAC is considered to be useful for consolidation or maintenance chemotherapy of ANLL or MDS outpatients who are unable to undergo intensive chemotherapy.
