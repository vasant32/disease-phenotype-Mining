The inclusion of cytogenetic studies in the protocol study of patients with hematological malignant diseases is a very important contribution because these results contribute to establish better precision of diagnosis, prognostic and suggest adequate therapeutic management precociously. The Karyotypes of 200 patients between ages of 2 and 84 years, 56/200 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 55/200 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 63/200 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 20/200 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 6/200 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, (CLL), are analyzed. Certain differences were noted. In ALL, hyperdiploidy was the chromosomal abnormality more frequently observed and no cases of Ph+ chromosome were reported; with respect to AML, the autosomal monosomy and trisomy were the most frequent findings. MDS reports only one case with 5q deletion, 10% of patients presented trisomy 14, rarely reported. CML do no report any case with double Ph+ and only one case with i(17q); nevertheless, one case with 21q deletion was found, which is an unreported anomaly. CLL did not present any case with trisomy 12. These findings are discussed in the context of geographical heterogeneity of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemia, and emphasize the importance of continued epidemiological studies.
