Monitoring of WT1 expression in PB and CD34(+) donor chimerism of BM predicts early relapse in AML and MDS patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning. Leukemia 25, 498-505 (2011). Early detection of relapse is critical for patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), since therapy can be initiated while disease burden remains low. As these neoplasms represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies with distinct underlying mutations, no single genetic marker exists that both defines AML/MDS and can be exploited for sensitive detection of neoplastic cells prior to overt hematologic relapse. Conversely, the Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) expression level is increased in blasts of most AML/MDS patients, and quantitative analysis of WT1 expression has been used to predict relapse following myeloablative HSCT. In this article, we review a recently published study evaluating the usefulness of multiple markers, including WT1 expression, for predicting relapse in AML/MDS patients following reduced-intensity conditioning nonmyeloablative HSCT.
