A patient with a 17-month history of myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess blasts that evolved into chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), which was treated with transfusions and erythropoietin, developed abdominal and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsies of the abdominal nodes revealed virtual obliteration of the architecture by myeloid blasts admixed with maturing granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic precursors. The lymph node findings appeared to represent extramedullary dyshematopoiesis undergoing a tissue phase blast transformation. Four months later, the patient developed rising peripheral blast counts consistent with acute leukemia. Although the development of granulocytic sarcoma (also called extramedullary myeloid cell tumor) is well known to occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, to our knowledge this is the first description of an extramedullary myeloid cell tumor associated with trilineage differentiation.
