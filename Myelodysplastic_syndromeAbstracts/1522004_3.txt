Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of 252Th dioxide, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for more than 25 y after its clinical practice introduction in 1930. Its excellence as a contrast medium was ultimately eclipsed by its long-term associated morbidities, and its use essentially ended by 1954. This case history presents the clinical events in the last 10 y of life in a patient injected with Thorotrast in 1953. This patient developed three previously described Thorotrast-associated morbidities: pneumococcus sepsis due to functional asplenia and reticuloendothelial system blockade, an enlarging Thorotrastoma (inflammatory mass) at the injection site, and a fatal blood dyscrasia. In addition, she developed three clinical syndromes where a Thorotrast association may exist. She suffered from severe spinal column osteoarthritis and vertebral collapse. An abnormal bone-density measurement implies the presence of radiodense radioactive thorium or its degradation products as potentially responsible. She had evidence of chronic immune system disregulation with immunoglobulin excess, auto antibodies, and cell-mediated immunity deficiency. This condition is similar to that found in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may suggest a shared etiology in reticuloendothelial system damage. Lastly, she developed dense bilateral cataracts. This case history illustrates the temporal relationship of a variety of symptoms. Discussion is directed at review of previous data and support for new associations.
