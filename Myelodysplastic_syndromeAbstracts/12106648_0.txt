Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosome instability syndrome, characterized by progressive pancytopenia and cancer susceptibility. Other cellular features of FA cells are hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and accelerated telomere shortening. We have quantified overall genome chromosome fragility and euploidy as well as chromosomes 7 and 8 aneuploidy in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a group of FA patients and age-matched controls that were previously measured for telomere length. The haematology of FA samples were also characterized in terms of whole blood cell, neuthrophil and platelet counts, transfusion dependency, requirement of androgens, cortico-steroids or bone marrow transplantation, and the development of bone marrow clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. As expected, a high frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks was observed in FA patients, especially of chromatid-type. No differences in chromosomes 7 and 8 monosomy, polysomy and non-disjunction were detected between FA patients and controls. The same was true for overall genome haploidy or polyploidy. Interestingly, the spontaneous levels of chromosome fragility but not of numerical abnormalities were correlated to the severity of the haematological disease in FA. None of the variables included in the present investigation (chromosome fragility, chromosome numerical abnormalities and haematological status) were correlated to telomere length.
