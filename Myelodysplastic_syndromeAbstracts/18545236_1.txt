Myeloablative conditioning continues to be employed in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among patients with pediatric transplant indications. Fractionated TBI (fTBI) remains, with its considerable anti-leukemic potential, the cornerstone of conditioning in the most common of pediatric indications, ALL in its first, second or subsequent remission despite its well-established long-term sequelae. The feasibility of chemotherapy-only regimens has been established and these regimens widely employed in other pediatric indications, for example, in ALL below the age of 2 years, AML, myelodysplasias or severe aplastic anemia. Conditioning regimens are being modified with data accumulating on the role of, for example, pre-transplant residual disease, advanced HLA-typing or haploidentical transplantations in the pediatric setting.
