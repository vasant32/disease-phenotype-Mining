We report on characteristics of the first human cell line, PC-MDS, derived from a bone marrow of a patient with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) who had no overt post-MDS leukemia. Classic cytology analyses, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular genetic procedures were used for characterization of the cell line. PC-MDS cells are positive for the expression of CD13, CD15, CD30, CD33, and CD45 antigen. Positive cytochemical staining and immunophenotype analyses indicated that PC-MDS cells have some characteristics of the early myeloid precursor cell. The karyotype analysis of PC-MDS cell line revealed various numerical and structural changes including those typically associated with t-MDS: del(5)(q13)[7], der(5)t(5;11)(p11;q11)[13], -7[6], del(7)(q31)[2], +20[3], -20[4]. Evaluation of methylation status in a promoter region of p15, p16 and MGMT genes showed biallelic hypermethylation pattern of 5' promoter region only in MGMT gene. PC-MDS is the first t-MDS derived cell line, and based on its immunological, cytogenetic and molecular characterization could be a new tool in evaluation of complex biology of MDS and a model for methylation studies.
