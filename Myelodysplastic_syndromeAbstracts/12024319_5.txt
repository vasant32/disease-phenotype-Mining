Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of acquired primary and secondary alterations of hematopoietic stem cells that result in cytopenias in blood and cytologic features of dysplasia in blood and/or bone marrow. To better understand the cytologic features that would permit differentiation of primary and secondary forms of myelodysplasia, we reviewed 267 consecutive bone marrow reports from dogs. These reports indicated that 34 dogs (12.7%) had dysgranulopoiesis, dyserythropoiesis, and/or dysthrombopoiesis in >10% of granulopoietic cells, erythroid cells, and/or megakaryocytes, respectively. Thirteen dogs had primary myelodysplastic syndromes, and 21 had secondary myelodysplastic syndromes. Of the 13 dogs with primary myelodysplasia, 4 were subclassified as myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia (MDS-RA), and 9 were subclassified as myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts (MDS-EB). Secondary conditions associated with dysplasia in the bone marrow included malignant lymphoma (n = 5), myelofibrosis (n = 3), immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (n = 4), immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (n = 5), multiple myeloma with melphalan administration (n = 1), pyometra with estrogen administration (n = 1), polycythemia vera (n = 1), and thrombopathia (n = 1). MDS-RA was characterized by <5% myeloblasts in bone marrow, normal granulocyte maturation ratio, increased erythroid maturation ratio, and dysplastic changes in >15% of erythroid cells. MSD-EB was characterized by >/=5% myeloblasts in bone marrow, high granulocyte maturation and erythroid maturation ratios, >/=32% dysplastic granulocytes, and the presence of small atypical immature myeloid cells. Secondary myelodysplastic syndromes were characterized by <5% myeloblasts in bone marrow, variable granulocyte maturation and erythroid maturation ratios, and variable dysplastic features. These results indicate that morphology alone cannot be used to distinguish primary and secondary myelodysplastic syndromes in dogs.
