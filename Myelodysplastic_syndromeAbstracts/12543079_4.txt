5-azacytidine (AZA) yields hematologic improvement in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Ineffective hemopoiesis in MDS produce the paradox of high intramedullary cellularity with peripheral cytopenias. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-11 regulate hemopoiesis and LIF, OSM, and IL-6 also inhibit the proliferation of myeloid leukemic cell lines through the signal-transducing subunit gp130. These IL-6-type cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell culture supernatants (SN) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) and monocyte-depleted MNC of patients with refractory anemia (RA; n=12) and healthy individuals (n=10). AZA down-regulated OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 release by MNC of patients but not by MNC from healthy individuals. Patient's SN had significantly lower concentrations of LIF, OSM, and IL-11 than SN of normal subjects. When monocyte-depleted MNC of patients were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin a significant increment in OSM levels was observed. In contrast, monocyte depletion in healthy subjects did not cause any significant change in OSM values. We conclude that: (a) AZA inhibits the release of OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 exclusively in RA-diseased MNC, (b) Patient's MNC release subnormal amounts of LIF, OSM, and IL-11, and (c) RA-derived monocytes probably down-regulate OSM release by phytohemagglutinin-activated MNC.
