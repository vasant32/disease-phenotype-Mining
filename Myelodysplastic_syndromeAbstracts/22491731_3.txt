 BACKGROUND: We report a prospective multicenter phase II study of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using CD3/CD19-depleted grafts after reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan and OKT-3. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-one adults with a median age of 46 years (range 19-65 years) have been enrolled. Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (n=38), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=8), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=6), myeloma (n=4), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=3), chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=1) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1). Patients were considered high risk because of refractory disease (n=18), cytogenetics (n=6), complete remission (≥ 2) (n=9), chemosensitive relapse in partial remission (n=4) or relapse after prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=15 allogeneic, n=8 autologous, n=1 both). At haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 30 patients were in complete remission and 31 in partial remission. Grafts contained a median of 7.0 × 10(6) (range 3.2-22) CD34(+) cells/kg, 4.2 × 10(4) (range 0.6-44) CD3(+) T cells/kg and 2.7 × 10(7) (range 0.00-37.3) CD56(+) cells/kg. RESULTS: Engraftment was rapid with a median of 12 days to granulocytes more than 0.5 × 10(9)/L (range 9-50 days) and 11 days to platelets more than 20 × 10(9) (range 7-38 days). Incidence of grade IIIV acute graft-versus-host-disease and chronic graft-versus-host-disease was 46% and 18%, respectively. Non-relapse mortality on Day 100 was 23% and 42% at two years. Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at two years was 31%. Kaplan-Meier estimated 1-year and 2-year overall survival with median follow up of 869 days (range 181-1932) is 41% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen allows successful haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning in high-risk patients lacking a suitable donor.
