The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents a group of clonal hematological disorders characterized by progressive cytopenia reflecting defects in erythroid, myeloid and mega karyocytic maturation. The incidence of MDS is greter in older age groups. Detailed studies on MDS from India are not available. Cytogenetic study using GTG-banding and FISH revealed 54.5% clonal chromosomal abnormalities. We have carried out chromosomal breakage study from peripheral blood cultures induced with mitomycin C, in karyotypically normal MDS (49) and 15 (30.6%) showed significant (p < 0.001) increase in chromosome damage compared to controls. Among 22 occupationally exposed MDS, 6 (27.3%) showed a high frequency of chromosome breakage while in the non-exposure (n=27) group, high chromosome breakage was noted in 9 (33.3% ) MDS patients. Our results suggest that the high chromosome damage may be due to acquired Fanconi anemia which leads to multiple defects in chromosomes and clonal chromosome anomalies.
