Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) improves anaemia in approximately 20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We investigated the potential advantage of a prolonged administration of rHuEpo to achieve higher erythroid response rates (RR) in 281 MDS patients: 118 with refractory anaemia (RA), 77 with refractory anaemia and ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 59 with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and blast count < 10% (RAEB-I), and 27 with RAEB and blast count between 11-20% (RAEB-II). rHuEpo was given subcutaneously at a dose of 150 U/kg thrice weekly, for a minimum of 26 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated after 12 and 26 weeks of therapy. The overall RR was 45.1%; the RR for RA, RARS, RAEB-I and RAEB-II were 48.3%, 58.4%, 33.8% and 13% respectively. A significant increase in RR was observed at week 26 in RA, RARS and RAEB-I patients, as the response probability increased with treatment duration. The RR was higher in the good cytogenetic prognostic group and serum Epo level of > 150 U/l at baseline predicted for non-response. The median duration of response was 68 weeks and the overall risk of leukaemic transformation was 21.7%. These results suggest that prolonged administration of rHuEpo produces high and long-lasting erythroid RR in MDS patients with low blast counts, particularly in those with pretreatment serum Epo levels of < 150 U/l and good cytogenetic prognosis.
