One hundred and one patients with refractory cytopenia were reviewed for morphological classification (using bone marrow, BM, imprints for cytology and Jamshidi biopsies for BM cellularity) and clinical course. Final diagnoses were: moderate aplastic anemia (MAA), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and hypoplastic acute leukemia (HAL). Ninety-two patients received high dose testosterone enanthate (TE) as first treatment (starting dose = 7-10 mg/week i.m. for at least three months). Median survival was significantly longer in MAA than in MDS and in HAL. Among MDS patients, those with primary acquired sideroblastic (AISA) and refractory (RA) anemia had median survival similar to those with MAA, but distinctly longer (p = 0.01) than patients with RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBtr) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Acute leukemia (AL) developed more rarely (p less than 0.02) in MAA, AISA and RA than in RAEB, RAEBtr and CMMoL. Response to TE was seen in about two thirds of MAA and in a half of MDS and HAL patients. Among MDS patients, those with hypocellular BM developed leukemia less frequently, responded to androgens more often and survived longer than those with normocellular and, especially, with hypercellular BM. These data indicate that the cytohistological classification of refractory cytopenias identifies essentially two groups with different clinical behaviour, one (MAA, AISA and RA) having long life expectancy and a low probability of developing AL and the other (RAEB, RAEBtr, CMMoL) with a short survival and relatively frequent leukemic complication. Bone marrow hypocellularity seems to be a favourable prognostic factor in MDS. Patients with refractory cytopenias, especially those with a hypocellular BM, can be advantageously treated with androgens.
