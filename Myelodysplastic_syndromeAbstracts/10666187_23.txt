This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of therapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) in anemic, neutropenic patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Sixty-six patients were enrolled according to the following French-American-British classification: refractory anemia (20), refractory anemia with excess blasts (35), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (9), and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (2). Patients were stratified by their serum erythropoietin levels (less than or equal to 500 mU/mL, n = 37; greater than 500 mU/mL, n = 29) and randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to either GM-CSF (0.3-5.0 microg/kg.d) + epoetin alfa (150 IU/kg 3 times/wk) or GM-CSF (0.3-5.0 microg/kg.d) + placebo (3 times/wk). The mean neutrophil count rose from 948 to 3831 during treatment with GM-CSF +/- epoetin alfa. Hemoglobin response (increase greater than or equal to 2 g/dL, unrelated to transfusion) occurred in 4 of 45 (9%) patients in the GM-CSF + epoetin alfa group compared with 1 of 21 (5%) patients with GM-CSF + placebo group (P = NS). Percentages of patients in the epoetin alfa and the placebo groups requiring transfusions of red blood cells were 60% and 92%, respectively, for the low-endogenous erythropoietin patients and 95% and 89% for the high-endogenous erythropoietin patients (P = NS). Similarly, the average numbers of units of red blood cells transfused during the 12-week study in the epoetin alfa and the placebo groups were 5.9 and 9.5, respectively, in the low-endogenous erythropoietin patients and 9.7 and 8.6 in the high-endogenous erythropoietin patients (P = NS). GM-CSF +/- epoetin alfa had no effect on mean platelet count. Treatment was well tolerated in most patients, though 10 withdrew from the study for reasons related predominantly to GM-CSF toxicity.
