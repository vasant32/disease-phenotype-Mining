The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of t(11;16)(q23;p13) to the type of myeloproliferative disorder noted by hematopathology. Previously, t(11;16) has been reported in fewer than 20 patients, all with the diagnosis of therapy-related (secondary) acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Putative involved genes are the MLL on 11q23 and CBP at 16p13. Data from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) Cytogenetics Laboratory revealed 3 patients with t(11;16) observed during the past 5 years. Two of the patients had a prior diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and had been treated with chemotherapy, which included cyclophosphamide. The other patient presented with de novo AML and no history of cancer or chemotherapy. Two of the 3 patients had t(11;16) as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. One patient had a t(11;16) clone that included t(9;21) and t(10;21) as additional changes. Translocation (11;16) has previously been reported only as being therapy-related. In this study, the t(11;16) was seen in 2 patients with previous lymphomas treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). A single patient with apparently de novo AML constitutes the first reported instance of non-treatment associated t(11;16) AML.
