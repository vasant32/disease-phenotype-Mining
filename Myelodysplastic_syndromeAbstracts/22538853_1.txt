The presence of ≥ 15% bone marrow (BM) ring sideroblasts (RS) and < 5% blasts is required for a diagnosis of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts. We examined the phenotypic and prognostic relevance of this "15%" RS threshold in 200 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without excess blasts and with ≥ 1% RS. The impact of RS% was assessed both as a continuous and categorical variable: < 5% (n = 56), 5%-14% (n = 32), 15%-50% (n = 79), and > 50% (n = 33). RS% correlated (P < .05) directly with age, platelet count, transfusion dependency, BM cellularity, and mutant SF3B1 and inversely with hemoglobin level, multilineage dysplasia, and high-risk karyotype; but did not correlate with IDH mutations. At a median follow-up of 33 months, 156 (73%) deaths and 24 (12%) leukemic transformations were documented. Neither univariate nor multivariable analysis showed significant effect for RS% on overall or leukemia-free survival, suggesting the limited prognostic value of quantifying BM RS in MDS.
