A case of ANLL following a myelodysplastic syndrome, probably resulting from occupational exposure to ionizing irradiation, with two cytogenetically unrelated clones, hexasomy 8 and trisomy 11, was investigated by conventional cytogenetics and FISH. Significant quantitative differences between data obtained by metaphase and interphase analysis of the hexasomy 8 clone were observed. A difference in the sensitivity to chemotherapy of the two clones was found: while the hexasomy 8 clone markedly decreased in response to treatment, the trisomy 11 clone remained unchanged.
