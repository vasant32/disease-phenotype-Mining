Myleodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are pre-malignant hematopoietic diseases that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression in conjunction with changes in immune function. In this model of leukemia evolution, the expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributes to immune escape. Here, we discuss the importance of Treg-memory phenotype switching as a poor prognostic indicator in MDS.
