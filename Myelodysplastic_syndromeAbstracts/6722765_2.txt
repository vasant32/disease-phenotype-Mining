The gene for erythrocyte glutathione reductase (E-GR) activity has been assigned to chromosome #8. In the present series, we examined the E-GR activity in 14 cases with chronic myelodysplastic syndrome (CMS, preleukemia), atypical acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), with and without acquired trisomy #8. No difference in the incidence of high levels of this enzyme was found between two groups, i.e., those with and without trisomy #8 suggesting the existence of a complex regulatory system in addition to chromosome #8.
