Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a stem cell disorder characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis and blood cytopenias. The present study investigated the potential of bone marrow CD34(+) progenitors in MDS patients to proliferate and differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) in a cytokine-supplemented liquid culture system and analysed the status of blood DC subsets in these patients. CD34(+) progenitors had low potential to generate DCs in vitro, as the number of DCs obtained from one CD34(+) cell was significantly lower compared with controls (median value 0.2 vs. 4, P = 0.003). In patients, the survival and proliferation of CD34(+) cells in culture was not correlated to the degree of apoptosis. Phenotypically and functionally CD34(+)-derived DCs were similar in MDS patients and normal subjects. The percentage of both circulating DC subsets in patients was extremely diminished compared with controls (myeloid DC: 0.10 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.35 +/- 0.13%, P < 0.001; plasmacytoid DC: 0.11 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.37 +/- 0.14%, P < 0.001). In cases with the 5q deletion both CD34-derived DCs and blood DCs harboured the cytogenetic abnormality. Our results indicate that, in MDS, the production of DCs is affected by the neoplastic process resulting in ineffective 'dendritopoiesis' with low blood DC precursor numbers. This quantitative DC defect probably contributes to the poor immune response against infectious agents and to the escape of the malignant clone from immune recognition with disease progression towards acute leukaemia.
