In a retrospective study of 352 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes, 61 (17.3%) revealed myelofibrosis in bone marrow biopsies. The fibrosis was observed to occur mostly focally (41/61 cases), and collagen deposits were found very rarely (4/61). The histopathology of bone marrow biopsies revealed hyperplasia and disturbed differentiation in megakaryopoiesis; the frequency and grade of dysplasia in megakaryopoiesis increased with advancing myelofibrosis. Reticulin fibrosis occurred in all subtypes of MDS; however, there was a higher incidence in chronic myelo-monocytic leukaemia (CMMoL). The frequency of cytogenetic aberrations was significantly higher in the MDS cases with myelofibrosis, compared to the cases without fibrosis. Clinical data showed significantly lower values of haemoglobin and lower platelet counts in MDS with myelofibrosis. Life expectancy was reduced to 9.6 months, compared with 17.4 months in MDS without fibrosis. In refractory anaemia, the survival times were 10.0 months in MDS with myelofibrosis, compared to 28.9 months in MDS without myelofibrosis. 36.6% of the patients with MDS and myelofibrosis developed a transformation into ANLL during the course of the disease. Myelofibrosis therefore seems to herald a poor prognosis.
