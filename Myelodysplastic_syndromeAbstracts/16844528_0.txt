Mastocytosis refers to a group of disorders characterized by the pathologic proliferation of mast cells. We present a 70-year-old white man with a rare presentation of nodular mastocytosis, characterized by disseminated nodular lesions, myelodysplastic syndrome, and a c-kit V560G receptor mutation. The patient presented to the clinic after initial presentation 6 months earlier, with ear pruritus, associated hearing loss, and widespread rash.
