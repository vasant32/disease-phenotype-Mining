We studied spontaneous cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 14 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and 28 various myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cultured PBMC were measured by ELISA. The average levels of these cytokines were higher in AA or in refractory anemia (RA) than in RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) or in RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). Marked cytokine overproduction was observed in RA as well as in AA. High cytokine levels were observed in hypocellularity and low blast cell counts in the bone marrow. These results may suggest that the increase of cytokines may be a reactive response in hypocellular bone marrow.
