To investigate the chromosome-8 aberrations in myeloid malignancies with complex chromosome abnormalities (CCAs), 81 cases of myeloid malignancies with CCAs were analysed by conventional chromosome analysis and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization. The 81 cases included 25 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 35 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 21 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The results showed that all chromosomes were involved in CCAs, and the incidence of chromosome-8 abnormality was 35.8% (29 out of 81 cases) in myeloid malignancies with CCAs, which in AML, CML and MDS patients were 56% (14/25), 28.6% (10/35) and 23.81% (5/21), respectively. In CML, the incidences of accelerated phase and blast phase were 20% (1/5) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively. The most common aberrations involving chromosome 8 were unbalanced translocations (19 out of 29 cases, 51.7%). In conclusion, aberrations of chromosome 8 were common in myeloid malignancies with CCAs, and may be related to progression of the disease. The most common aberrations were unbalanced translocations.
