An understanding of anorectal lesions during hemopathy is of value since this disorder can be difficult to identify and treat. The authors report three cases of anorectal lesions during hemopathy. The following points emerged from this study, and from literature data: hemopathic disorders should be born in mind in cases of acute anal syndromes; the relative frequency of acute leukemia of specific lesions: nodules, in patches or aspecific: purpura, hematoma, fissures, ulceration, ulcers; marked neutropenia in leukemia and agranulocytosis; severity of anal surgery, which should be prudent. Atypical anal lesions may indicate hemopathy. They may respond favorably to medical treatment; prognostic severity of these lesions, especially if ulcerous and necrotic.
