Transfusion-induced iron overload is a frequent problem that clinicians have to face in the treatment of patients affected by both myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Different options are currently available for chelation therapy, e.g. oral once-daily administration of the iron chelator deferasirox. In 3 patients with MDS and 1 patient with PMF, deferasirox therapy resulted in an improvement in the hemoglobin level and a reduction in transfusion dependence. Our data open new insights regarding the benefit of iron chelation therapy not only for transfusional iron overload of myelodysplastic and myelofibrotic patients but also for the increase in hemoglobin levels. The biological mechanism of action of deferasirox, an effect which is not shared by other iron chelators, is still obscure and requires further investigations.
