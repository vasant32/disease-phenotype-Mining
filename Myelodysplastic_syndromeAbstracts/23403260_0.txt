The p15Ink4b gene is frequently hypermethylated in myeloid neoplasia and has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor. Since it is a member of the INK4b family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, it was initially presumed that its loss in leukemic blasts caused a dysregulation of the cell cycle. However, animal model experiments over the last several years have produced a very different picture of how p15Ink4b functions in hematopoietic cells and how its loss contributes to myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemia. It is clear now, that in early hematopoietic progenitors, p15Ink4b functions outside of its canonical role as a cell cycle inhibitor. Its functions are involved in signal transduction and influence the development of erythroid, monocytic and dendritic cells.
