Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic disorders which begin in a pluripotential bone marrow (BM) stem cell. This early stem cell is believed to acquire a growth advantage over its neighbors as a result of an initial transforming event, the nature of which has remained obscure. In this paper, we propose that pathogens such as those belonging to the herpesvirus family of DNA viruses may play a role in the initial transformation of the stem cell. The case for cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a representative of this family of viruses is discussed at length and a molecular mechanism which may be involved in the oncogenic activity of CMV is proposed. No proof has been presented to implicate CMV directly in MDS, but circumstantial evidence which supports such a possibility is provided.
