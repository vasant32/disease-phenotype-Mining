We studied the ability of stromal sublayer of long-term bone marrow cultures and peripheral blood macrophages from patients with various forms of myelodysplastic syndrome to maintain the growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units in mixed cultures. There were changes in the hemopoietic microenvironment in these patients: decreased cellularity of the bone marrow and impaired formation of sublayers in long-term bone marrow cultures, production of growth factors, maintaining the growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage precursors by stromal cells. Dysfunction of macrophages in the stromal microenvironment was probably related to the presence of pathological macrophages./Abstract>
