Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders. Metaphase cytogenetics has been the gold standard for genetic testing in MDS, but it detects clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in only 50% of cases. New karyotyping tests include FISH, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. These techniques have increased the detected genetic abnormalities in MDS, many of which confer prognostic significance to overall and leukemia-free survival. This has eventually increased our understanding of MDS genetics. With the help of new technologies, we anticipate that the existing prognostic scoring systems will incorporate mutational data into their parameters. This review discusses the progress in MDS diagnosis through the use of array-based technologies. The authors also discuss the recently investigated genetic mutations in MDS and revisit the MDS classification and prognostic scoring systems.
