Erythroleukemia was observed in two unrelated cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) from the same household. Case 1, a 1-year-old neutered male cat developed erythroleukemia (M6) after a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-Er) on the criteria of FAB classification of acute leukemias. Case 2, a 1-year-old neutered female cat, which had close contact with Case 1, also developed erythroleukemia (M6Er). In both cases, marked proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells with disproportionally large numbers of immature forms was observed in the bone marrow. In Case 1, neoplastic proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow was also noted at the terminal stage. Combination chemotherapy with daunomycin was partially effective for treatment of these erythroid neoplasias, but did not induce complete remission. Southern blot analysis using exogenous FeLV-specific probes indicated the clonal origin of these hematopoietic tumor cells. Furthermore, the erythroid and myeloid tumor cells in Case 1 were shown to be derived from independent transformed clones. A variant FeLV was shown to be integrated into the tumor cells in Case 1, while a full-length FeLV was found in both cases. Because these erythroid neoplastic diseases occurred in two unrelated cats kept in the same household and these diseases are rare, they may both have been associated with the same FeLV strain.
