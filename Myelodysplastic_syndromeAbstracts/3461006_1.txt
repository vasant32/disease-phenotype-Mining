A 55 year old woman developed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) one year after she had been successfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). When the ALL relapsed the CMML remitted only to return with further remission of the ALL. A consistent chromosomal abnormality, t(4;11), was present during both CMML and ALL phases.
