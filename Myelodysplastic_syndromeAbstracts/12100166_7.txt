It is still difficult to identify a potential stem cell in the bone marrow which can give rise to haematopoiesis and mesenchymal cells. In the past, the stem cells for both tissues were considered to be from different stem cell pools, but it has been shown recently in vitro and in vivo that there is an unexpected plasticity at least among early haemopoietic progenitors which can give rise also to mesenchymal tissue. In an attempt to identify stem cells in the bone marrow, which are common precursors to both lineages, we observed that fibroblast-like periosteal cells changed their morphology towards an osteoblastic differentiation with a more cuboidal or triangular morphology especially close to metastatic infiltrates. As a marker for haemopoietic progenitors, we used an antibody against the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (CD117) and an anti-osteocalcin antibody to stain mesenchymal cells with a osteoblastic potential. Normal bone marrow specimens only showed a discrete expression pattern of CD117 and osteocalcin, but periosteal stem cells, which strongly co-express the applied haemopoietic and mesenchymal markers, were found particularly in the bone marrow of patients with infiltrates of malignant lymphoma or metastasis from prostate or breast cancer. The evaluation of bone marrow specimens from patients with an aplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome showed a more heterogenous expression pattern. Our results show that a stem cell candidate common to haematopoiesis and mesenchymal progeny can be detected in bone marrow specimens after activation, as demonstrated by the co-expression of CD117 and osteocalcin, which also seems to be associated with haematological diseases or metastatic infiltration in the bone marrow.
