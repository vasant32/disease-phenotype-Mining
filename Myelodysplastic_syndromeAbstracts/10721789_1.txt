We report the clinical, hematologic, and cytogenetic findings for a child with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after treatment for a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. At the time of conversion to MDS, conventional cytogenetics revealed an unbalanced der(6)t(1;6) that resulted in trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1 and partial monosomy and duplication of 6p. Using alpha satellite probes, fluorescence in situ hybridization of bone marrow cells showed that the rearranged chromosome contained the centromeres of both chromosomes 1 and 6, thus forming a dic(1;6) resulting in trisomy 1q. This report is the first to describe a case of childhood secondary myelodysplastic syndrome associated with a trisomy 1q involving chromosome 6.
