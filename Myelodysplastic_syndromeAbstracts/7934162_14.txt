Mouse Tec is a non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase and is highly expressed in many hematopoietic cell lines. To investigate the roles of the Tec kinase in the human hematopoietic system, we isolated cDNAs encoding the human Tec kinase. The human tec cDNAs can encode a peptide of 631 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73,624. The predicted human Tec protein is highly homologous to those of the members of the Tec family including mouse Tec type IV (94% homology), mouse Tsk/Itk (60%), and human Btk (57%). The homology between human Tec and other members of the Tec family can be observed not only in the Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and kinase domains, but also in the N-terminal unique domain. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the major transcripts of tec could be detected at 2.6 kb and 3.6 kb in a wide range of human hematopoietic cell lines including myeloid, B-, and T-cell lineages. Interestingly, high expression of the tec gene could be detected in all of the three patients examined with myelodysplastic syndrome. The human tec gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to chromosome 4p12.
