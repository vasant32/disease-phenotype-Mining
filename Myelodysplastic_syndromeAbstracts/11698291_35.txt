Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, binds to several cell-surface receptors with distinct functions (agonistic receptors 1 and 2 [TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2]; decoy receptors 3 and 4 [TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4]). Expression and function was characterized in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). While normal marrow showed negligible expression of TRAIL and receptors (except TRAIL-R3), TRAIL and all receptors were constitutively expressed in MDS marrow. Following TRAIL exposure, MDS marrow showed significant increases in apoptosis, whereas normal marrow, except for a subset of CD34+ precursors, did not (P =.012). Marrow from 21 patients with MDS was then propagated in long-term cultures in the presence or absence of TRAIL. While in advanced MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation [RAEB-T] and tAML [MDS transformed into AML]), colony numbers decreased in the presence of TRAIL (63.0% +/- 10.4% of untreated group [100%]), numbers increased in patients with RA or RAEB (160.2% +/- 90.5% of untreated group). TRAIL eliminated preferentially clonally abnormal cells as identified by chromosomal markers. Thus, TRAIL and receptor expression differed significantly between normal and MDS marrow, and TRAIL modulated in vitro hemopoiesis in MDS dependent upon disease stage but not, to a detectable extent, in normal marrow.
