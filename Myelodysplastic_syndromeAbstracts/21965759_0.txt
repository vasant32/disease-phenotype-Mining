Inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) is recognized as a distinctive entity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with recurrent genetic abnormalities of prognostic significance. It occurs in 1-2.5% of AML and is also observed in myelodysplastic syndromes and in the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The molecular consequence of the inv(3)/t(3;3) rearrangements is the juxtaposition of the ribophorin I (RPN1) gene (located in band 3q21) with the ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) gene (located in band 3q26.2). Following conventional cytogenetics to determine the karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a panel of bacterial artificial chromosome clones was used to map the breakpoints involved in 15 inv(3)/t(3;3). Inv(3) or t(3;3) was the sole karyotypic anomaly in 6 patients, while additional abnormalities were identified in the remaining 9 patients, including 4 with monosomy of chromosome7 (-7) or a deletion of its long arm (7q-). Breakpoints in band 3q21 were distributed in a 235 kb region centromeric to and including the RPN1 locus, while those in band 3q26.2 were scattered in a 900 kb region located on each side of and including the EVI1 locus. In contrast to most of the inversions and translocations associated with AML that lead to fusion genes, inv(3)/t(3;3) does not generate a chimeric gene, but rather induces gene overexpression. The wide dispersion of the breakpoints in bands 3q21 and 3q26 and the heterogeneity of the genomic consequences could explain why the mechanisms leading to leukemogenesis are still poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to further characterize these chromosomal abnormalities by FISH.
