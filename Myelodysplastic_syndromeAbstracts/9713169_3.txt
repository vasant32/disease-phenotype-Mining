A female patient received a renal transplantation from an unrelated cadaver donor, and five years later developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with immunological abnormalities. Chromosomal analysis showed trisomy 8 in bone marrow cells. FISH analysis indicated that trisomy 8 was present in 4% of CD19 + cells, suggesting that the MDS clone involved B lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction of the human androgen receptor gene indicated B cell clonality (54%) and granulocyte clonality (63%). There have been no previous reports of secondary MDS following renal transplantation in which the MDS clone involved the B cell lineage. The abnormal MDS B cell clone may have caused the immunological abnormalities.
