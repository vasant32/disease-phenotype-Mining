Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, relapsing neurodermatitis that is often resistant to standard therapies with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines. Thalidomide, while efficacious in treating recalcitrant cases of prurigo nodularis, causes significant toxicity. Thalidomide-induced peripheral neuropathy frequently results in drug discontinuation. Lenalidomide (Revlimid; Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ) is a derivative of thalidomide with less neurotoxicity approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes that has not been widely studied in dermatologic disorders. Here, we report a case of refractory prurigo nodularis effectively treated with lenalidomide. Given its favorable side-effect profile, lenalidomide may offer a superior alternative to thalidomide in the treatment of this condition.
