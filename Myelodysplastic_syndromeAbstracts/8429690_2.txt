To evaluate the clinical usefulness of interleukin 2 (IL-2) on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the serum IL-2 level, the effect of IL-2 on the proliferation of blasts, and the cell-mediated cytotoxic effect of IL-2 on blasts were examined in MDS patients. Of 18 patients, 2 patients had an increased serum IL-2 level. Although the proliferation of blasts in most cases, including the two patients having a high serum IL-2 level, was not stimulated by IL-2, the blasts of one case apparently proliferated in response to IL-2. It was also clearly shown that IL-2-stimulated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) showed cytotoxicity against MDS blasts, whereas the PBMNC of the advanced stages of MDS were usually defective in regard to this IL-2-dependent cytotoxicity. The therapeutic usefulness of IL-2 or lymphokine-activated killer cells for MDS was not established by the present study.
