 OBJECTIVE: To detect the abnormalities of differentiation and expression of membrane hemopoietic cytokine receptors on CD34+ bone marrow cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Forty-five newly diagnosed MDS cases from July 2008 to March 2010 in our hospital and 30 normal controls were enrolled. There were 17 low-risk and 28 high-risk patients. The CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38- bone marrow cells and the expressions of stem cell factor receptor (SCF-R), erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors (G-CSFR) and thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) on those cells were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mean percentage of CD34+ in karyocyte of MDS cases in high-risk patients [0.53% (0.10%-1.68%)] was significantly higher than that of control group [0.13% (0.08%-0.32%), P<0.01]. The mean percentages of CD34+CD38+ cells were significantly lower in low and high-risk groups (86.3%±8.5% and 82.6%±11.1%) than those in control group (92.3%±3.4%). And the percentage of CD34+CD38- cells was significantly higher in either low-risk or high-risk group (13.7%±8.5% and 17.4%±11.0%) than that in control group (7.7%±3.4%, both P<0.05). In control group, the mean percentage of antigen expression of EpoR was significantly lower in CD34+CD38+ cells than that in CD34+CD38- cells (18.7%±18.3% vs 63.6%±20.0%, P<0.01). The expressions of SCF-R, G-CSFR and TpoR were not significantly different between two cell populations. The expressions of EpoR on CD34+CD38+ cells of low and high-risk MDS groups [9.0% (1.4%-12.7%), 5.2% (1.1%-14.1%)] were significantly lower than those of control group [9.6% (5.1%-30.1%), both P<0.05]. The expressions of G-CSFR on CD34+CD38+ cells of low and high-risk MDS groups (29.8%±19.1%, 28.7%±21.1%) were significantly lower than those of control group (44.4%±23.4%, both P<0.05). The quantities of EpoR on CD34+CD38- cells of low and high-risk MDS groups (42.2%±21.9%, 25.7%±15.6%) were significantly lower than those of control group (63.6%±20.0%, both P<0.01). The expressions of TpoR on CD34+CD38- cells of low and high-risk MDS groups (5.4%±4.7%, 4.1%±4.0%) were significantly lower than those of control group (10.1%±8.3%, both P<0.05). The incidence of cytopenia with low expression rates of hemopoietic cytokine receptors on CD34+ cells was higher than that of MDS with high expression rates. CONCLUSION: The abnormalities of differentiation and membrane hemopoietic cytokine receptors expression of CD34+ bone marrow cells in MDS are associated with MDS cytopenia and may be useful for the diagnosis of MDS.
