Primary tracheal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is rare, with fewer than 30 cases reported to date. We review the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of 2 cases of tracheal NHL mimicking granulation tissue. The first patient was a 67-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome and Crohn's disease who had a recurring lesion of the proximal trachea causing significant airway obstruction. The second patient was a 47-year-old man with a history of multiple intubations who presented with dyspnea and stridor due to circumferential tracheal stenosis. In both cases, bronchoscopy revealed abundant granulation tissue, and the initial biopsy results indicated benign disease. However, after requests from the diagnostic team to rule out lymphoma, additional immunohistochemical stains and polymerase chain reaction testing confirmed NHL. Radiotherapy was initiated. The first patient responded well and remains disease-free after 4 years. The second patient died of airway obstruction due to severe distal tracheal stenosis. Recurrent granulation tissue should raise the suspicion of malignancy and prompt further tissue evaluation for evidence of lymphoma. Steroids for airway compromise may cause progression to mature stenosis as prednisone is used in the treatment of lymphoma. Localized disease involving the central airways may be treated successfully with limited chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
