Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous diseases. Patients with blast counts of more than 20% of nucleated bone marrow cells have a high risk of short survival. We treated six patients with refractory anemia with excess of blast in transformation (RAEBiT) with low dose cytosine arabinoside (LD Ara-C). We had one partial remission (PR), surviving 16 weeks and two complete remissions (CR), surviving 22 and 55+ months. Myelosuppression was dominant in all patients, but was not as serious as with conventional remission-induction treatments for leukemias. Bone marrow aplasia occurred in all responding patients, but a differentiation effect is possible too. Maintenance therapy with LD Ara-C may be important for the two long-lasting CR.
