Myelosarcoma (chloroma) is a rare primary condition in patients with either a myelodysplastic syndrome, or an acute or chronic leukemia. It is an extramedullary neoplasm which does not commonly present with changes in peripheral blood or bone marrow. The rarity and histomorphological similarity to malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma renders the diagnosis notoriously difficult. Due to its coincidental or secondary manifestation followed by myelogenous leukemia, this tumor needs to be seen as a primary systemic disease. We present a 40 year old man with myelosarcoma of the jejunum and discuss this entity and its therapeutic options.
