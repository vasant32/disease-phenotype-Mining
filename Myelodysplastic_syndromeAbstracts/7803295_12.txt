We looked for MDM2 gene amplification and over-expression by Southern and Northern blot analysis in 135 and 66 cases of haematological malignancies, including ALL, AML, CML in chronic phase, CLL, MDS, PLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and myeloma. No amplification of the gene was found. An over-expression of MDM2 RNA was seen in 9/66 (14%) patients tested, including 3/9 ALL, 3/24 AML, 2/4 myelomas, 1/1 PLL, but 0/2 CML, 0/2 NHL and 0/21 MDS. None of the patients over-expressing MDM2 had modifications of P53 gene transcript or p53 mutations. Most of the patients over-expressing MDM2 gene had poor prognostic features (including 'unfavourable' cytogenetic abnormalities), poor response to chemotherapy and short survival. Our findings suggest that over-expression of MDM2 is seen in a relatively small number of haematological malignancies, and is associated with poor prognosis.
