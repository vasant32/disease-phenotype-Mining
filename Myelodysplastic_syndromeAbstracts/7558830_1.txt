We present a 58-year-old patient with disseminated aspergillosis and metastatic panniculitis. He suffered from agranulocytosis and blastic transformation of a myelodysplastic syndrome. The skin lesion showed a single subcutaneous inflammatory nodule, which was clearly shown by histolog to be of embolic origin. This clinical presentation has not previously been described. Disseminated aspergillosis is found mainly in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients and the mortality is high. The present case demonstrates how histological examination together with skin biopsy culture can allow the diagnosis.
