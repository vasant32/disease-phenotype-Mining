Two familial cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are reported, one of whom had an abnormal karyotype of 45, XY, -7 (monosomy 7). Case 1 was a 60-year-old woman developed dizziness and nasal bleeding. She was treated with blood transfusion alone. About 11 months after diagnosis, she died of pneumonia. Case 2 was a 22 year-old man, who was the son of case 1, developed febrile disease because of recurrent skin and oral mucosa infections. He had a partial response to low-dose of cytarabine. Thirteen months after diagnosis, he died of severe pneumonia. Both cases were diagnosed as having refractory anemia with excess of blasts due to peripheral blood and bone marrow findings. Both patients had pancytopenia, erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow, marked dyserythropoiesis, recurrent infectious diseases and severe pneumonia that resulted in death. These symptoms resembled to those reported for monosomy 7 syndrome. Familial MDS with monosomy 7 is rarely reported. These cases are of interest to investigate hereditary factors of MDS.
