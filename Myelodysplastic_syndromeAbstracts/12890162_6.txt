Two proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF, originating from the same gene locus CDKN2A, use different promoters and alternative reading frames. p16INK4A is translated from alpha transcript and p14ARF is from beta transcript. These two proteins, which are inactivated in some human malignancies, are possible tumour suppressor candidates. In this study, we investigated the expression of p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs in haematological malignancies. We studied eight normal bone marrow samples, three reactive granulocytic hyperplasia patients, and 21 haematological malignancy patients, including seven acute myelogenous leukaemia, four acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, five myelodysplastic syndrome, five chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Normal bone marrows and reactive granulocytic hyperplasia showed barely detectable expression of either mRNA. In contrast, p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was abnormally increased in patients with haematological malignancies. Especially in CML, overexpression of p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs was more frequent than in controls (80 and 60%, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was frequently increased in haematological malignancies, especially in CML. We suggest that overexpression of these mRNAs may be related to the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies.
