Forty-three patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) received treatment with oral etoposide 50 mg/day for 21 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Eighteen patients (42%) experienced hematological responses, including 12 of 17 (70%) patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Three of five CMML patients who failed treatment with hydroxyurea experienced major hematological responses with oral etoposide. Median response duration exceeded 9 months (range: 4-49 + months), and one patient remains in an unmaintained complete remission for 4 years. Toxicity included nausea/vomiting in five patients, fever (four patients), infection (three patients), mucositis (two patients), and anorexia (two patients). Two patients had grade 4 neutropenia with sepsis necessitating treatment withdrawal. We conclude that low-dose oral etoposide has remitting activity in MDS and is an effective treatment alternative for patients with CMML.
