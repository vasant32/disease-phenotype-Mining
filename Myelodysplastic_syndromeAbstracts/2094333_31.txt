A long-term clinical trial of 1-15 months has been carried out with the oral iron chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1) in 13 transfusion-dependent iron-loaded patients. Urinary iron excretion was greatest in patients with thalassaemia major and was related to the number of previous transfusions but not to the serum ferritin level. Substantial increases of urinary iron were observed in all the patients when the frequency of the daily dose was doubled and in response to 2 x 3 g L1 daily 11 of 12 patients tested excreted greater than 25 mg iron daily, the mean daily intake of iron from transfusion. Serum ferritin levels have fluctuated but overall have remained unchanged. Pharmacological studies in five patients have indicated rapid absorption probably from the stomach and variable plasma half life of 77 +/- 35 min (X +/- SD). Glucuronation was identified as a major route of L1 metabolism. Short-term intensive chelation studies using repeated administration of L1 resulted in further increases of urinary iron excretion by comparison to a single dose. In one case 325 mg of iron were excreted in the urine following the administration of 16 g (5 x 2 g + 2 x 3 g) within 24 h. Iron excretion studies were carried out in six transfusional iron-loaded patients who were maintained on a low iron diet before and during chelation. No significant increases of faecal iron excretion were observed with L1 using daily doses of up to 3 x 3 g and 4 x 2 g. The high level of compliance during treatment with L1 and the levels of urine iron excretion that can be achieved increase the prospects for oral chelation in transfusional iron-loaded patients.
