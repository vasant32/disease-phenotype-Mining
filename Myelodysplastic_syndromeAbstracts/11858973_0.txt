The EORTC Leukemia Group comprises more than 45 qualified haematology centres in Europe. The group promotes cooperation with new centres from Central and Eastern Europe with the aim to improve the standard and quality to the level in Western Europe. Subcommittees on cytogenetics, molecular biology, and immunology, shared by experts in the field, are active and have meetings on a twice-yearly basis. The aim of our group is to organise phase II and phase III trials for patients with acute and chronic myeloid or lymphoid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloma. In 2000, 330 patients have been included in nine trials of the group. Presently, more than 2600 patients included in previous and current studies are alive and under continuous follow-up allowing studies on the long-term results to be planned.
