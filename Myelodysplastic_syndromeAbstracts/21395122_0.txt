Two FLT3-ITD mutations, one FLT3-TKD) and five NPM1 mutations were detected in 7 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) out of 44 cases of MDS and MDS/mixed myeloid diseases. Expression of one of the three investigated mutations was identified: 4 in gene NPM1 (9.1%) and 2--FLT3-ITD (4.5%); simultaneous FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation--1 (2.3%); no progression in NPM1 within 9-20 months--3, although with chromosome 7 damage--2. It was suggested that NPM1 mutation without complex karyotype may serve as marker of relatively favorable course.
