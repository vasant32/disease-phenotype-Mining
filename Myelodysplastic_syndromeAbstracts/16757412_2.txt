The ETV6 gene on 12p13 is involved in different hematologic malignancies through a variety of chromosomal translocations. Here we report the analysis of a t(10;12)(q24;p13) identified in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. Our results show that the t(10;12) results in the generation of an in-frame fusion between ETV6 and GOT1, a gene encoding a cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase enzyme. In addition, two other fusion transcripts involving exons from yet unidentified genes were detected, as well as expression of an uncharacterized gene from the 10q24 region. This work identifies GOT1 as a novel fusion partner of ETV6 in myelodysplastic syndrome.
