Musculoskeletal and central nervous system infections caused by Bacillus cereus are very rare. Only a few cases have been reported, whose clinical courses strongly suggested that surgical procedures combined with appropriate antimicrobial therapy are necessary to cure these infections. A 60-year-old man with severe neutropenia due to myelodysplastic syndrome, developing necrotizing fasciitis and brain abscess caused by Bacillus cereus is reported. Without performing any surgical procedures, the patient was successfully treated with systemic antimicrobial therapy combined with granulocyte colony stimulating factor, which contributed to the increase in the neutrophil count.
