We describe a rare case of acute myeloid leukaemia with trilineage myelodysplasia complicated by central diabetes insipidus. In the present case, diabetes insipidus was masked by corticosteroid deficiency due to hypopituitarism and clinical symptoms presented after administering methylprednisolone. Although the remission of leukaemia was not achieved by chemotherapy, excessive urinary output was well-controlled by nasal administration of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) during the course.
