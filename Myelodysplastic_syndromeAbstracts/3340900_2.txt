The relationship between mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count was evaluated in 259 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 311 patients with various haematological disorders. Platelet volume-number relationships determined in a previous study on normal subjects were used as a reference range. There was a significant inverse relationship between MPV and platelet count in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (r = -0.49; P less than 0.0001), which by interval analysis was shown to be non-linear. In the patients with haematological disorders, the platelets were found to be disproportionately small for number in patients with aplastic anaemia, chemotherapy-induced marrow suppression and some cases of acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In subjects with chronic ITP followed longitudinally, the inverse platelet volume-number relationship was retained. MPV was appropriate for platelet number in myelodysplastic syndromes, variable in iron deficiency anaemia and disproportionately large in myeloproliferative syndromes, most notably in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. The observation that the MPV was disproportionately large in comparison with the platelet count was used in establishing the diagnosis of an hereditary giant platelet syndrome in a family of British origin.
