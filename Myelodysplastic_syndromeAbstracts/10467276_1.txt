Monosomy 7 or partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 is frequently described in children with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloblastic leukemia. Parental origin of chromosome 7 in children with sporadic monosomy 7 has been examined very rarely. To investigate if monosomy 7 shows parent-of-origin, we have studied a female child with monosomy 7 and de novo myelodysplastic syndrome by a series of polymorphic polymerase chain reaction markers. We found loss of maternal allele and discussed the results with the previous reports.
