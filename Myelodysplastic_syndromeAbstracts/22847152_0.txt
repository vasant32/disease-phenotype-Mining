Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative approach for several diseases predominantly affecting elderly patients. Overall survival is compromised by treatment-related mortality (TRM), GvHD, and relapse. Pretransplant clinical risk indicators in elderly patients qualifying for HCT are highly desirable. Pro-BNP is known as a predictor of death in patients with an increasing variety of clinical conditions and frequently used as a routine parameter for organ complications in the allogeneic transplant setting without well-established scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP could aid in identifying elderly patients at risk for early mortality. We retrospectively evaluated NT-pro-BNP values in 177 consecutive patients of ≥60 years HCT (2005-2010). In 29.4 % of cases, NT-pro-BNP values were within our institute's normal range (<125 pg/ml). Analysis of different NT-pro-BNP cutoff points by receiver operating characteristics curve for mortality at day +100 revealed no single cutoff value with satisfying specificity and sensitivity. The individual outcome of patients with extremely high NT-pro-BNP values was not associated with an increase in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. NT-pro-BNP values of patients succumbing to TRM did not differ significantly from those alive or having died of relapse-median 276 vs. 217 pg/ml. In conclusion, pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP was of no convincing prognostic relevance for day 100 mortality.
