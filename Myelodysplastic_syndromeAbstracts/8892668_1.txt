Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a cytopenia related to abnormal proliferation and differentiation of marrow precursor cells. Some subtypes of MDS are associated with thrombocytemia or abnormal megakaryopoiesis and certain specific karyotypic abnormalities. We report on four cases of MDS with normal or elevated blood platelet count and a recurring abnormality in chromosome 1p34. The gene involved appears to be different from c-mpl and TPO.
