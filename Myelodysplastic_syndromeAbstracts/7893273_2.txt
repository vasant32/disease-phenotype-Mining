The oral iron chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1, deferiprone, CAS 30652-11-0) has been given daily for 3-11 months to 6 transfusion dependent iron loaded patients (myelodysplasia (MDS) 2, Diamond-Blackfan anaemia 1, thalassaemia intermedia 1, thalassaemia major 2). Daily doses of 3 g, 2 x 2 g and 3 x 2 g were administered for the first 2-7 months. Daily doses of 2 x 3 g were also used for periods up to 4 months. Urine iron excretion following 3 g of L1 was found to be related to the number of previous transfusions but not to serum ferritin or the amount of L1 excreted. In each case 24 h urinary iron excretion in response to 3 g L1 ranged from 5-21 mg in MDS, 13-25 mg in a thalassaemia intermedia and a Diamond-Blackfan patient and 16-110 mg in thalassaemia major patients. Further increases of urinary iron were observed in all the patients when the daily dose was increased. Serum ferritin levels have fluctuated but overall have remained unchanged. Biochemical assessment did not show any major abnormalities ascribed to L1 except from subnormal serum zinc levels in two patients and white blood cell absorbate in another. In a separate study we have compared urinary L1 and iron excretions in 7 transfusional iron loaded patients. In all the cases the concentration of L1 was in excess of iron and higher than the level required for 100% iron binding. There was no other apparent correlation between the concentrations of L1 and iron in the urines studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
