Hickman catheter site infections are known to increase transplant-related mortality (TRM). A retrospective analysis of 103 patients who received allogeneic SCT (stem cell transplants) was performed to define the incidence and outcomes of Hickman infections. Seventy-six patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (73.8%) and 29 patients (28.2%), nonmyeloablative conditioning. During the median follow-up of 9 months, Hickman infections were observed in 10 patients (9.7%) at a median onset of 32 days posttransplantation (range, 2-102 days). The causative organisms were identified in 5 cases, including Staphylococcus species (n=4) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Six events were successfully resolved with antibiotic treatment, whereas the other 4 events required the removal of the Hickman catheters with subsequent death in 2 cases. The survival duration for the Hickman infection group was shorter than that for the Hickman no infection group (83 days vs 366 days, respectively; P <.001). Myeloid engraftment was delayed in the Hickman infection group (18.0 days vs 15.0 days, respectively; P=.038), plus Hickman infections were more frequent among BMT compared with PBSCT group (22.2% vs 5.3%, respectively, P=.019). Hickman infections were associated with TRM, especially during the first 3 months posttransplantation. As such, the current results emphasize both the importance of Hickman catheter care and the need for surveillance cultures after SCT.
