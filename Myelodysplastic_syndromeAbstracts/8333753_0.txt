Two women with recurrent breast cancer presenting with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia) during chemotherapy were reported. At diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, white blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelet count were 3,300/mm3, 4600/mm3, 5.5 g/dl, 6.3 g/dl, 1.1 x 10(4)/mm3 and 6.8 x 10(4)/mm3, respectively, in case 1 and 2. Bone marrow taps showed hypercellular marrows with dysplastic changes of erythrocytes, granulocytes and megakaryocytes in both cases. Before the occurrence of the myelodysplastic syndrome, both patients received various cytotoxic agents (mitomycin C: 77 mg, 108 mg; cyclophosphamide: 34,400 mg, 40,000 mg; doxorubicin: 340 mg, 460 mg; methotrexate: 410 mg, 700 mg; and vincristine: 9.5 mg, 14 mg, in case 1 and 2, respectively). One patient died 2 months after the onset of the myelodysplastic syndrome, and the other died 3 months after due to progression of metastatic breast cancer. Risk-benefits analysis of chemotherapy, especially adjuvant chemotherapy, should be performed in cases of breast cancer.
