The serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration in patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) varies widely at similar hemoglobin concentrations, although the reasons for this variation are unclear. We have studied the pharmacokinetics of an i.v. bolus of recombinant human EPO in ten subjects with myelodysplasia. Basal serum EPO concentration varied from 210 to 5984 mU/ml. Plasma half-time clearance (t1/2) varied from 3.9 to 20.0 h. A significant positive correlation was found between t1/2 and basal EPO concentration. An increase in immature peripheral blood reticulocytes was found on days 1 and 2 after EPO treatment; this may represent either an effect on hemopoiesis or on reticulocyte release from the bone marrow.
