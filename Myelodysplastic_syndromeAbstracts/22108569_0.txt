Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are increasingly used as the graft source in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We compared long-term outcome after unrelated donor transplantation of 85 consecutive patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome regarding disease status (early disease [CR1, refractory anemia); n = 25 and advanced/active disease [>CR1, >refractory anemia]; n = 60) who were treated with conventional conditioning regimens followed by bone marrow (BM) or PBSC grafts. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted mainly of cyclosporine A, short-course methotrexate, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin. After a median follow-up of 118Â months (68-174), the 10-year event-free survival rate after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.7%-69.8%), and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), it was 27.9% (14.5%-41.3%; P < .004). In the advanced/active disease group, the 10-year event-free survival rate after PBSCT was 50% (30.8%-69.2%), and after BMT, it was 23.5% (9.3%-37.8%; P < .007). Non relapse mortality was less after PBSCT than BMT (14.3% vs 30.2%), respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, PBSCT showed a better overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.79; P = .007) compared to BMT; unfavorable/unknown prognostic impact cytogenetic abnormalities were an adverse factor for all patients (HR, 2.202; 95% CI, 1.19-4.06; P = .011). In patients with advanced disease, the use of PBSCs showed a significant favorable outcome via multivariate analysis (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-0.99; P = .046). Outcome of acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome after unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation is adversely affected by cytogenetic abnormalities and state of remission at hematopoietic cell transplantation. PBSC as a graft source has a significant favorable influence on survival.
