PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency of p15 and p16 gene promoter methylation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and to define its value in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) and treatment prognostication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow DNA obtained from 26 patients with APL at diagnosis and during follow-up was studied with the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR). Serial marrow DNA was studied by MS-PCR for MRD, and disease-free and overall survival were correlated with p15 methylation status at diagnosis. RESULTS: MS-PCR for p16 and p15 gene methylation has a maximum sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5). At diagnosis, 19 patients (73.1%) exhibited p15 methylation, whereas only three patients (11.5%) exhibited p16 methylation, all of whom had concomitant p15 methylation. During follow-up, p16 methylation was acquired in two patients, one during the third hematologic relapse, and the other during transformation into therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Six patients were evaluated serially with MS-PCR for p15 methylation at diagnosis and at follow-up examinations. Persistent p15 methylation preceded subsequent hematologic relapses in two patients, and conversion to negative MS-PCR for p15 methylation correlated with prolonged survival in another four patients. The 5-year disease-free survival of patients with p15 methylation was significantly inferior to that of patients without p15 methylation (15% v 62.5%; P =.02), and this remained significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In APL, p15 but not p16 gene methylation is frequent. It is possible that p16 methylation is acquired during clonal evolution. p15 methylation is a potential marker of MRD and might be of prognostic significance.
