The chromosome der(1;7) (q10;p10) is a derivative chromosome consisting of the short arm of chromosome 7 and the long arm of chromosome 1. We observed this abnormality in three patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). Case 1 was a 76-yr-old male with a history of IgG myeloma treated with melphalan, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (MEVP). AML-M1 developed one and half years after discontinuation of the MEVP therapy. Case 2 was a 39-yr-old male with MDS. Case 3 was a 56-yr-old male with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation that evolved from primary myelofibrosis. Chromosome analyses revealed der(1;7) (q10;p10) in bone marrow cells of the three patients. All patients failed to respond to chemotherapy, and died within four months after the diagnosis. Thus, der (1;7) (q10;p10) may indicate a very poor prognostic outcome in patients with malignant hematologic disorders.
