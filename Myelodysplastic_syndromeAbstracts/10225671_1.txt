The efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been well documented. However, ATRA is not as effective against other types of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes. We present a patient with AML (FAB: M2) associated with a t(2;17;4)(p13;q21;p16) chromosomal defect in which the 17q21 breakpoint was not within the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus which is typically rearranged in APL. This patient was successfully treated with ATRA and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and improvement of hematological parameters lasted for 19 months without the use of cytotoxic agents.
