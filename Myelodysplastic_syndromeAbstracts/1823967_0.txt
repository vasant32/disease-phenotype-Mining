In 23 patients with myelodysplasia syndromes cytomorphological examinations of peripheral red blood cells and bone marrow cells were carried out. Apart from anisocytosis and poikilocytosis observed in all patients, the most frequent changes were macrocytosis and megalocytosis or erythrocytes and their precursors, presence of erythroblasts in peripheral blood and disturbances of megakaryopoiesis. None of these changes was characteristic in a given type of these syndromes.
