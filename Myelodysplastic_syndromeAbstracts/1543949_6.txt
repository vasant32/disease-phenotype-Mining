Twenty-one patients (median age = 34, range = 10-49; F:M = 7:14) received a preparative regimen consisting of busulfan 4 mg/kg/day x 4, cytosine arabinoside 2 g/m2/12 h x 4 and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day x 2 ('BAC' regimen) for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Out of 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two were in first remission, six were in second remission and four had resistant, relapsed disease or prolonged marrow aplasia after induction chemotherapy. Five of the 12 patients with AML had secondary AML. Four patients had transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome. Three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were in the accelerated phase and two were in the blastic phase. Organ toxicities related to the preparative regimen were graded. Liver toxicity occurred in 11 patients, two of these were fatal veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (10%). Nineteen of the 21 patients had grade 2 or less diarrhea, and 13 also had mucositis. One patient developed grade 3 cardiac toxicity, and one other patient had grade 1 skin toxicity. Four patients had gross hematuria related to treatment (19%). No renal, pulmonary or CNS toxicities were encountered. Ten patients have died, two from regimen-related hepatic VOD. Of the remaining eight deaths, four were from respiratory failure in four patients (one case each of Pneumocystis pneumonia, CMV pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease, and interstitial pneumonitis complicated pulmonary emboli), and one patient each from GI bleeding, cardiac arrhythmia, sepsis and CNS bleeding. Thus far, only one patient transplanted for secondary AML in second remission relapsed at day 230.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
