We report a patient with anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) who has been given immunosuppressive therapy for Evans syndrome for 10 years. He was admitted with spike fever, intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, and multiple liver masses. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained by para-aortic lymph nodes and liver masses resulted in a diagnosis of ALCL. Immunohistochemically, these cells were reactive to anti-CD30 antibody but were not of B- or T-lineage. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated the invasion of giant neoplastic cells and trilineage myelodysplasia. Because the patient showed severe inflammatory symptoms, we examined serum levels of various cytokines. Pretreatment levels of IL-6 and VEGF in this patient were significantly elevated compared to those of normal controls. He was treated with combination chemotherapy (ABVD regimen), achieving complete remission. Myelodysplasia and serum IL-6 and VEGF also normalized after treatment. We assumed that ALCL resulted from long-term immunosuppressive therapy and that the up-regulation of IL-6 and VEGF played a role in pathogenesis of this type of lymphoma.
