Mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors in 15 untreated patients with low-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (IPSS score < or =1) resulted in poor yields in seven patients; moreover, mobilized cells had abnormal cytogenetics and defective in vitro growth. Only three out of 15 patients had adequate progenitor cell collections for potential use in autologous transplantation.
