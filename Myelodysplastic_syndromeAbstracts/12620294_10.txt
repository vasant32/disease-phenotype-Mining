Sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from the marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Engraftment of MDS cells, as determined by flow cytometry, was delayed compared to marrow from normal donors. Human CD38(+)CD34(-) cells were prominent in marrows and spleens of MDS chimeras. CD34(+)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD38(+) and T cells were also easily detected. Human myeloid cells (CD33(+); CD15(+)) were present in low proportions. No clonal precursors were identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or by molecular analysis of polymorphic X-linked markers in mice with documented engraftment of human cells more than 2 months after transplantation. These data indicate that human cells present in murine MDS chimeras, at the levels of sensitivity of our assays, were derived from residual normal cells in human MDS marrow, and suggest that the NOD/SCID environment was not conducive to the expansion of clonal MDS precursors. This model may allow identification of factors relevant for sustaining or expanding clonal precursors.
