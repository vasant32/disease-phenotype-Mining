The aim of this study was to investigate the curative effect of amifostine (AMF) combined with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on the aged patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Two aged MDS patients (one aged 91; another 86) were treated with amifostine and rhEPO over a period of 4 weeks. The results showed that a short-term curative effect was observed and transfusion interval was prolonged in both patients after 4 week treatment with 5 x 0.4 g AMF plus 3 x 6,000 U rhEPO per week. The reticulocyte count in MDS-RA patient returned to normal at first week of treatment and still remained in normal level for 4 weeks; leukocyte, hemoglobin and platelet values in peripheral blood of MDS-RCMD patient obviousby increased, the abnormally increased reticulocyte value displayed a decrease trend after amifostine plus rh-EPO treatment. In conclusion, amifostine plus rhEPO may have a good therapeutic effect for aged MDS patients, and its clinical long-term curative effect still needs further evaluation.
