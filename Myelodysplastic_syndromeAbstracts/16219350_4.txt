We investigated the therapeutic activity of recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) in association with thalidomide in 30 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), previously treated with r-EPO (n.15, group A) or thalidomide (n.15, group B) as single agents, respectively, without any significant benefit on their anemia. Four patients of group A and three of group B (23.3%) achieved an erythroid response, according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria. After 12 weeks, responders of group A continued with thalidomide alone, those of group B with r-EPO alone. All responses were maintained, thus suggesting they were likely due to the second drug adjuncted (thalidomide for group A and r-EPO for group B), rather than to a combined effect. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a synergistic activity for the association of r-EPO and thalidomide on anemia of MDS. It seems, instead, that two populations of patients can be identified, according to their sensitivity to r-EPO or, alternatively, to thalidomide.
