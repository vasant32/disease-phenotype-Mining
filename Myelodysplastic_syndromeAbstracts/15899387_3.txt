In this study, we aimed to evaluate genotoxicity by sister chromatid exchange frequency in the peripheral lymphocytes of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The study population consisted of 16 patients (females/males:6/10; mean age: 61.68 +/- 13.08 years) diagnosed with "refractory anemia" according to FAB classification. The results were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. The sister chromatid exchange frequency in the study group was found to be significantly higher than the control group (8.3 +/- 11 vs. 6.83 +/- 1.07, P=0.0046). We suggest that increased DNA damage, which is revealed by the increased sister chromatid exchange in the present study may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of MDS.
