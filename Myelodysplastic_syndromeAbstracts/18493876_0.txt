GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val that are members of the GST gene family encode for Phase II drug/xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, primarily with detoxifying function, and are polymorphic in humans. GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygous deletion genotypes do not express the enzymes. It has been hypothesised that individuals with homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 gene may have lower detoxification capacity towards genotoxic agents therefore those individuals may be at increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome which is a preleukemic condition. Genetic polymorphism of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val was investigated in a case-control study in a Hungarian patient population comprising 86 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 99 hospital-based controls. There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls for the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequencies for any of the three genes separately and in various combinations. This suggests that these genetic polymorphisms may not be strong risk factors, if any, for myelodysplastic syndrome.
