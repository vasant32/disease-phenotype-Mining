To study the serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), serum from 43 MDS patients was examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that serum levels of VEGF, bFGF in MDS patients were significantly elevated compared with normal control. Serum levels of VEGF and bFGF in RAEB patients and RAEBT patients were higher than that in RA patients and RAS patients (P < 0.05). No significant difference of serum levels of VEGF and bFGF was found between RAEBT patients and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The serum levels of VEGF and bFGF were correlated with the affected peripheral blood cells and the proportion of blast cells in bone marrow. There was positive correlation between serum VEGF and bFGF levels. It is concluded that the secretion of VEGF and bFGF in MDS patients is elevated and the serum levels of VEGF and bFGF are related to the classification and prognosis in MDS.
