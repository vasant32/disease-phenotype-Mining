Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common skin cancer in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and is well documented to occur in patients that have undergone either solid organ transplantation or conventional myeloablative bone marrow transplantation. Nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (NMAT) provides transient, intensive immunosuppression, permitting allogeneic engraftment without ablating the marrow. The purpose of this report is to describe six patients that developed SCC (n=3), basal cell carcinoma (n=2), or malignant melanoma (n=2) over a period of 2-26 months following NMAT. All patients had myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia prior to transplantation. The authors demonstrate for the first time that patients who undergo NMAT are at risk for developing skin cancers and emphasize the need for close surveillance in the post transplantation period.
