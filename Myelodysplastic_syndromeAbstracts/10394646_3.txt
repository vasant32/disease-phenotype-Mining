This paper summarises the guidelines and recommendations that were generated during a number of discussion forums attended by the majority of Belgian cytometry laboratory professionals. These forums focused on the rational and optimal use of flow cytometric evaluations in the clinical laboratory setting. The aim was to improve the coherence of the testing panels and the quality of the results and--as such--the clinical diagnostic information. It was also the aim to provide the Belgian prescribing physician and interested laymen with an updated overview of the flow cytometric possibilities. Emphasis is placed on immunophenotyping of haematological malignancies, hematopoietic progenitor cell counting and follow-up of the viral infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.
