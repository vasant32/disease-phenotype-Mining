Granulocytic sarcomas (GS) are rare extramedullary tumor masses composed of immature cells derived from the hematopoietic myeloid series. GS occur in 3% to 7% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and can present before, during, or even after the diagnosis of AML. GS can involve different organs, individually or simultaneously, including the skin, lymph nodes, bone, breast, central nervous system, and lung among others. GS involving peritoneal and pleural fluids is a rare presentation. We present an unusual case of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome whose disease progressed into a secondary AML and developed GS in the ascitic and pleural effusions as the predominant manifestation of disease progression.
