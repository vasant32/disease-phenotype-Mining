Introduction Non-infectious pulmonary complications of myelodysplasic syndromes and chronic myeloproliferative disorders are not rare but remain little known to the respiratory physician. He may be confronted with various clinical pictures corresponding to different pathophysiological causes. Background There are few data in the literature relating only to isolated cases or small series. The non infectious pulmonary complications of myelodysplasic syndromes and chronic myeloproliferative disorders can be classified into several clinical entities: tumoural syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis or diffuse infiltration, auto-immune reactions including vasculitis, Sweet's syndrome, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis..., pleural effusion and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The diagnosis is provided by the histology and the management depends on the underlying pathology. Viewpoints and conclusion Myelodysplasic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders are entities which are becoming better characterized and understood. Better knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these complications should improve their diagnosis and their management which still remains complex.
