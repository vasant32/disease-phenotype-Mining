Septic embolisms are rare disorders which are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. We describe a rare case of septic intramuscular embolism accompanied by asymptomatic pulmonary embolism in a neutropenic patient. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was detected and multiple nodules were revealed in both thighs and lung. Although he was treated with sensitive antibiotics to .S. aureus, the symptoms remained unchanged during the neutropenic period. Fever subsided rapidly and his thigh pain disappeared after neutropenia resolved. A prompt diagnosis and optimal therapeutic decisions are critical for the reduction of mortality.
