Abnormalities of chromosome 16 other than inv(16)(p13q22), t(16;16)(p13;q22), and del(16)(q22) have not been fully characterized in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We report here the first case of AML with del(16)(q11) as a sole abnormality. A 53-year-old woman was initially diagnosed as MDS, refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation with normal karyotype. After sixteen months, the disease progressed to overt AML-M1. Myeloblasts were positive for CD13, CD33, and CD34, but negative for HLA-DR. Chromosome analyses of the bone marrow cells showed 46,XX,del(16)(q11) in all metaphase spreads. Multicolor spectral karyotyping also confirmed that del(16)(q11) was not derived from a cryptic translocation, but a simple deletion. Our results, together with three previously reported cases, suggest that del(16)(q11) may be one of the recurrent aberrations in AML and that it could be associated with clonal evolution or disease progression.
