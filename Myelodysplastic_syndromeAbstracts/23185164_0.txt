Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refers to a group of haematological, monoclonal disorders. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with MDS 5q deletion syndrome [del(5q)], becoming dependent on blood transfusion after long-term treatment with cytotoxic drugs for chronic scleritis. Lenalidomide therapy (10 mg/day) led to profound pancytopaenia, followed by recovery of her blood cell counts. A cytogenetic study, repeated 4 months after lenalidomide treatment, revealed complete remission after only 1 week of lenalidomide therapy. Lenalidomide was approved for low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS, where it normalises platelet counts and induces haematological and cytogenetic remission. This patient has remained transfusion independent for 3 years by continuing on a minimal maintenance dose of lenalidomide. Starting MDS patients on lenalidomide has to be done cautiously or with only 5 mg/day because of the potentially high sensitivity of the stem cells to this immunomodulatory agent in MDS patients.
