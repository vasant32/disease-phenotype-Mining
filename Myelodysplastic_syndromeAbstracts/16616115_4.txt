We identified a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 3 and 8, with breakpoints at bands 3q26 and 8q24, in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The t(3;8)(q26;q24) was the sole cytogenetic aberration in two patients, was associated with trisomy 13 in one patient, and occurred with monosomy 7 in two patients. In three patients, the AML or MDS developed 36, 52, and 57 months following chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, respectively; in these three patients, the neoplasms were considered to be therapy-related. All five patients displayed marked trilineage dysplasia and variable degrees of cytopenias, with marked thrombocytosis noted in one patient and a normal platelet count in another patient. All patients were treated with combination chemotherapy; at writing, four were still alive and one had died during a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 16 months. We conclude that the t(3;8)(q26;q24) is a recurrent translocation associated with therapy-related MDS/AML or de novo AML, and is frequently associated with monosomy 7.
