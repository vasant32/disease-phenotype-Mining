We describe the occurrence of myelodysplastic changes (hypogranular myeloid series and Pelger cells, dyserythropoiesis with ring sideroblasts) in five of 31 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders after treatment with purine analogues. The bone marrows of 31 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders before and after treatment with purine analogues were reviewed. The majority of patients had received extensive prior treatment, but none had dysplastic changes prior to treatment with purine analogues. We suggest that a purine analogue may have been responsible for dysplastic change and that further follow-up of this phenomenon is warranted.
