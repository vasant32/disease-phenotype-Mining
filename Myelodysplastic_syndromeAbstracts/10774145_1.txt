Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome is a rare adverse effect in melanoma patients elicited by chemotherapy. We report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome following treatment of malignant melanoma with alkylating agents. Peripheral blood showed a remarkable suppression of three cell lineages, and the bone marrow was slightly hypercellular. However, no morphological abnormalities were detected in the peripheral blood or the bone marrow, and chromosomal analysis was normal.
