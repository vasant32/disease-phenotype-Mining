Ichthyosis is a cutaneous keratinization disorder that can either be congenital or acquired. Acquired ichthyosis has been reported in association with a variety of neoplastic, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with generalized ichthyosis as the first manifestation of myelodysplastic syndrome. This is the first fully described case of such an association in the English literature.
