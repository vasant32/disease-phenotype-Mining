Loss of a whole chromosome 7 or a deletion of the long arm, del(7q), are recurring abnormalities in malignant myeloid diseases. To determine the location of genes on 7q that are likely to play a role in leukemogenesis, we examined the deleted chromosome 7 homologs in a series of 81 patients with therapy-related or de novo myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Our analysis showed that the deletions were interstitial and that there were two distinct deleted segments of 7q. The majority of patients (65 of 81 [80%]) had proximal breakpoints in bands q11-22 and distal breakpoints in q31-36; the smallest overlapping deleted segment was within q22. The remaining 16 patients had deletions involving the distal q arm with a commonly deleted segment of q32-33. To define the proximal deleted segment at 7q22 at a molecular level, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of mapped yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones from 7q to examine 15 patients with deletion breakpoints in 7q22. We determined that the smallest overlapping deleted segment is contained in a well-defined YAC contig that spans 2 to 3 Mb. These studies delineate the region of 7q that must be searched to isolate a putative myeloid leukemia suppressor gene, and provide the necessary cloned DNA for more detailed physical mapping and gene isolation.
