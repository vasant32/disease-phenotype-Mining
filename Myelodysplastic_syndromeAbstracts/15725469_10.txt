Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) show occasionally thrombocytosis, common feature of myeloproliferative diseases (MPD), with the overlapping of both disorders. Classically, thrombocytosis has been associated with some MDS subtypes: refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 5q- syndrome and those MDS with 3q chromosome rearrangements. The recent WHO classification recognises an unclassifiable MDS/MPD category including some of these disorders. Our aim is to determine the frequency of presentation, subtype classification and chromosome abnormalities of MDS with thrombocytosis diagnosed in our institution. Between 1990 and 2003 we studied 317 SMD patients according to FAB and WHO revised classifications and identified 22 cases presenting thrombocytosis associated with dysplasia, that are analysed in this article.
