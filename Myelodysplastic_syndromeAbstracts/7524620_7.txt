Rearrangements of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene have been reported in a few cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In addition, low or absent expression of the RB protein is found in 20-30% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), particularly in AML with a monocytic component (M4 or M5). We performed Southern blot analysis of the RB gene in 90 cases of MDS, including 37 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). None of them had progressed to AML at the time of study. In 37/90 patients (including 20 CMML) Northern blot analysis, study of RB protein by immunocytochemistry on bone marrow slides, and detection of point mutations in exons 20-24 of the RB gene was also made, using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). No abnormal Southern profile was found in any of the 90 patients. Northern blot and immunocytochemical study of RB protein were normal in the 37 cases studied. SSCP analysis detected a point mutation in 2/37 patients tested. Direct sequencing confirmed the mutation in each case, which involved intron 21 and intron 23, respectively, and was located outside splicing sites of the neighbouring exons. These findings suggest that abnormalities of the RB gene and its expression must be very rare in MDS, and play a minor role, if any, in the pathophysiology of those disorders, at least before progression to AML.
