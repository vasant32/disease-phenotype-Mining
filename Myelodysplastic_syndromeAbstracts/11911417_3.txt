Recent reports have highlighted an associated of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with myelodysplasia (MDS). There are minimal data on the response of PRCA in this context to immunosuppression; in particular the role of cyclosporin A (CSA) has not been evaluated. We describe a patient with PRCA/MDS in whom CSA and low dose prednisolone led to restoration of marrow erythropoietic activity. Tests indicated the PRCA was likely to be mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes rather than an inhibitory effect of cytokines. These observations suggest that CSA, due to its suppressive effect on cytotoxic T cell activity, is a rational therapy in this context.
