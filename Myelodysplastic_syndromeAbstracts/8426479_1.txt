The hypothesis that 'rare' variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) alleles of the Harvey ras (Ha-ras) locus are an inherited predisposing factor in myeloid malignancies has been evaluated. We describe an application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which amplifies the VNTR region at the Ha-ras locus and offers a number of advantages over conventional Southern analysis. Ha-ras VNTR genotypes were assigned to 57 normal subjects, 46 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 26 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 49 with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). By comparison with previous reports we found significantly higher frequencies of rare alleles (20.2%) in our normal subjects of whom more than 35% had at least one 'rare' allele. The frequencies of rare alleles in the patient groups was not significantly different from the normal group (chi 2 = 0.54, p = 0.91). In studies of constitutional and leukaemic DNA from patients with AML, we found that allelic loss at the Ha-ras locus was not a common phenomenon. The improved resolution achievable with PCR compared with Southern analysis was demonstrated by the inability of Southern analysis to resolve six out of 34 PCR heterozygotes. We therefore suggest that previous studies showing linkage between rare Ha-ras alleles and susceptibility to malignancy should be reevaluated using our sensitive PCR technique.
