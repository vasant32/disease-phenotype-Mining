 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of various hematopoietic malignant patients with t(3;3)(q21;q26) or inv(3) (q21q26). METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected at presentation, prepared by short-time unstimulated culture and R-binding, and karyotyped by conventional cytogenetical assay (CCA); megalokaryocytes were detected by Streptavidin-AKP (SAP); immunotype of the leukemia cells was tested by flow cytometric anylysis of surface antigens (FACS). RESULTS: All of the 9 hematopoietic malignant patients with t(3;3)(q21;q26) or inv(3) (q21q26) manifested myelodysplasia and poor treatment response. One of them relapsed shortly after allogenic hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CONCLUSION: Patients with 3q21q26 rearrangement can be found in various hematopoietic malignances and demonstrate an unique entity. These patients show poor treatment response and have extremely poor prognosis.
