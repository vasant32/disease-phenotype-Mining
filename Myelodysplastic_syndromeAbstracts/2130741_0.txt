Forty-one patients with myeloid malignancies, majority newly diagnosed and previously untreated, were systematically karyotyped between January 1988 and December 1989 using fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU) synchronisation and Giemsa banding techniques. Eighteen patients had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 13 had one form or other of a myeloproliferative disorder and 10 fulfilled the clinical and morphological criteria for the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ten AML patients had cytogenetic abnormalities. All 6 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients carried the Philadelphia chromosome with 2 having additional abnormal clones. Only four MDS patients showed involvement of either chromosome 5 or 7.
