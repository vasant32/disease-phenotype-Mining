Balanced translocations of 11q23 are associated with specific clinical features and a poor outcome, but the relevance of deletions involving 11q23 is not clear. Fifty-seven patients with this deletion were collected by the Workshop, 30 had terminal and 27 had interstitial deletions. Twenty-seven patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 16 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one had acute biphenotypic leukemia, one had acute undifferentiated leukemia and 12 had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ALL patients had a median age of 7 years, median white blood cell count (WBC) of 15 x 10(9)/l, and 10/24 had common ALL. AML patients had a median age of 23 years, a median WBC of 49 x 10(9)/l, and 9/16 had M4 or M5. MDS patients were all adult, median age of 69 years, median WBC of 3 x 10(9)/l, and 7/12 had refractory anemia. The clinical outcome depended on diagnosis: children with ALL had a better prognosis (4/16 relapsed, one died) than AML patients; all adults and children with AML and 5/12 MDS patients died. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified 3 del(11q23) as translocations or insertions. Molecular studies revealed a MLL rearrangement in 8/10 patients. Because the involvement of MLL might be of prognostic relevance, identification of a del(11q23) should be an indication for FISH and molecular studies.
