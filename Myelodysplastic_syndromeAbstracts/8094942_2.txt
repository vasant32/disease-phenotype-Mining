Loss of chromosome material, as manifested by monosomy or partial deletion, is commonly found in neoplastic cells. We have undertaken a systematic comparison of standard cytogenetic analysis and molecular analysis for the detection of such loss, using as a model loss of chromosome 7 in 72 patients with a clonal myeloid malignancy. A large number of probes was used to screen three regions of chromosome 7 for loss by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. There were nine cases in which loss of chromosome 7 was detected by both techniques, but seven in which loss was detected by only one of the methods, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two techniques.
