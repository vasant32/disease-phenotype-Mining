A 52-year-old woman, previously treated with chemo- and radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, developed an acute non-lymphoid leukemia and, contemporarily, an IgG-kappa paraproteinemia. Cytogenetic analysis showed a major clone, representing 90% of observed metaphases, with monosomy of chromosomes 5 and 14. In addition, leukemic cells exhibited a high expression of the P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the multidrug-resistance mechanism. Possible explanations for this cluster of findings are provided.
