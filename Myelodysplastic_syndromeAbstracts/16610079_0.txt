 OBJECTIVE: To explore the implication of karyotype analysis in diagnosis and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: The chromosomes were prepared with direct method, brief culture of cells and R-banding techniques, and then the karyotypic analysis was performed. RESULT: Seventy-seven out of 283 patients (27.21%) had karyotypic abnormalities, including the numeral abnormalities of chromosomes and structural alterations. The most common chromosomal aberrations were +8, -20/20q-, -Y, translocation, -7/7q-, +9, -5/5q-. The rate of abnormal karyotype in refractory anemia with erythroblasts (RAEB) and refractory anemia erythroblasts-transformation (RAEB-t) was much higher than in refractory anemia (RA). Patients with abnormal karyotype or higher IPSS scores had a higher risk of transformation into acute leukemia than patients with normal karyotype or lower IPSS scores (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MDS is a highly heterogenous disorder and karyotype analysis is helpful for its diagnosis and prognosis estimation.
