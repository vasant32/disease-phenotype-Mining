 OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for quantitative analysis of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) based on STR loci. METHODS: Using STR technique combined with PCR, we analyzed the peripheral blood samples collected from 3 nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation recipients every 15 days after transplantation. RESULTS: The quantitative results coincided with the qualitative results of DNA electrophoresis and with the clinical outcomes. When the result of electrophoresis showed only donor's allele type we could still find out the recipient's specific allele. CONCLUSION: The quantitative analysis using STR-PCR can detect more subtle changes in the evidence of engraftment. It is a more efficient method for detect the hematopoietic chimerism post transplantation.
