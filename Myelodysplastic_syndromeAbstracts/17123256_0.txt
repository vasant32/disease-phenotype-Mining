A 4-year-old, spayed female, domestic shorthair cat was presented for lethargy, nonregenerative anemia, and inappetence. Results of a CBC included macrocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia and a glucocorticoid-associated leukogram. On blood smear examination, neutrophils had abnormal features including hyposegmentation and a diffuse chromatin pattern with nuclear filament formation and nuclear blebbing. Microscopic examination of a roll preparation of bone marrow revealed hypolobulated megakaryocytes with asynchronous maturation of nuclei. The granulocytic to erythrocyte (G:E) ratio was 76. Segmented neutrophils had asynchronous maturation and dysplastic features. The entire erythroid lineage was markedly decreased for the degree of anemia and rare dysplastic features were noted in erythroid precursor cells. The interpretation of bone marrow findings was erythroid hypoplasia, megakaryocytic dysplasia, and granulocytic hyperplasia with dysplasia. Histopathologic examination of a bone marrow core sample also revealed myeloid hyperplasia and erythroid hypoplasia. The result of a direct immunofluorescence assay for FeLV performed on the bone marrow roll preparation was positive. A diagnosis of dysmyelopoiesis associated with FeLV infection was made. This case was unique in that the dysplastic changes occurred in cell lines that did not have associated cytopenias. The dysmyelopoiesis most closely resembled myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory cytopenia (MDS-RC); however, secondary dysmyelopoiesis could not be ruled out.
