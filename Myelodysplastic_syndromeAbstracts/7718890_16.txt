We examined TP53 mutation in 57 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at either the MDS phase or at the terminal leukemic phase using polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. TP53 mutations within exons 5 through 8 were found in seven patients. All these mutations were detected at the presentation of MDS whether these patients showed leukemic transformation or not. TP53 mutations were frequently found in patients with loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-) (three of seven patients with 17p-, 43%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities (five of 14, 38%). Among the seven patients with the TP53 mutation, four patients progressed to acute leukemia within 7 months from the diagnosis of MDS, and the remaining three died within 7 months without leukemic transformation. These findings suggest that mutations of the TP53 can be implicated in leukemic transformation and a poor prognosis in MDS.
