The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57(KIP2) is thought to be a potential tumor suppressor gene (TSG). The present study examines this possibility. We found that the expression of p57(KIP2) gene is absent in various hematological cell lines. Exposing cell lines to the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored p57(KIP2) gene expression. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of its promoter region showed that p57(KIP2) DNA was completely methylated in cell lines that did not express the p57(KIP2) gene. Thus, DNA methylation of its promoter might lead to inactivation of the p57(KIP2) gene. DNA methylation of this region is thought to be an aberrant alteration, since DNA was not methylated in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in reactive lymphadenitis. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis found frequent DNA methylation of the p57(KIP2) gene in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (54.9%) and in follicular lymphoma (44.0%), but methylation was infrequent in myelodysplastic syndrome and adult T-cell leukemia (3.0% and 2.0%, respectively). These findings directly indicate that the profile of the p57(KIP2) gene corresponds to that of a TSG.
