We studied the impact of comorbidities on survival and evaluated the prognostic utility of comorbidity scores in MDS patients, who received best supportive care and were assessable according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCTCI): 171 patients were identified in the Duesseldorf MDS Registry. The HCTCI captured more comorbidities. Both scoring systems had prognostic relevance, but the HCTCI more clearly distinguished between low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients. Median survival times of the different risk groups according to the HCTCI were 68, 34 and 25 months, respectively. The HCTCI showed prognostic impact in the IPSS intermediate- and high-risk group. On multivariate regression analysis, only the HCTCI remained a prognostic factor independent of IPSS. Considering their prognostic impact, comorbidities of MDS patients should receive appropriate attention in clinical trials as well as day-to-day clinical decision making.
