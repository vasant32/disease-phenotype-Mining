Anemia, a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, develops frequently in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or cancer. Given the wide variation in clinical response to erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia associated with these diseases, 2 meta-analyses of its effectiveness were undertaken. Databases (MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts) were searched to identify relevant articles. Search terms included erythropoietin, anemia, end-stage renal disease, cancer, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Searches were limited to human subjects and the English language. Reference lists of identified articles were reviewed for further articles of interest. The primary author (W.A.M.) selected the articles, and 2 researchers, working independently, extracted the necessary data. Articles had to meet the following criteria to be included in the meta-analyses: (1) Articles must have dealt with treatment of subjects with documented anemia. (2) Studies must have been original research with sample size > or =10. (3) Abstracts could be included if the full research manuscript was unavailable. (4) Patients could not be concurrently receiving other growth factors. (5) The quality of the selected articles must have been assessed by 2 independent researchers. A clinical response to erythropoietin was defined as a 0.06 increase in hematocrit or a 20 g/L increase in hemoglobin. Thirty-nine of the 76 identified articles were included in the meta-analyses. The effectiveness of erythropoietin was calculated at 87% for ESRD, 79% for multiple myeloma, 40% for solid tumor cancer, and 13% for myelodysplastic syndrome. Both subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
