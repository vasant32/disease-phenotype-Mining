BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on health expenses caused by readmissions among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. We analyzed the rate, causes, and evolution of hospitalization after HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 140 consecutive patients who received an autologous HSCT (n = 107; 76.4%) or an allogeneic HSCT (n = 33; 23.6%) in our institution from May 2001 through September 2004. RESULTS: There were 45 readmissions in 28 patients (20%): three (10%) in the autologous and 25 (90%), in the allogeneic HSCT cohorts. The overall median age was 35.3 +/- 13.5 years and 54% were women. Hematologic diseases were: multiple myeloma (n = 1, 4%), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2, 7%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2, 7%), aplastic anemia (n = 2, 7%), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 3, 11%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 4, 14%), Hodgkin's disease (n = 4, 14%) and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (n = 10, 38%). The length of stay for each readmission was 25 +/- 21 days. The median day of readmission was +62.5 (range = +19 to +987); however, 75% occurred between days +30 and +70. The causes of hospitalization were: infections (n = 24, 54%), due to the graft (n = 14, 31%), graft failure (n = 4, 9%), coagulation disorders (n = 2, 4%), and second neoplasm (n = 1, 2%). Mortality due to the transplant was 10 patients (14%) including: graft-versus-host disease (n = 3), sepsis (n = 3), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 1), and relapse (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a frequent use of hospital resources (20%) after HSCT with patients hospitalized for a median of 25 days, it was beneficial since there were 86% survivors at 36 months follow-up.
