 OBJECTIVE: Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of hematopoietic disorders characterized by hematopoietic stem cell dysregulation and abnormalities in the immune system. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their derived stromal cells constitute a bone marrow microenvironment, which is the niche for hematopoiesis and a key compartment for immune development and regulation. Existing evidence has shown that MSCs from MDS patients have impaired capacity in supporting hematopoiesis. Here, we conducted an investigation to determine whether the immuno-modulatory function of MSCs is also impaired in MDS-RA (refractory anemia) patients. METHOD: Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs were isolated from 15 MDS-RA patients and cultured for testing biological and immunological characteristics. RESULTS: MDS-RA patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs showed normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype but appeared impaired in immuno-modulatory function. The capacity of patient Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. In conclusion, MDS-RA patient-derived MSCs have impaired immuno-modulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response may originate from MSCs rather than HSCs. MSCs might be a potential target for developing efficacious cures for MDS.
