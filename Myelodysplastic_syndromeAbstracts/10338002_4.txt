The Wilms' tumor gene WT1, whose loss of function accounts for the genesis of about 10% of Wilms' tumors, is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia. By analogy with the relationship between the kidney stem cell and Wilms' tumor, it is probable that WT1 is mutated in leukemia. WT1 mutations have been found in only eight cases of primary leukemia, mainly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and rarely in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, two other studies have demonstrated the absence of WT1 mutations in leukemia. To determine if WT1 mutations are associated with leukemias, we screened childhood nonlymphoid malignancies for WT1 mutation. WT1 mutations were found in 6 of 46 (13%) AMLs, but not in other nonlymphoid hematological malignancies. In addition, the presence of WT1 mutations in AML caused by chromosomal translocations suggests that mutations of WT1 may lead to the progression of leukemia.
