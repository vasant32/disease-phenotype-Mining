 BACKGROUND: The discovery of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-V617F has provided important insight into the pathogenesis of Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-negative MPNs); however, the etiology of JAK2(V617F)-negative Ph-negative MPN remains unidentified. MPL(W515L) and MPL(W515K) (MPL(W515L/K)) are 2 gain-of-function mutations, which have been found in some Ph-negative MPN patients from Western countries. However, little is known about the incidence of these mutations in Taiwanese Ph-negative MPN patients. METHODS: We determined the MPL sequence of DNA samples from 105 patients, including 88 patients with Ph-negative MPNs and 17 with myelodysplastic syndrome, using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cytokine receptor MPL exon 10 sequence. RESULTS: All the patients were normal at codon 515 regardless of their JAK2 status. CONCLUSION: The MPL W515L/K mutations are rare in Taiwanese patients with Ph-negative MPNs.
