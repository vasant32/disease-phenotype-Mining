Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a preleukaemic condition with myeloproliferative features, and classified as a part of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Other than alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, there is less evidence that chemotherapeutic drugs are associated with therapy-related CMML, acute leukaemia or MDS. We present a patient who developed CMML within 2 years of platinum-based chemotherapy for a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He received a cumulative dose of 240 mg/m(2) of cisplatin, and 1123 mg/m(2) of carboplatin before developing CMML. The cytogenetic study revealed trisomy 8. This is the first reported case that links platinum-based therapy with development of CMML with trisomy 8. Although the relationship between platinum therapy and the development of CMML is difficult to assess due to combinational nature of therapy in most cases, physicians should consider the possibility of CMML in patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of haematologic malignancy after platinum therapy.
