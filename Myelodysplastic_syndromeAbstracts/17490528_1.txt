The study was aimed to investigate the curative effects and adverse effects of amifostine in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Amifostine (AMF) was used alone (4/12) or combined with recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO) (8/12) in 12 MDS patients. The therapeutic regimen was adopted with AMF 0.4 g/day for 5 days, then took a break of 2 days and then went on for 3 weeks consecutively, that was reputed as one treatment cycle. rh-EPO 6 000 U was used for 3 days per week. The results showed that 12 patients all attained hematological improvement in peripheral blood. 11 cases showed major effective response rate (91.7%), while 1 case showed minor response rate (8.3%). The effective response rate of hemoglobin, leukocytes and platelets was 100%, 75% and 58.3% respectively. The intervals of red cell transfusions (RCT) in 2 cases living on red cell transfusion before AMF treatment were prolonged after AMF treatments, and the amount of each RCT was decreased obviously. The side effect was usually discomfort of digestive system, but all patients can endure. In conclusion, Amifostine is a potential drug in the treatment of MDS patients with safety especially to those elder patients who often suffered from other multiple organ disfunctions, and the curative effect will be improved by more treatment cycles.
