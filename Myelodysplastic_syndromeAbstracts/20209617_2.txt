 BACKGROUND: Lineage involvement and maturation arrest are considered to have prognostic significance in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, although the prognostic value of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and monocytosis have been documented, little is known about the impact of eosinophils and basophils. METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic significance of eosinophils and basophils in 1008 patients with de novo MDS. Patients were enrolled from 3 centers of the Austrian-German MDS Working Group and were analyzed retrospectively. Blood eosinophils and basophils were quantified by light microscopy, and their impact on survival and leukemia-free survival was calculated by using Cox regression. RESULTS: Eosinophilia (eosinophils >350/microL) and basophilia (basophils >250/microL) predicted a significantly reduced survival (P < .05) without having a significant impact on leukemia-free survival. In multivariate analysis, eosinophilia and basophilia were identified as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-independent prognostic variables with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-specific impact. Although elevated LDH was identified as a major prognostic determinant in IPSS low-risk, intermediate-1 risk, and high-risk subgroups, the condition "eosinophilia and/or basophilia" was identified as a superior prognostic indicator in the IPSS intermediate-2 risk subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of eosinophils and basophils in patients with MDS was helpful and may complement the spectrum of variables to optimize prognostication in MDS.
