We have evaluated the function of granulocytes in 14 patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We also evaluated the functional and immunochemical activities of five monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) reactive with the CD11/CD18 leucocyte adhesion molecules of granulocytes. Granulocytes showed a decrease in chemotaxis (P < 0.001) and in aggregation (P < 0.01) using various agents as a stimulus. Cytofluorimetric and immunoenzymatic assays with alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) analysis showed decreased expression of the CD11b/CD18 receptor detected by OKM1 (P < 0.001). Despite LFA-1 and-CD11a/CD18 was expressed in normal amounts. The studies of upregulation of granulocytes CD11b/CD18 and image analysis of immunochemical preparation (APAAP) demonstrated decreased expression of CD11b/CD18 in granulocytes from MDS compared to controls (P < 0.001). We conclude that granulocyte dysfunction in MDS may be correlated with decreased expression of surface CD11b/CD18 leucocyte adhesion molecules or their structural modification.
