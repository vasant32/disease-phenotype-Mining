To the significance of basophilia in haematopoietic disorders, six draw attention to cases have been analyzed. Associated diseases included acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML-M2, M3, M4, and M6), refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). Two AML cases (M2, M6) were preceeded by myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). All patients showed greater than 3% basophilia in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Basophils were identified successfully by metachromatic staining with toluidine blue in all cases. Three patients (M3, M4, RAEB) presented with lymphadenopathy, suggesting an association with extramedullary involvement. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity was significantly reduced in four patients with AML (M2, M3, M4) and RAEB-T. The clinical course was generally unfavourable characterized by short remission duration or disease progression except for the patient with RAEB. Haemorrhage was the main cause of death rather than infection. Cytogenetic analysis revealed unique abnormalities involving chromosomes 3q21, 5q31, and 17q11 where the genes for some haematopoietic growth factors or their receptors are located, in addition to t(6;9) and t(15;17).
