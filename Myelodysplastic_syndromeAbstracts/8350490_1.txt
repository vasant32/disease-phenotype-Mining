Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was started in Hokkaido in 1985. In the present report we have reviewed the clinical outcome of patients treated with BMT for hematological diseases in Hokkaido. Fifty-eight allogeneic and 19 autologous transplants were registered by December 1991. The underlying diseases consisted of 47 leukemias, 14 lymphomas, 10 aplastic anemias and six myelodysplastic syndromes. Among the allogeneic BMT cases, 55 were human leucocyte antigen (HLA) identical and three were mismatched. Among the autologous BMT patients, two received their marrow purged with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and five, with monoclonal antibodies and complements. The conditioning regimens used for malignancies were chiefly cyclophosphamide (CY) plus total body irradiation, or busulfan plus CY. In many cases, cytokines were used for rapid recovery of decreased leukocytes. Engraftment was observed in 50 out of 52 evaluated allogeneic and 18 out of 19 autologous transplants. Ten allogeneic patients suffered from severe acute graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD), and extensive chronic GVHD appeared in 16 patients. Relapses were observed in four cases of allogeneic BMT and six of autologous BMT. The major complications were interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and severe infections. Long-term survival rates were almost 60% in both allogeneic and autologous transplants. Mild acute GVHD and limited chronic GVHD increased the survival rates. The results indicated that substantial problems such as GVHD, IP and relapses must be controlled in the near future for an improved outcome to be made possible.
