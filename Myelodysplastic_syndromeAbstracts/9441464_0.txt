Secondary or therapy related myelodysplastic syndrome may develop following treatment with alkylating agents and radiotherapy. The condition may also follow high dose therapy for malignant lymphomas. We describe two patients who developed secondary myelodysplasia. The first is a 76-year old female with a low grade lymphoma who developed pancytopenia with monosomy 7. Secondary myelodysplasia was diagnosed 24 months after treatment with chlorambucil (total dose of 900 mg) and 12 months after treatment with trophosphamide (total dose of 24 g). The second patient was a 48-year old male who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for a relapsed low grade lymphoma. Following autografting he had persistent anemia and trombocytopenia. Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome with complex karyotype was diagnosed 54 months after high dose therapy. He died nine months later of bone marrow failure.
