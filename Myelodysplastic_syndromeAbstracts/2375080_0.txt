The authors summarize their experience with the administration of small doses of cytosine arabinoside continuously by subcutaneous infusion in 13 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Alcysten Spofa was administered in doses of 20 mg/sq.m per day for 5-17 days in one cycle. A total of 26 therapeutic cycles were administered. Favourable responses were obtained in four patients, partial results were achieved in two patients; in seven instances treatment produced no response. The authors compare also the results obtained in this group with a previous group of 11 patients treated with small doses of cytosine arabinoside, which was administered intermittently, i.e. twice a day by the subcutaneous route. Continuous administration did not produce more favourable therapeutic results, it caused however a larger number of infections and haemorrhagic complications as compared with intermittent administration. The authors recommend administration of small doses of cytosine arabinoside in patients with prognostically adverse types of myelodysplastic syndrome - intermittently 10 mg subcutaneously twice a day for 14-21 days.
