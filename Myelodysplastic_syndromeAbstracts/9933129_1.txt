The stem cell factor (SCF: a ligand for c-kit) plays a central role in the growth of myelodysplastic (MDS) progenitor cells with leukemic type growth. In this study, the role of physiologic concentrations of SCF on the proliferation and differentiation on MDS progenitor cells was further analyzed in the presence of combined cytokines. For this purpose, marrow CD34+ cells were purified up to 94% for 12 normal individuals and 90% for 18 MDS patients, using monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic microspheres. The purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days with saturating doses of cytokines, including recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3) and rSCF. The clonal growth of MDS CD34+ cells supported by a combination of all the above cytokines was then subdivided into the two patterns of leukemic or non-leukemic. The role of various concentrations of rSCF (0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 ng ml(-1)), with or without the above cytokines, in proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34+ cells was analyzed in each group. The physiologic concentration of SCF at 5 ng ml(-1) significantly increased undifferentiated 'blast cell' colonies or clusters in leukemic type growth of MDS CD34+ cells over that seen in normal CD34+ cells. SCF is present in plasma at a level of ng ml(-1). This means that progenitor cells are continuously exposed to stimulation by SCF in vivo and that MDS leukemic cells have a growth advantage over normal blasts.
