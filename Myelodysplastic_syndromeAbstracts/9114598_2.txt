Ten children with myelodysplastic syndrome underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with an intensified conditioning regimen. The median age of the patients was 8 years (range 2-10), and included 6 males and 4 females. The subtype of the disease was refractory anemia (RA) in 4, RA with excess blasts (RAEB) in 4, RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) in 1, and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) in 1. All patients were conditioned with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (12000 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and either total body irradiation (10-13.2 Gy) or busulfan (16 mg/kg or 560 mg/m2). Cyclosporine A and/or methotrexate were used for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Engraftment was prompt in all but one patient. Severe acute GVHD (grade 3) (n = 1), interstitial pneumonitis (n = 1) and veno-occlusive disease of the liver (n = 1) occurred. The disease relapsed in one patient with RAEB-T. Seven of the 10 patients were alive and disease free 2-74 months after BMT. The disease-free survival rate at 4 years was 69 +/- 15%. All surviving patients were in the full performance status. The examined children with MDS tolerated this intensified conditioning regimen well.
