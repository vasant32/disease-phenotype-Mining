A translocation involving the short arm of chromosome #1 and the short arm of chromosome #7, [t(1;7)(p11;p11)] was present in four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Two of these patients had prior lymphoproliferative disorders and developed MDS following prolonged therapy with alkylating agents. One of the patients with prior therapy history has two additional independent abnormal clones: one with a partial deletion of the long arm of #7 and the other with t(1;7)(q21;q11). A third patient had a family history of leukemia in both the father and a brother, both of whom developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia following an MDS phase. The last patient was an elderly woman with no predisposing features.
