Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are comprised of a heterogeneous group of stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and susceptibility to transform to acute myeloid leukemia. The molecular pathways underlying disease initiation and evolution are still largely unknown. We recently demonstrated that acquired mutations in PTPN11 are a major event in JMML and occur with variable prevalence in children with other hematologic malignancies, including MDS. Here, we investigated contribution of PTPN11 mutations to adult MDS and CMML pathogenesis. Our results indicate that PTPN11 lesions might play a role in adult MDS/CMML pathogenesis but do not represent a major molecular event.
