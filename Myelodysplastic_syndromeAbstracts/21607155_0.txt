Granulocytic sarcoma is an uncommon and localized extramedullary tumor composed of immature granulocytic cells. It may present in association with acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Granulocytic sarcoma may occur in any anatomical site but involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is rare, especially in the rectum. We report on the case of a 17 year old female who presented with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain and weight loss one mo prior to admission. Rectosigmoidoscopy revealed a rectal polypoid and ulcerated mass. The histological examination of the mass showed granulocytic sarcoma. Bone marrow examination was compatible with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB type M3). This case report is a reminder of this peculiar sign of tumoral syndrome in acute myeloid leukaemia. We also discuss diagnostic methods and analyze the disease course.
