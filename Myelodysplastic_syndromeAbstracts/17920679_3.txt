 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide, retinoic acid and thalidomide combination therapy in higher risk MDS. METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with higher risk MDS were administered 10mg/day arsenic trioxide intravenously for 10 days, 40mg/day retinoic acid orally for 2 weeks and 100mg/day thalidomide orally for 4 weeks per cycle. RESULTS: After at least two treatment cycles, 10 patients showed hematologic responses. One achieved CR, one achieved PR, three patients achieved major hematological improvements. The efficacy rate was 24% (5/21), and the response rate was 48% (10/21). The schedule was tolerated well by all patients and toxicities were moderate and reversible. CONCLUSION: The combination of arsenic trioxide, retinoic acid and thalidomide could have therapeutic benefit in higher risk MDS with safety.
