AIM: To analyse incidence rate of chromosomal aberrations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), specification of clinicomorphological features of some cytogenetic variants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chromosomal analysis by the method of G-differential staining of chromosomes was made in 209 patients with different variants of MDS. RESULTS; Clonal chromosomal aberrations occured in 60.8%. The following aberrations were found most frequently: deletion of the long arm of the chromosome 5 (del(5q)) - 34.6%, trisomy of chromosome 8 (14.1%), monosomy of chromosome 7 (13.4%), aberrations 3q21q26 (12.6%), aberrations of a long arm of X-chromosome (4.7%), the absence of Y-chromosome (3.1%). Complex aberrations of karyotype were found in 13.5% cases. Chromosomal aberrations determined not only clinical and morphological features but also the prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic examination is an essential component of MDS patients examination. It allows more precise classification of MDS variant and prognostification of the disease course.
