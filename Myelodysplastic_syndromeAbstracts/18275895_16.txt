Because natural killer (NK) cells can be potent anti-tumor effectors after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we investigated NK reconstitution and receptor expression in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, focusing on the activating receptors that trigger anti-tumor responses. We determined that NK levels in the peri-transplant period were inversely proportional to the dramatic rise and fall in plasma levels of the NK homeostatic cytokine IL-15, which increased more than 50-fold from pretreatment to the day of transplant during the lymphoreductive preparative regimen. Furthermore, in NK cells cultured with IL-15, we observed an up-regulation of the activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, and NKp46, associated with an increase in anti-tumor lytic activity. Similarly, the expression of these activating receptors increased significantly during the early post-transplant period, concurrent with a rapid increase in total NK cells and a shift toward increased expression of CD56. These data suggest that the cytokine milieu of transplants, in particular elevated levels of IL-15, may contribute to anti-tumor efficacy post-transplant by enhancing the recovery of NK subsets and modulating expression of activating receptors.
