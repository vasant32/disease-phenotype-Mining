RAS mutations can be detected in a variable number of patients with myeloproliferative disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, but are rare events in chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase. However, there is good evidence supporting the involvement of RAS signalling pathway in CML and this could be due to alterations in RAS activity regulatory proteins. The neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene down-regulates the RAS signal transduction pathway through the inhibitory function of its GAP-related domain (GRD) on RAS protein. The loss or alteration of neurofibromin (the NF1 protein) may produce a disfunction similar to point mutations in the RAS gene resulting in the permanent stimulation of the RAS signal transduction pathway. Mutations involving the GRD region of the NF1 gene (GRD-NF1) have been described in a variety of tumors such as colon carcinoma and astrocytoma. Germline mutations and deletions in the NF1 gene, as seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, are also associated with certain myeloid disorders. In the present work, we sought to identify mutations in the codons 12/13 and 61 of RAS gene and in the Lys-1423 codon of GRD-NF1, which are well known hot spots in these genes, in a group of 36 adults and ten children with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase and blast crisis. Using the PCR-SSCP and the allele-specific restriction assay (ASRA) techniques, we were not able to observe any RAS or NF1 detectable mutation. These findings suggest that RAS and GRD-NF1 mutations are not involved either in chronic phase or in the progression to blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia in adults and children.
