 BACKGROUND: The optimal antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing induction chemotherapy has yet to be identified. A prospective historical control study evaluated the efficacy and safety of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) in this patient population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with AML or high-risk MDS who were undergoing induction chemotherapy received prophylactic ABLC 2.5 mg/kg intravenously 3 times weekly. This treatment group was compared with a historical control group that had similar baseline characteristics and received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) 3 mg/kg 3 times weekly. The primary endpoint was the incidence of documented or suspected fungal infections during and up to 4 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis. Reported adverse events were used to assess tolerability. RESULTS: The overall efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis was similar in patients who received ABLC and patients who received L-AmB (P=0.95). Among 131 ABLC-treated patients and 70 L-AmB-treated patients who were assessed for efficacy and safety, 49% of patients in each group completed therapy without developing a documented or suspected fungal infection. Documented fungal infections occurred in 5% of ABLC-treated patients and in 4% of L-AmB-treated patients. Alternative antifungal strategies were required because of persistent fever or pneumonia of unknown pathogen in 28% and 32% of ABLC-treated and L-AmB-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, therapy discontinuations due to adverse events, and survival rates also were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: ABLC and L-AmB appeared to have similar efficacy and were tolerated well as antifungal prophylaxis in patients with AML and high-risk MDS who were undergoing induction chemotherapy.
