The combination of flow cytometric scatterplot analysis and specific monoclonal antibodies was used to evaluate the lineage of cells from six dogs with proliferative disorders of bone marrow. Scatterplot analysis was used to identify mature and immature myeloid and erythroid cells. The immunophenotype of cells in the immature myeloid gate was determined by labeling cells with four monoclonal antibodies. These results were compared to results of cytologic and cytochemical evaluation. The immunophenotype of a dog with a diagnosis of myelogenous leukemia was a cluster of differentiation-18 (CD-18) positive, CD-14 negative, Thy-1 negative, and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II negative. The immunophenotype of a dog with a diagnosis of myelomonocytic leukemia was CD-18 positive, CD-14 positive, Thy-1 positive, and MHC class II positive. Although this phenotype clearly differentiated myelomonocytic leukemia from myelogenous leukemia, it was similar to the immunophenotype of dogs with a diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis or hemophagocytic syndrome. The immunophenotype of two dogs with myelodysplastic syndrome was CD-18 positive and CD-14 negative. Results for Thy-1 and MHC class II were variable. As additional lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies become available, immunophenotyping should become a valuable tool for determination of the lineage of cells in canine myeloproliferative disorders.
