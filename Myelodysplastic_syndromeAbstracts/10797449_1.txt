We report on the flow cytometric identification of concomitant acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in cytology specimens submitted with minimal clinical information. A 64-year-old man presented with fever and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan showed a left upper lobe pulmonary mass. Pulmonary capillary pullback specimens were collected to determine infectious verses neoplastic etiology. The pulmonary capillary pullback specimens showed atypical mononuclear cells with enlarged, slightly irregular nuclei; visible nucleoli; and basophilic cytoplasm. Flow cytometric analysis of the specimen for lymphoma was requested. Flow cytometric immunophenotypic studies showed that 78% of the cells were CD34 positive, CD45 dim positive and CD11c positive, consistent with acute myeloid leukemia. About 0. 75% of the cells expressed CD5 as well as dim CD20 and were monoclonal for kappa light chains: consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. At this time the clinician communicated a history of myelodysplastic syndrome of refractory anemia subtype. Peripheral blood was obtained for further immunophenotyping and the patient was immediately treated for his acute myeloid leukemia. This case demonstrates that a diagnostic antibody panel should allow evaluation of all cell types as per the U.S./Canadian consensus recommendations on the immunophenotypic analysis of hematologic neoplasia by flow cytometry (Stewart et al.: Cytometry 30:231-235, 1997).
