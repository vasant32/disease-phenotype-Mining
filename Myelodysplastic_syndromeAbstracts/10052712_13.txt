During the 18-yr period 1976-93, a population-based series of 1586 adults with suspected or confirmed hematological malignancies were successfully cytogenetically investigated at a single center. Eighty-six cases were excluded due to unretrievable medical records or if analyzed only in remission or at relapse. The remaining 1500 medical records were reviewed regarding morphology and clinical parameters in order to investigate possible associations between karyotypic pattern (normal, 1, 2 or complex anomalies; specific abnormalities) and gender, age and morphological subgroups. The impact of time-period, i.e. 1976-87 vs. 1988-93, and referring center on cytogenetic findings was also studied. A total of 372 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 389 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 64 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 262 chronic myeloid leukemias (CML) were identified, altogether 1087 cases. Patients with other (n=261) or no hematological malignancies (n = 152) were excluded from the present analysis. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 52% AML, 51 % MDS, 68% ALL and 97% CML, frequencies that did not differ significantly between the 2 time periods or referring centers. No significant age- or gender-related differences in karyotypic patterns were discerned in AML, MDS, ALL or CML, whereas the karyotypic patterns varied among the FAB groups in both AML (p= 0.001) and MDS (p < 0.001). The specific abnormalities t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16) were more common (p < 0.001) in younger AML patients and 5q- was more frequent in females with MDS (p<0.001). These findings indicate, in contrast to previous series, that neoplasia-associated karyotypic aberrations are not more common among older patients or in males.
