The patient was initially diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was cured following treatment with prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin, 1-asparaginase, and cyclophosphamide. Seven years and two months later, he developed osteosarcoma in his right femur. He received chemotherapy consisting of methotrexate, carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide and again obtained remission. After 2 years and 7 months, however, he was found to have pancytopenia with morphological abnormalities in the erythroid and myeloid series. Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was made. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed -5 and -7, which is typical for secondary MDS. This is a rare case of third malignancy presumably caused by alkylating agents.
