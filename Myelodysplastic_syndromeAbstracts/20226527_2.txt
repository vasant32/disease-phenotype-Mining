In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) chromosomal anomalies can be identified in 50-80% of patients. They have a diagnostic and prognostic impact and are increasingly considered for therapeutic decisions. Cytomorphology and cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow (bm) cells define the goldstandard to diagnose MDS patients and to document treatment response. We present a novel method using peripheral blood (pb) for frequent cytogenetic monitoring: after immunomagnetic cell separation circulating CD34+ cells were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We compared FISH analyses of enriched and non-enriched pb and bm cells with conventional chromosome banding analyses of bm metaphases: analysing circulating CD34+ cells by FISH is a sensitive, reliable method to measure the abnormal cell clones in pb. This method is practicable, non-invasive, representative for the clonal situation in the bm, and has a predictive value. Its feasibility was proven in a cohort of 27 MDS patients.
