 BACKGROUND: Hemolysis as a result of donor-recipient minor ABO mismatching is a complication of allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation (PBPCT). The increased B-lymphocyte content of PBPC grafts and immunosuppressive regimens without methotrexate (MTX) may increase incidence and severity of this event. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients were analyzed after allogeneic PBPCT. In 25 (27%) cases, minor (n=21) or bidirectional (n=4) ABO mismatching was present. Of these, 15 patients received myeloablative and 10 received nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. For GVHD, prophylaxis cyclosporin A (CsA) alone (n=2) or CsA with MTX (n=13) was given after myeloablative conditioning and CsA with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after nonmyeloablative conditioning (n=10). RESULTS: Hemolysis occurred in 4 out of 25 (16%) patients with minor or bidirectional ABO mismatching only. Three patients underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning and were given CsA with MMF, and one patient underwent myeloablative conditioning and was given CsA alone for GVHD prophylaxis. Hemolysis began 7 to 10 days after transplantation, and donor type alloantibodies were detectable concomitantly with recipients type RBCs. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving minor or bidirectional ABO-mismatched PBPC grafts and GVHD prophylaxis without MTX are at risk of hemolysis. Prophylactic interventions in patients before minor ABO-mismatched PBPCT not receiving MTX should be taken into consideration. Careful monitoring of hemolysis parameters during the first 15 days after PBPCT transplantation is mandatory.
