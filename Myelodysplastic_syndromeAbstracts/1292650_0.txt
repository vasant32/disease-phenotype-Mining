The in vitro growth of circulating erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) populations and the production of burst-promoting activity (BPA) by T lymphocytes have been studied in 17 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Based on the in vitro growth patterns of BFU-E, four groups of patients have been identified: i) normal BFU-E growth; ii) low spontaneous BFU-E growth, but normal response to LCM; iii) impaired BFU-E response to LCM; iv) no BFU-E growth. The pattern of BFU-E growth seems to be related to the clinical stage of the disease rather than to the FAB subgroup to which the patients belong. The ability of T lymphocytes to stimulate BFU-E growth was significantly reduced in all patients. The possible mechanisms inducing the impaired production of BPA by T lymphocytes are discussed. The in vitro evaluation of circulating erythroid precursors can supply useful prognostic information and possibly indications concerning the responsiveness of erythropoietic stem cells to recombinant human erythropoietin in vivo.
