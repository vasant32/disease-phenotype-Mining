A 24-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia) was treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-identical brother on September 9, 1994, after conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. From early in April 1995, the patient complained of cough and fever. Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates involving hilar and lower lung fields. Although pulmonary infiltrates were resolved with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, on May 19, the patient rapidly deteriorated with dyspnea. Diffuse alveolar infiltrates appeared on chest X-ray and he died of respiratory failure. At autopsy, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage accompanied with thickening of the alveolar walls and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes was demonstrated. There was no evidence of bleeding in other organs. This is a rare case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the late stage of allogeneic BMT. This report should lead to an evaluation of this disease by the collection of similar cases.
