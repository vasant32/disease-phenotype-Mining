Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine with hypomethylating and antileukemia activity. Azacitidine has been shown to have survival benefits in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and has activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection daily at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days every 4 weeks. An oral formulation would facilitate dosing, reduce administration side effects and potentially maximize azacitidine pharmacologic action. Previously, oral formulations of this class of agent have failed due to rapid catabolism by cytidine deaminase and hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Development of a film-coated formulation has circumvented this difficulty. In a formulation feasibility pilot study, four subjects with solid malignant tumors, AML or MDS received single oral doses of 60 or 80 mg azacitidine. Subjects demonstrated measurable plasma concentrations of azacitidine, allowing bioavailability comparisons to be made to historical pharmacokinetic data for s.c. azacitidine. Subjects safely tolerated 80 mg, a dose for which the mean bioavailability was 17.4% of historic s.c. exposure. No severe drug-related toxicities were observed. These data suggest that oral azacitidine is bioavailable in humans and should be studied in formal phase 1 trials.
