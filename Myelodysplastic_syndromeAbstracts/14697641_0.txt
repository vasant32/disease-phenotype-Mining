We report a case of a psu dic(6;5)(p21.3;q13) in a patient with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) following treatment for multiple myeloma. The abnormal chromosome was isolated by flow karyotyping and initially identified by reverse chromosome painting. The findings were then confirmed by forward painting. The value of flow karyotyping as a diagnostic technique in hematologic malignancies is discussed.
