 UNLABELLED: We describe a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7 presenting with a T-cell defect. He suffered from infections from the age of 10 years, when a CD4 deficiency and impaired lymphoproliferative responses in vitro were found. The only symptom of a myelodysplastic syndrome at that time was thrombocytopenia with giant platelets. Monosomy 7 was found in the bone marrow cells. At the age of 11 years he developed other characteristics of monosomy 7 including splenomegaly and anaemia. Some months later leukaemia was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: In non-HIV CD4 deficiency myelodysplastic syndrome has to be considered.
