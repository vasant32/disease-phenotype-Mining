The purpose of this study was to analyse, by immunomorphometry, megakaryocytopoiesis in patients with myelodysplatsic syndrome. The results revealed that, in spite of marked megakaryocyte hyperplasia, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome suffer from severe peripheral thrombocytopenia. Megakaryocytes in myelodisplastic syndrome have, in average, small cellular and nuclear diameter and 35.3% of them (s. c. micromegakaryocyres) can be identified only by using immunohistochemical technique. In conclusion, there is severe maturation disturbancy, ineffectiveness and disregulation of megakaryocytopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome.
