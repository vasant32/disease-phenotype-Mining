A case of isolated thrombocytopenia with decreased platelet production and abnormal megakaryopoiesis is described. In the bone marrow, a chromosomally aberrant clone, 45,XX,-11,-18,+der (11;18)(11q13;18p11), was found. These findings indicate a myelodysplastic nature of the abnormal thrombocytopoiesis. The described case demonstrates the value of a bone marrow examination including histopathology with immunologic techniques to evaluate the megakaryopoiesis in thrombocytopenia and the interest of cytogenetic studies not only in instances with overt hematologic malignancies or complete myelodysplastic syndromes, but also when morphologic abnormalities occur in a single cell line.
