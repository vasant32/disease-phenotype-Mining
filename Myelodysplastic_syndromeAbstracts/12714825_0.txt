The case of an 80-year-old woman displaying myelodysplastic syndrome evolving into a myeloproliferative disorder with myelofibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, is reported. This case is characterized by an initial presentation of a myelodysplastic syndrome with normal karyotype and moderate fibrosis, its evolution towards a myeloproliferative disorder with myelofibrosis and the worsening of pulmonary fibrosis in parallel to the acceleration of the myeloproliferative disorder and myelofibrosis. These features and the high concentration of plasma platelet factor-4 suggest a role of megakaryocyte/platelet degranulation in the development of fibrosis.
