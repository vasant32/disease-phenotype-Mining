Although the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is most common in the elderly, younger patients, including women of child-bearing age, may be affected. The association of MDS with pregnancy appears to be very rare: fewer than 25 cases have been reported. We report the outcomes of seven pregnancies in four women seen at the Mayo clinic between 1983 and 2000. Three of the women were found to have MDS when an abnormal complete blood count was detected during routine prenatal care. The fourth patient had an apparently congenital MDS, and suffered three spontaneous abortions before undergoing premature menopause as a result of pelvic irradiation for vulvar cancer. We discuss some of the unique concerns regarding pregnant patients with MDS. As women give birth at older ages and as more young persons survive cancer, MDS and pregnancy are likely to be seen together with increasing frequency.
