 AIMS: To obtain accurate incidence data for myelodysplasia in the Wellington Region of New Zealand (NZ), to analyse the treatment these patients received and to review their outcome. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with myelodysplasia between 1 January 2002 and 1 September 2007 were identified. Their bone marrow biopsy, clinical record, cytogenetic analysis and transfusion record were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy myelodysplastic patients were identified yielding an incidence of 2.75 per 100,000 per year. Median survival was 23 months, and transformation to acute leukaemia occurred in five patients (7.1%). Three patients (4.3%) received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and five patients (7.1%) received disease modifying treatment. Fifty-six of 70 patients (80%) received a blood transfusion, a mean of 32.9 red blood cell (RBC) units were transfused to each transfusion recipient during the study period of 68 months. One of 70 patients developed a clinical syndrome of iron overload. CONCLUSION: The incidence of myelodysplasia in Wellington, NZ is similar to incidence figures from previously published studies. The treatment these patients received was predominantly supportive through RBC transfusion. Effective iron chelation therapy measures were not used although there appeared to be a low incidence of clinical iron overload in the study population. The data in this study will be available for comparison with future studies to assess trends in incidence, treatment and outcome in myelodysplastic patients in NZ.
