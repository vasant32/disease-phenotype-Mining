We report a 56-year-old male patient with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) who had an ins(8;3)(q24;q21q26) as the sole chromosome abnormality in bone marrow (BM) cells. The findings of disturbed thrombocytopoiesis with numerous micromegakaryocytes suggest that it could be a variant of the classic ins(3;3)(q26;q21q26) described in hematologic malignancies with abnormal thrombopoiesis.
