 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to improve the predictive power of the WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) by including age in patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 136 Korean patients with de novo MDS between 1995 and 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. All patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria. 114 patients were included in the final analysis. An individualized age-adapted scoring system was developed to improve the accuracy of prognosis of the WPSS. RESULTS: The WPSS was significantly associated with the prediction of survival and the leukemia-free survival. While the risk of a patient with the WPSS was best represented by the values 0 (very low), +1 (low), +2 (intermediate), +3 (high), and +4 (very high), these values were found to vary between -1.0 and 4.2 in the same patients when age was included as a factor. The WPSS may vary according to age, <55 or â‰¥55 years. The estimated difference in median survival was more prominent in the lower risk groups of the WPSS than in the higher-risk groups. CONCLUSION: In addition to the WPSS, age was found to significantly influence the prognosis of patients with MDS and provided a more individualized prognosis for the patients with MDS.
