 PURPOSE: To describe an unusual ocular manifestation of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 59-year-old woman with a history of preleukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) complained of a sudden onset of poor vision associated with a corneal pseudomembrane. Ocular graft vs host disease was suspected, and the pseudomembrane was excised for histopathologic examination. RESULTS: The pseudomembrane showed myeloblasts admixed with an acute inflammatory response suggestive of the development of AML, a complication of MDS. Bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of relapsing AML. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myeloid leukemia could present as a pseudomembrane; thus, examination of relevant ocular tissue is recommended.
