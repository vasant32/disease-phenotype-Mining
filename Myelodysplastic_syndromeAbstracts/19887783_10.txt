 PURPOSE: To investigate the possible prognostic factors of survival outcomes in patients with granulocytic sarcoma (GS). METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the prognostic factors determining survival in 24 patients with GS using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by log rank tests. We evaluated gender, age, location, GS antedating leukemia, underlying disorders, treatment type and stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate for the patients with GS was 21%. The patients undergoing chemotherapy had a significantly longer survival time compared to those who did not (p = 0.0009). We found no difference in the 5-year survival rate among the patients undergoing chemotherapy combined with radiation or surgery. Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders had worse survival rates (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis with biopsy and early chemotherapy can improve survival outcome. Local radiation or surgery can improve symptoms but does not influence survival outcomes.
