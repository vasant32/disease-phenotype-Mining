The protein-tyrosine kinase gene Itk is expressed preferentially in T lymphoid cells of the mouse and is induced by IL-2. A related gene, Btk, is expressed in the murine B lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Because mutations in Btk and the corresponding human gene are associated with X-linked immunodeficiency syndromes, it was of interest to map Itk and its human counterpart. By Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny of two multilocus crosses, murine Itk was mapped to Chromosome 11. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, human ITK was mapped to 5q32-q33. Murine Itk and its human homologue lie within regions of conserved synteny that include several growth factor and growth factor receptor genes. This region in humans is frequently deleted in the myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting possible involvement of ITK in this disorder.
