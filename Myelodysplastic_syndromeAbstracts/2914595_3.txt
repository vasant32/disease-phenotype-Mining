It has been shown that haem arginate treatment increases blood cell counts, improves the sideroblast status of the bone marrow and normalises decreased activities of haem synthesising enzymes in some patients with acquired sideroblastic anaemia, or with other types of myelodysplastic syndromes. 4 patients with hereditary sideroblastic anaemia (HSA), belonging to two families, were therefore treated with haem arginate infusions, 3 mg/kg, on 4 consecutive days, and thereafter weekly for 10 wk. No effect was observed on the mildly anaemic haemoglobin levels or on the red cell counts. However, the initially low or low-normal myeloid to erythroid ratio in the marrow increased in all patients. A consistent decrease in the percentage of ring sideroblasts and other abnormal sideroblasts was seen in 1 patient (Family A), and a temporary decrease of abnormal sideroblasts took place during the most intensive treatment period in 2 other patients (Family B). Two of three initially abnormal haem synthesising enzyme activities became normal in Family A, whereas no clearly consistent effects on the haem synthesising enzymes were observed in Family B. The present study shows that haem arginate infusions can normalise the activities of haem synthesising enzymes in some patients with HSA. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of haem infusions on the iron balance of these patients.
