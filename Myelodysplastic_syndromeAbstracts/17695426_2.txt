 BACKGROUND: Low-dose cytarabine (ara-C) has been used to treat older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but has resulted in complete remission for <20% of cases. A pilot study of the efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using low-dose ara-C, melphalan (Mel), and mitoxantrone (Mit) was conducted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment comprised ara-C (10 mg/m2) twice daily, melphalan (2 mg/body) every other day, and mitoxantrone (3 mg/m2) every 3 days. The treatment was discontinued if the nuclear cell count was <15,000/microl with <20% blast count in the bone marrow. The primary end-points were initial response and tolerability. RESULTS: The study comprised 9 patients with AML or high-risk MDS (median age, 75 years). Complete remission was achieved in 3 patients. All the patients displayed grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. One patient died from sepsis. CONCLUSION: The present regimen was more effective and displayed similar safety, compared with low-dose ara-C alone.
