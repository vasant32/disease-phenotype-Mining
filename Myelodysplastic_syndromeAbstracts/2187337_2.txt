DNA samples from 76 patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes, including 10 cases with a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-), were examined for structural rearrangements of the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene. No abnormalities were detected, indicating that structural aberrations of this gene are not a feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes.
