A variety of reduced-intensity conditionings have been used in the reported studies of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for elderly patients with myeloid hematological malignancies. This study retrospectively analyzed the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for 10 patients aged 50 years or older with myeloid hematological malignancies after conditioning with fludarabine (125 mg/m(2)), melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) and total body irradiation (TBI; 8 Gy). Median age of the patients was 56.5 years, and diagnoses included acute myelogenous leukemia, advance myelodysplastic syndrome, and secondary myelofibrosis. Sources of stem cells were bone marrow from sibling (n=4) or unrelated donor (n=6). Both overall and disease-free survival rates were 40.0% (95% CI: 10.6~69.4%). Causes of death were relapse (n=2), fungal infection (n=2), and secondary malignancies (n=2). Because of a high incidence of transplant-related mortality, further refinement of this conditioning is required.
