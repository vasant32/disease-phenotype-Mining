Reduced-intensity conditioned (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved the accessibility of transplantation in patients previously ineligible. We report the results of allografting following conditioning with fludarabine, busulphan, and alemtuzumab in 62 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) (matched sibling donors [24] or volunteer unrelated donors [VUDs, 38]). The median age for sibling recipients was 56 years (range, 41-70 years) and for VUD recipients, 52 years (range, 22-65 years), with a median follow-up (survivors) of 524 days (range, 93-1392 days) and 420 days (range, 53-1495 days), respectively. The nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at days 100, 200, and 360 was 0%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, for siblings and 11%, 17%, and 21%, respectively, for VUD. The overall survival at one year was 73% for siblings and 71% for VUDs, with a disease-free survival (DFS) of 61% and 59%, respectively. The prognostic significance of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was preserved. Of recipients, 86% achieved full-donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence at day 100 of grades III to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) for VUD recipients was 9% and for sibling recipients, 0%. There were 26 patients (16 sibling and 10 VUD) who received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) at a median of 273 days (range, 126-1323 days). RIC allogeneic HSCT using this protocol appears to be safe and permits durable donor engraftment. Longer follow-up is required to confirm any potential survival advantage.
