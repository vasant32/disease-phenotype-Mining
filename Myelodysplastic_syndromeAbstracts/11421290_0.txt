A case of leukemia cutis (LC) of monocytic lineage in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is presented. Cutaneous infiltrates were recognized concurrent with diagnosis of refractory anemia (RA) with monocytosis. Skin infiltrates subsequently spontaneously regressed although MDS progressed with increasing monocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Death occurred 6 months after diagnosis with evolution of acute monoblastic leukemia complicated by sepsis. This case supports previous observations of poor prognosis associated with leukemia cutis. LC associated with MDS is reviewed including the role of monocytes.
