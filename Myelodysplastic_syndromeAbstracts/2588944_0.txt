Neutrophil-associated IgG (NAIgG) and neutrophil-binding IgG in sara (NBIgG) of 77 patients with neutropenia suspected to be caused by autoimmune mechanisms (group A) and 31 patients with aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (group B) were assayed by flow cytometry. Auto-NBIgG was elevated in 32% of the patients in group A, particularly in about 70% of those with collagen diseases or ITP, but the level was normal in group B. Elevated NAIgG with normal auto-NBIgG levels was found in 27% of the patients in group A and in 64% of the patients in group B. The assay of auto-NBIgG was useful for detection of anti-neutrophil autoantibodies and for the diagnosis of autoimmune neutropenia. In addition, the level of NAIgG may be non-specifically elevated in non-immune neutropenia.
