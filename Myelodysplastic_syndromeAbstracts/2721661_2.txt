In vitro megakaryocytic colony formation by progenitors from the bone marrow was studied in 40 myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Megakaryocytic colonies were decreased in number or absent in 30 patients; only 10 showed normal colony growth. The growth correlated to some extent with the FAB-class. Patients with normal colony formation had either RA or RARS, but also in these two FAB-types half of the patients showed reduced megakaryocytic colony formation. Only 1 out of 15 patients with RAEB or RAEBt had normal megakaryocyte growth. The patients with CMML did not show any megakaryocytic colonies. The growth of erythroid colonies was normal in 3 patients and reduced or absent in the others. All 3 with normal erythroid colony formation also showed normal megakaryocyte growth, and all patients with normal megakaryocyte colony formation also had normal granulocyte-macrophage colony growth. Granulocyte-macrophage colony and cluster formation was normal in 17 patients. Defective formation of megakaryocytic, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage colonies was seen in 22 patients, compatible with a defect in a pluripotent stem cell. Megakaryocytic colony formation had no obvious correlation with any specific chromosome abnormality, and the distribution of the growth patterns was almost similar in patients with a normal and those with an abnormal karyotype.
