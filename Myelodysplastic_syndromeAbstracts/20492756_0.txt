The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, encoded by the intronless CEBPA gene, is a transcription factor that induces expression of genes involved in differentiation of granulocytes, monocytes, adipocytes and hepatocytes. Both mono- and bi-allelic CEBPA mutations were detected in acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. In this study we also identified CEBPA mutations in healthy individuals and in patients with peripheral artery disease, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. We found 16 various deletions with the presence of two direct repeats in CEBPA by analysis of 431 individuals. Three most frequent repeats included in these deletions in CEBPA gene are CGCGAG (493- 498_865-870), GG (486-487_885-886), and GCCAAGCAGC (508-517_907-916), all according to GenBank Accession No. NM_004364.2. In one case we identified that a father with ischaemic heart disease and his healthy son had two identical deletions (493_864del and 508_906del, both according to GenBank Accession No. NM_004364.2) in CEBPA. The occurrence of deletions between two repetitive sequences may be caused by recombination events in the repair process. A double-stranded cut in DNA may initiate these recombination events in adjacent DNA sequences. Four types of polymorphisms in the CEBPA gene were also detected in the screened individuals. Polymorphism in CEBPA gene 690 G>T according to GenBank Accession No. NM_004364.2 is the most frequent type in our analysis. Statistical analysis did not find significant differences in the frequency of polymorphisms in CEBPA in patients and in healthy individuals with the exception of P4 polymorphism (580_585dup according to GenBank Accesion No. NM_004364.2). P4 polymorphism was significantly increased in ischaemic heart disease patients.
