Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) remain the first-line treatment of anemia in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without 5q deletion. A preliminary report suggested that adding all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to ESAs may improve their erythroid response, particularly in patients with high endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) level, and may improve other cytopenias. We conducted a prospective multicenter study of EPO-beta and ATRA in anemic MDS patients with marrow blasts <10% and either previous ESA failure or relapse, endogenous EPO >500 U/l or other cytopenia(s) (absolute neutrophilic count <1.0 G/l or platelets <50 G/l). A total of 59 patients were evaluable after 12 weeks of treatment. The erythroid response rates according to IWG 2000 and 2006 criteria, respectively, were as follows: overall: 49 and 36%; patients with previous ESA failure (n=28): 43 and 32%; patients with endogenous EPO >500 U/l (n=18): 11 and 19%; patients transfused >2 red blood cells units/month (n=28) 43 and 39%. Only one neutrophil, but no platelet response, and no major side effect were observed. EPO-beta-ATRA combination appears a possible therapeutic option in anemia of MDS having failed an ESA alone, but not in patients with high endogenous EPO level, and does not improve neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
