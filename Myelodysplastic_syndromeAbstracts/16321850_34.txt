Recent data suggest that myeloid neoplasms are organized hierarchically in terms of self-renewal and maturation of early progenitor cells, similar to normal myelopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the NOD/SCID mouse-repopulating leukemic stem cells usually co-express CD123 with CD34, but lack CD38. So far, however, little is known about expression of other markers and targets on these progenitors. In the present study, expression of target antigens on CD34+/CD38- cells was analysed by multi-color flow cytometry in patients with AML (n = 18), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 6), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 8) and systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 9). The IL-3Ralpha chain (CD123) was found to be expressed on CD34+/CD38- cells in a majority of the patients in all disease categories. Independent of the type of disease, the vast majority of these stem cells co-expressed aminopeptidase-N (CD13) and CD44 in all patients. By contrast, the CD34+/CD38- progenitor cells expressed variable amounts of the target receptor CD33, c-kit (CD117) and AC133 (CD133). In conclusion, neoplastic stem cells in various myeloid neoplasms appear to express a similar phenotype including target antigens such as CD13, CD33 and CD44. Since many of these targets are not expressed on all stem cells in all patients, the elimination of the entire clone may require combinations of targeted antibodies or use of additional drugs.
