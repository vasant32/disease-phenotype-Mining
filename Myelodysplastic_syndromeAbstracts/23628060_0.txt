Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) become dependent on blood transfusions and develop into transfusional iron overload, which is exacerbated by increased absorption of dietary iron in response to ineffective erythropoiesis. However, it is uncertain whether there is an association among iron accumulation, clinical complications, and decreased likelihood of survival in MDS patients. Thereby our current understanding of the effects of transfusion dependency and iron overload in MDS are discussed. Particular emphasis should be placed on further characterizing the role of redox-active forms of labile iron and oxidative stress in iron overload, decreased life expectancy and increased risk of leukemic transformation in MDS patients with iron overload.
