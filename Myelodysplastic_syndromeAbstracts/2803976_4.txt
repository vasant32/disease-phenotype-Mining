Abnormalities of chromosome 7 are among the most frequent cytogenetic aberrations found in MDS, including de novo cases and cases secondary to chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Since MET is located on 7q and as Cooper et al (1984) showed that MET proto-oncogene could be activated by a chemical carcinogen, we tried to evaluate whether it could be implicated in some cases of MDS. With specific probes for MET we analysed the DNA of 88 MDS patients (81 de novo and seven secondary cases). In 17 of them the RNA was also studied. We found no rearrangement or aberrant expression of MET in any samples studied. Our results, however, do not rule out point mutations or rearrangement of other regions of MET or adjacent DNA regions.
