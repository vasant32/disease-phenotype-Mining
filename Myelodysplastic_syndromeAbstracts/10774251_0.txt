A 73-year-old man was given a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome in October 1997. He was treated with red blood cell transfusion and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In February 1998, he was admitted due to progression of pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. The patient was treated with continuous-drip infusion of low-dose cytarabine and etoposide with G-CSF (AVG therapy). Complete remission (CR) was obtained after 2 courses of AVG therapy. Non-hematologic adverse effects were mild enough to be tolerated. CR has been maintained for 16 months with 1 course of consolidation therapy and 3 courses of intensification therapy using the AVG regimen.
