Monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against a part of v-myb gene product were prepared for the detection of human c-myb gene product (p75c-myb). Western blotting analyses with these McAbs were performed on human leukemia-lymphoma cells. All T-cell lines were positive in p75c-myb expression. B-cell lines were variable, myeloid and erythroid cells were positive although the amount of expressed p75c-myb was less than the T-cell lines. Cells isolated from patients were positive in expression except for cells from acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (AML M2), acute hypergranular promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3) and erythroleukemia (AML M6) developed from myelodysplastic syndromes. Differences in p75c-myb expression seemed to depend upon the differentiation stage and distinctive lineage from which each cell line had been established. The p75c-myb expression in HL60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line) showed remarkably high at logarithmic growth. When examined with HL60, p75c-myb expression significantly decreased during the differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or retinoic acid. These results suggest that p75c-myb expression plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation and that multiple mechanisms including aberrant expression of p75c-myb is involved in leukemogenesis.
