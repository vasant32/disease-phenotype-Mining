Twenty-one patients of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), aged 2 months to 57 years were analyzed. The common presenting feature was pallor (89%), fever (38%), Jaundice (43%) and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly was seen in 76% and 81% respectively. Fifteen cases were of idiopathic etiology and in 6 cases the etiology could be identified as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, pregnancy, maternal AIHA, typhoid fever and myelodysplastic syndrome (one each). Hemoglobin level ranged between 1.9 to 11.7 gm/dl (mean 6.8 gm/dl) and reticulocyte counts between 6% to 42% (mean (20.2%). Four patients had thrombocytopenia. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive in 19 and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) in 7 cases. There was no correlation between DAT positivity and severity of anemia. All patients had warm antibodies of IgG type. Ten of fourteen patients responded to steroid therapy. Patients with secondary AIHA had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to the idiopathic group.
