During 1988-1991, we have conducted cytogenetic analysis in 384 consecutive patients with suspected neoplastic haematological diseases. A total of 404 samples were evaluated with banding techniques; 66 patients had myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS); 64, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML); 50, acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL); 40, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); 39, lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD); 37, acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL); 31 with non-Hodgkin lymphomas; and 57 patients had benign disorders. The frequencies and the type of detected chromosomal abnormalities were, in most diagnostic groups, within the limits of previous reports. For lymphomas, LPD, and MPS these frequencies were lower than expected. 144 cases (44.8%) of the 295 de novo diagnosed cases showed structural rearrangements. Breakpoints involved in structural rearrangements cluster to 35 bands of the standard 650-banded karyotype. We have observed eight cases with new chromosomal rearrangements.
