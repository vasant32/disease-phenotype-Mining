The presence of transferrin receptors on erythroblasts in patients with iron deficiency, anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was studied by two-colour analysis on a flow cytometer. CD 71 was used to quantify the number of transferrin receptors and GLY-A to identify erythroblasts. In cases of iron deficiency, the number of transferrin receptors was increased on part of the erythroblasts thus facilitating iron uptake by the cells. In patients with ACD or MDS, a decrease of the number of transferrin receptors on erythroblasts was found. This leads to the conclusion that the ineffective response to iron therapy in cases of ACD and MSD can be explained by a decline of transferrin receptors on the red cells.
