Mutations in the human telomerase RNA gene (TERC) cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita and have been detected in individuals with bone marrow failure. Here, we screened for TERC mutations in a cohort of 80 children with hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome and detected TERC alterations in two of them.
