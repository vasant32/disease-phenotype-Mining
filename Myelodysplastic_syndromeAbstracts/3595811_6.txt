Cytogenetic studies were performed in 69 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes classified according to the FAB proposals. Overall incidence of chromosomal anomalies was 48% with 5q-, +8, 12p-,-7/7q- being the aberrations most often found. The 12p- chromosome showed a close correlation with a prior exposure to mutagenic agents and CMML. Although there were no group-specific cytogenetic anomalies, FAB classification strongly influenced their incidence. They were lower (36%) in RA/RA-S than in RAEB/RAEB-T/CMML (53%). Chromosomal anomalies were significantly more often found in patients with a prior exposure to carcinogenic agents (80%) than in unexposed patients (33%). The presence of chromosomal anomalies did not predict a higher risk of leukemic transformation.
