A case-control study of newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome patients investigated lifetime exposures through occupation, environment or hobby by questionnaire, structured and semi-structured interview. The exposure histories of 400 individually matched pairs were compared. Increased or possibly increased odds ratios were observed for radiation (2.05, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.76), halogenated organics (1.57, 0.97-2.57), metals (1.40, 0.99-2.00), several specific radiation exposures and individual chemicals and for childlessness (1.46, 1.01-2.11). Since myelodysplasia generally carries a poor prognosis, whether or not individuals convert to leukaemia or to other cancer, these findings add to previous reports of exposures implicated in the aetiology of leukaemia and add to the case for minimizing exposures to radiation and halogenated organics.
