Malakoplakia is a rare chronic disease with pleomorphic presentations. It involves many organs, particularly the urinary and gastro-intestinal tracts. It is less common on the skin. Lesions result from impaired phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages. Malakoplakia is sometimes related to immunodeficiencies. The diagnosis is usually made by histological examination. We report a case associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome.
