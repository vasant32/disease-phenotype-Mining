 OBJECTIVE: To analyse the outcome of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Twenty-three patients with MDS received G-CSF mobilized HLA-identical sibling allo-PBSCT. The numbers of mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34+ cells were 8. 25 (4.50 -22.36) x 10(8)/kg and 5.59 (1.57 - 12.22) x 10(6)/kg respectively. CsA and shorten course MTX were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and MMF was given on + 1 d - +28 d posttransplantation. RESULTS: Among 23 patients, 22 achieved hematopoietic recovery. The median time of ANC > 1.0 x 10(9)/L and BPC > 50 x 10(9)/L were + 13 (+ 11 - +17) days and + 30 (+13 + 102) days respectively. Two patients died of transplant related complications and three died of disease relapse, while 18 patients survived. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed disease free survival and relapse rate were (77.8 +/- 8.7)% and (14.4 +/- 7.5)% respectively. CONCLUSION: Allo-PBSCT is an effective treatment for MDS patients.
