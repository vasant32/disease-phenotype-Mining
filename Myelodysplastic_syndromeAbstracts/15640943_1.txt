The communication is summarizing results of study aimed to ascertain the efficacy of treatment with epoetin alpha in patients with different hematological disorders and, at the same time to evaluate the impact of this treatment on quality of their lives. Treatment efficacy in separate patients of the monitored population has been evaluated not only according to hemoglobin level increase, but also according to its effect on erythrocyte products consumption needed to control anemic syndrome. Overall 134 patients with different lymphoproliferative disorders were included in the evaluation. Full-extended monitoring, i.e. at least 3-month treatment with epoetin alpha, was passed by 127 (94.8%) patients. Favorable effect of epoetin alpha administration was most often reported in patients with multiple myeloma (85.7%), Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia (80%) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (76.7%). Conversely the lowest efficacy was reported in the group of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Administration of epoetin alpha within treatment of underlying anemia in numerous hematological disorders represents suitable alternative to the substitution therapy via erythrocyte transfusions. Approximately 75% of monitored patients showed improvement of life quality, in some cases irrespective of results of treatment of their underlying disorder.
