We hypothesized that reducing the dosage of prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) would reduce the risk of relapse and toxicity after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings. In a prospective phase II trial, 21 patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome underwent BMT from HLA-identical siblings and received GVHD prophylaxis consisting of low-dose (1.5 mg/kg per day) cyclosporin A (CSP) with short-term methotrexate (MTX) treatment. This low-dose group was compared with a group of retrospective control patients (n = 22) who received a standard CSP dosage (3.0 mg/kg per day) and MTX. One patient died of transplantation-related causes within 100 days. The regimen-related toxicity was quite tolerable. Although acute GVHD of grades II to III was more frequent in the low-dose group (47.6%) than in the control group (22.7%), the increase in acute GVHD did not significantly contribute to morbidity or mortality. There were no differences between the groups in the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD. The probabilities of relapse and survival of the groups were similar according to the risk for relapse at the time of transplantation. A prospective randomized study is required to determine whether low-dose or standard-dose CSP in combination with MTX is optimal for Japanese patients who undergo allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings.
