We describe treatment, outcomes and prognostic factors for patients who relapse following transplantation with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Seventy consecutive patients with high-risk myeloid malignancies underwent transplant and 25 (36%) relapsed, a median of 120 days later. The median percentage of bone marrow blasts at relapse was 24, the median donor chimerism was 73% and new karyotypic abnormalities occurred in 8 out of 20 (40%) evaluable patients. Twenty-one patients (84%) received aggressive treatment for relapse, including chemotherapy (60%), second hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; 52%) and/or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI; 12%). Thirteen achieved a complete response (CR) and four remain in CR. Median overall survival (OS) after relapse was 6 months (95% confidence interval=2.7-9.9 months), and actuarial 1 year OS was 24%. Most deaths were due to disease progression (17/20, 85%). We did not observe an advantage for cellular therapy (DLI or second transplant) compared to chemotherapy. Salvage therapy for relapse after reduced intensity HCT is feasible, associated with low treatment-related mortality, and may result in prolonged survival in select patients. Studies exploring the optimal treatment for relapse following reduced intensity HCT are warranted.
