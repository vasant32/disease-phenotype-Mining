OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and rheumatic manifestations associated with chronic haematological malignancies. METHODS: Two groups of patients were prospectively studied (group I: 60 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and group II: 140 patients with lymphoid malignancies) for clinical 'immune' manifestations and ANCA. RESULTS: In the myelodysplastic group, six patients had ANCA-negative systemic medium-size vasculitis, one had systemic vasculitis with cytoplasmic ANCA, one relapsing polychondritis, one giant cell arteritis, one polymyalgia rheumatica, one polyarthritis and two fasciitis. In group II, two patients had ANCA-negative systemic vasculitis, two had leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with tuberculosis, two had polyarthritis, one polymyalgia rheumatica and one giant cell arteritis. Six sera were ANCA-positive with perinuclear pattern in four cases, atypical pattern in one and cytoplasmic pattern in one. Two sera had anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) specificity, and others had no known specificity; none had anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) specificity. Global prevalence of ANCA in our cohort was 3%, similar to the French general population. CONCLUSION: Polyarteritis nodosa-type systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica were the most frequent findings (18%) in myelodysplastic syndromes and particularly in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. ANCA were not helpful for the diagnosis of vasculitis. Vasculitis associated with infection, in particular tuberculosis, must be ruled out.
