Excluding chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a total of 92 consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndrome showing less than 20% blasts in the bone marrow were analyzed. We evaluated the clinical significance of the WHO and MDS 2000 classifications by reviewing each MDS patient according to the classification. The WHO criteria classified the MDS patients into 36 with RA, 22 with RCMD and 33 with RAEB, whereas according to the MDS 2000 criteria there were 19 RAEB-I patients and 15 RAEB-II patients. Based on the WHO classification, the RCMD patients had higher platelet counts and percentages of blasts among BM cells than the RA patients (P = 0.0018, P = 0.0001). Twenty percent of the RA patients, 44.8% of the RCMD patients, and 70.8% of the RAEB patients had cytogenetic abnormalities. Among them, the poor karyotype was present in 6.7% of the RA patients, 21.0% of the RCMD patients and 41.6% of the RAEB patients. The rate of acute leukemia death was 14.3% in the RA patients, 67.7% in the RAEB patients and 50.0% in the RCMD patients. Analysis of survival times revealed significant differences between RA and RCMD patients (P = 0.0482). The clinical features of RCMD patients were intermediate between those of RAEB and RA patients. There was no difference between the clinical features of the RAEB-I and RAEB-II patients in the MDS 2000 classification.
