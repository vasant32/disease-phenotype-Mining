To assess the clinical value of determination of the interferon (IFN)-producing capacity of patients, IFN production induced by Sendai virus (HVJ) in vitro was measured in cell cultures of whole blood from patients with various diseases. IFN production in patients with lung cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, pulmonary tuberculosis, and asymptomatic HIV-1 infection was lower than that in healthy persons. Furthermore, periodic measurements of IFN production revealed decreasing IFN producing capacities in patients with lung cancer with progression of the tumor stage. However, increased IFN-producing capacities were observed in patients with tuberculosis after standard therapy. Further experiments showed that the main type of IFN induced in whole blood cultures was IFN-alpha, and decreased IFN production in patients did not result from a decreased number of leukocytes but rather from an impairment of cellular IFN production. The evaluation of IFN production in whole blood cell cultures may be a feasible method of assessing the impaired immune status.
