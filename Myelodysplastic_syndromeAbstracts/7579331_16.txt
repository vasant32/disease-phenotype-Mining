Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) form a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders with unfavourable prognosis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment, but remains limited to a small subgroup of younger patients with HLA-compatible donors. As autologous stem cell transplantation is currently being explored as an alternative treatment strategy for MDS, more information needs to be acquired regarding the clonal nature of the progenitor cells in these autografts. Therefore, we have analyzed the clonal patterns of highly purified hematopoietic progenitors and their mature daughter cells in mobilized peripheral blood collections produced from five female patients with high-risk MDS in complete hematologic remission. X-chromosome activation patterns of flow-sorted immature (CD34 + 38low, CD34 + 33low) and committed (CD34 + 38high, CD34 + 33high) progenitors were studied with the polymerase chain reaction-based HUMARA assay. In four patients, a polyclonal remission was shown in all stem cell subpopulations and their mature daughter cells whereas one patient was found to remain skewed in all fractions, except T lymphocytes. This study provides strong evidence that polyclonal immature hematopoietic progenitors can be mobilized and harvested in patients high-risk MDS after treatment with high-dose chemotherapy.
