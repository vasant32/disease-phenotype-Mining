High serum concentrations of procalcitonin (PCT) have been found during bacterial and parasitic infections. This is a report of two cases of disseminated aspergillosis with moderate PCT increase in two 14-year-old girls after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for myelodysplastic syndrome and Fanconi's anemia, respectively. In contrast, the important rise of serum CRP observed in these patients tends to demonstrate that the synthesis of these two proteins is under different control mechanisms.
