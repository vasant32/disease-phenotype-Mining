A 39-year-old woman received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her daughter for secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. On day +12, a cough and fever developed. Chest X-ray and computed tomography demonstrated a consolidation in the left lung. A diagnosis of pulmonary zygomycosis was made on the histology from a transbronchial lung biopsy. Although amphotericin B (AMPH-B) showed efficacy, dose reduction was necessary because of renal toxicity. The patient died of pulmonary zygomycosis, confirmed by an autopsy. We strongly hope for authorization as soon as possible of the use of such a drug as liposomal AMPH-B which appears less toxic.
