 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the WHO classification, clinical and hematological features and risk group of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: The diagnosis and classification of MDS patients were defined according to the WHO classification. The clinical manifestations, hemogram, bone marrow biopsy and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of MDS was 47 yrs being younger than that in some foreign reports. The frequency of abnormal karyotype was 35.14% and +8 was the most frequent abnormal karyotype in our study. Eleven of 74 patients transformed into leukemia. Univariate analysis showed that age, chromosome abnormality, percentage of bone marrow blast cells and number of cytopenias were significantly related to prognosis. There was a statistical difference in cum survival rate between IPSS subcategories (P < 0.05) except that between low- and intermediate I-risk subcategory (P > 0.05). There were statistical differences for refractory anemia (RA) vs RA with excess blast (RAEB), refractory cytopenias with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) vs RAEB and RAEB-I vs RAEB-II (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in age of disease onset, distribution of WHO, sub-classification and abnormal karyotype in this cohort of MDS patients as compared with those in Europe and Japan. It is helpful in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis to divide RAEB into RAEB-I and RAEB-II. IPSS was well applicable in Chinese MDS patients.
