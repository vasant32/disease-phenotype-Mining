Three cases of t(11;21)(q24;q11.2) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) showed karyotypic evolution resulting in the presence of two der(11)t(11;21) without normal chromosome 11 and with partial trisomy 21q. In one of these, we performed further molecular cytogenetic investigations which showed 1) that this rearrangement led to changes in the dosage and location of both c-ets 1 and c-ets 2 protooncogenes; and 2) that the presence of two 11q + chromosomes did not result from a nondisjunction, but that a second chromosome rearrangement had occurred. The final genetic imbalance resulting from this cytogenetic change involves at least hemizygosity for some sequences on the long arm of chromosome 11, including c-ets 1, plus trisomy for the most part of the long arm of chromosome 21, including c-ets 2.
