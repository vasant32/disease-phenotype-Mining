 OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of SHP-1 promoter methylation on the pathogenesis and progression in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and its related mechanism. METHODS: 63 MDS patients were divided into low-grade (LG) group and high-grade (HG) group according to IPSS score system. Bone marrow samples were collected. Methylation specific-PCR (MSP) were used to detect the status of SHP-1 promoter methylation in bone marrow (BM) samples from different risk MDS patients and MDS cell line, SKK-1. Western blot was used to detect signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT3) activation in SKK-1 cell line and MDS patients. RESULTS: No SHP-1 promoter methylation could be detected in healthy controls BM. Partially methylation was found in SKK-1 cell line. Methylation rate of SHP-1 gene promoter was found in BM of 24.2% of low-grade MDS patients and 63.3% of high-grade MDS patients, the difference between these two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05); Patients were divided into different groups according to WHO subtype, chromosomal karyotype and blast cells in bone marrow, methylation rates of SHP-1 were significantly higher in RAEB-II, poor karyotype group and samples with 0.11-0.19 blast cells (P < 0.05); The phosphorylation protein of STAT3 was detected in SKK-1 cell line. The expression of phosphorylation STAT3 was significantly higher in HG group than in LG group (66.7% vs 18.2%) (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between SHP-1 promoter methylation and STAT3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Abnormal methylation of SHP-1 gene promoter might have tentative role in the pathogenesis and progression of MDS, which may be involved in STAT3 activation. Detection of SHP-1 promoter methylation may be helpful to evaluate the prognosis of MDS.
