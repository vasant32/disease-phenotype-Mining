The study describes progression of refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) of 3 years' duration to B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Development of ALL in this patient was preceded by the deterioration of dyserythropoiesis, leukopenia and an increase of blasts in the bone marrow. Our case may represent an additional evidence to the hypothesis that a primary pathogenetic lesion in myelodysplastic syndrome occurs at the level of the pluripotent stem cell.
