Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) is extremely rare in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) despite extensive use of alkylating agents. We present a case of heavily treated CLL with resultant therapy-related refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). A complex cytogenetic abnormality including involvement of 3q21 was detected and to our knowledge, is the first report of a RARS case with a 3q21 abnormality.
