Automated plasmapheresis with Haemonetics-Ultralite plasma collecting system was tested to prepare platelet-rich plasma. 19 patients with bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia received 112 platelet-rich plasma. The efficiency of platelet transfusions was determined by corrected count increment (CCI) and resonance thrombography in correlation to the clinical situation of patients. Fever and chemotherapy did not impair the values 1 h after transfusion, but the 24-hour CCI showed a reduced survival of the transfused platelets in this group. The CCI was 11.3 1 h after transfusion and 9.5 1 day after transfusion in the patient group without any factor reducing the efficiency of transfusion. In this group, the resonance thrombography significantly improved 1 and 24 h posttransfusion compared to pretransfusion. The results demonstrate an acceptable clinical efficiency of platelet-rich plasma.
