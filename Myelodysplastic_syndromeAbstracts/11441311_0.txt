 BACKGROUND: Long-term results are needed to evaluate chemotherapy regimens and prognostic factors in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). We report the 10-year follow-up data of aggressive NHL classified according to the Kiel classification and treated with MACOP-B. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1991, 71 patients with aggressive NHL were treated in a single institution with MACOP-B and adjuvant radiotherapy as first-line therapy. NHL subtypes were classified according to the updated Kiel classification. Follow-up data were available until 1998. RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) at 10 years is 45% (confidence interval 33-57%), the progression-free survival 42% (30-54%), and the relapse-free survival of the 59 patients (82%) in complete remission is 52% (39-65%). The Kiel classification combined with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) identified diffuse large B-cell and anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas with IPI 0-2 as subgroups with very favorable prognosis after MACOP-B (OS 84% and 80% at 10 years). Late relapses (>2 years after therapy) did occur in these patients but had a good prognosis after second remission. Only 3 of 24 relapses were in the radiation field. Three patients died of toxicity, 1 during MACOP-B (1.3%). Risk factors for therapy-related death were age and pulmonary toxicity. Most patients suffered from chemotherapy-associated mucositis. Osteoporosis was a common late toxicity (39%). Three second cancers but no leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes were observed during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MACOP-B in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy is highly effective in diffuse large B-cell or anaplastic large T-cell-lymphomas with IPI 0-2. Patients with IPI >2 or with centrocytic or secondary centroblastic B-cell or non-anaplastic T-cell lymphomas need more intensive therapy or novel approaches. Regarding the toxicity profile, MACOP-B should be replaced by VACOP-B.
