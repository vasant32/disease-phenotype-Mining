Monoclonal antibody QBEND10 is reactive with the CD34 antigen in aldehyde-fixed, decalcified, paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies. In normal bone marrow it stained endothelial cells lining arterioles and capillaries, sinusoidal (littoral) cells and 0.89% of all haemopoietic cells. QBEND10+ mononuclear cells were seen as isolated, randomly distributed mononuclear cells in normal and regenerating bone marrows. Conversely, QBEND10+ cells were increased and present in aggregates of three or more cells in 6/8 cases of acute leukemia; in two cases of CD34-negative leukemia and in two patients after complete remission no aggregates were seen. QBEND10 immunohistochemistry may therefore be useful for diagnosis and follow-up of myeloid leukemias. In addition, increased numbers of CD34+ cells arranged in clusters were seen in 4/9 cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 1 case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 3/3 cases of RAEB in transformation, and in 3/7 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia: in all these cases, CD34 staining of the bone biopsy may have prognostic value. QBEND10+ endothelial cells were significantly increased in all the pathological conditions examined (1.43% of all nucleated cells versus 0.80% in normal bone marrow; p = 0.0063), but especially in myeloid leukemias and in two fibrotic syndromes examined.
