Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered subcutaneously to 10 patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) who had haemoglobin concentrations less than 10 g/dl, in an attempt to relieve their anaemia. Doses of 60 units/kg/d rising to 90 units/kg/d were given over a maximum period of 16 weeks. Two out of 10 patients showed a steady rise in haemoglobin concentration during treatment. One patient with refractory anaemia had a sustained rise from 9.9 g/dl to 11.3 g/dl, and one patient with refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) had a rise from 9.5 g/dl to 11.4 g/dl but then relapsed with the development of an iron deficient state. Serum concentrations of immunoreactive EPO varied considerably between patients, but both responders had relatively low baseline levels. Both responders were also new diagnoses and had received no red cell transfusions. The criteria for response to recombinant human erythropoietin therapy, as well as the indications for therapy remain to be clarified.
