A 31-yr-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presented with initial symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. Cytogenetics revealed monosomy 7 and translocation (3;3)(q21;q26). The initial symptoms, in conjunction with a low serum level of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings demonstrating loss of the "bright spot" of the neurohypophysis, indicated diabetes insipidus (DI), e.g. caused by leukemic infiltration of the neurohypophysis. After induction chemotherapy the patient's bone marrow revealed blast persistence, and following a second course of chemotherapy and normalisation of MRI, an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from the patient's HLA-identical brother was performed, resulting in ongoing complete remission. Recently, Lavabre-Bertrand et al. reported an association of AML with DI, elevated platelet counts, and monosomy 7 and chromosome 3 abnormalities in three patients (Eur. J. Haematol. 2001: 66: 66-69). Our report of an MDS with trilineage dysplasia and these karyotypic changes associated with DI indicates that this new entity may also include preleukemic cases.
