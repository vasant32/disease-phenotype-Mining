The administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be complicated by the emergence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, frequently determining hospital admission and intravenous treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. Frequently, it is necessary to reduce the dose or to delay the administration of the cytotoxic drugs reducing the relative dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen. Granulocyte growth factors stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils and reduce the number of days of severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. They are also indicated for the collection of hematopoietic progenitors for autologous and allogeneic transplantation, as well as in non malignant diseases associated with chronic neutropenia. This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of granulocyte growth factors in Hematology.
