OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of erythropoietin use in hematologic patients; to analyze the extent to which recommendations are applied as provided by Spanish prescribing information, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines, as well as specific recommendations for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), and to perform a descriptive analysis of costs. METHOD: A descriptive retrospective study. Patient selection was performed by Unidad de Atención Farmacéutica a Pacientes Externos (UFPE: Pharmaceutical Outpatient Care Unit) during a 3-month period of time. Follow-up was performed to month 9 after selection. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (37% males) were included. In the group of patients with multiple myeloma and lymphomas, effectiveness was 57%; while in the MDS group it was 45-64% (depending on criteria used to measure erythroid response). Of all 24 patients (MDSs excluded) only 4 (17%) met indication criteria--adjustment to erythroid response at 4 and 8 weeks, and dosage titration when needed. Continued treatment with erythropoietin in all non-responders amounted to 59-69% of total expense for non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high percentage of therapy failures and inconsistency between erythropoietin use recommendations and clinical practice. This circumstance, as well as the high financial impact it entails, makes it essential that monitoring and follow-up strategies are implemented to contribute to an optimal usage of erythropoiesis stimulating factors.
