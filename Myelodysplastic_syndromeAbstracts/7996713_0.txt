The experiments have been undertaken whether DNA contents could be measured using whole blood lysis method by FACScan. Cell population in the phases of G1, S and G2 + M were well analyzed, when we used 3 x 10(6) cells lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline, staining with 30 micrograms/ml of propidium iodide (PI) within 30 min after staining with PI. We have further developed cell cycle analysis for cells bearing lineage specific antigens recognized with FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies using two color analysis. When we fixed cells with 50% ice-cold ethanol after staining cells with FITC-conjugated antibodies, positive population ratio in these cells have been unchanged before and after fixing for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8. CD10, CD19, CD14, CD33, and HLA-DR, but CD7 positive cells were markedly decreased after fixing. Using this method, CD41 positive leukemia cells have 3.4% in S phase and 6.8% in G2 + M phase, while CD41 negative cells have 1.8% in S phase and 2.0% in G2 + M phase in a patient with AML: M7, resulting leukemia cells were rich in S phase and G2 + M phase. The similar results were obtained in patients with AML:M2 using CD33 antibodies. During the clinical course, the changes of the blast numbers were well-correlated with changes of S-phase proportion in the patient with AML:M2. Among 47 patients with hematological malignancies in our hospital tested here, only 2 cases with 4.3% of total patients showed to have aneuploidy in malignant cells. One is a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the other is myelodysplastic syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
