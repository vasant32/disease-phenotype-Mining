Deferasirox is a new oral iron chelator used to treat transfusional iron overload. We describe a case of a 79-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed esophagitis induced by deferasirox. He repeatedly received multiple red blood cell transfusions after a diagnosis of MDS. Two years after starting red blood cell transfusions, he was diagnosed with iron overload, and was then started on deferasirox at 1 g/day with about 400 ml of water. He was admitted to our institution because he was unable to swallow his own saliva 1 month after starting deferasirox. Esophagogastroendoscopy revealed white-coated mucosa covering the entire esophagus. A component analysis of biopsy specimens using high-performance liquid chromatography identified deferasirox. Symptoms resolved within about 2 weeks after discontinuing deferasirox, and repeated endoscopy showed marked improvement of esophagitis after 1 month. Re-administration of deferasirox was not attempted. Unfortunately, the patient died due to pneumonia 6 months after administration of deferasirox was started. This is the first report of drug-induced esophagitis associated with deferasirox.
