Pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) can stimulate megakaryopoiesis in vitro in some myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. We assessed PEG-rHuMGDF combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL6, stem cell factor (SCF) or erythropoietin in 40 MDS, 33 AML and 16 normal bone marrow samples. CD61-positive cells in suspension cultures increased with PEG-rHuMGDF alone in 20/25 RA + RAS, 11/14 RAEB + RAEBt and 29/33 AML cases. Further increases when IL-3 and/or SCF were added to PEG-rHuMGDF occurred in 14/20 RA + RAS, 8/13 RAEB + RAEBt and 18/26 AML cases. CFU-Mk growth was poor overall, but could be enhanced by PEG-rHuMGDF combinations in some patients. Stimulation of megakaryopoiesis by PEG-rHuMGDF can be augmented by IL-3 and SCF in many MDS and AML patients.
