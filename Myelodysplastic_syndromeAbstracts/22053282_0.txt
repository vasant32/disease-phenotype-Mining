NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in AML and the role of the NPM1 mutant in acute myeloid leukemia along with its leukemogenic potential are still under investigation.NPM1 genetic alterations can contribute to leukemogenesis through the direct oncogenic effect of the mutant protein and the concomitant loss of one functional allele. Npm1 loss determines tumor development in the mouse while in human NPM1 maps in a chromosomal region frequently loss in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The NPM1 mutant cytoplasmic delocalization in leukemic blasts alters multiple cellular pathways through either loss or gain of function effects on different protein partners.Here we discuss the most relevant studies on the role of the NPM1 molecule in hematological malignancies and both in vitro and in vivo studies that are trying to elucidate the way by which the NPM1 mutation induces leukemia.
