Sixty children with MDS treated in six centres of the Polish Paediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group in the period 1975-1999 were included in the study. In 20 children RAEB-T, in 13 RA, in 21 RAEB and in 6 CMML were diagnosed. Our own and literature data showed that BMT is the best therapy for children with MDS. We need a new comprehensive protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of children with MDS in Poland.
