The serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6) are known to be elevated in two diseases of the elderly age, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Authors suppose that one of the possible causes of this elevation could be a difference between these patients and healthy subjects in the frequency of polymorphic variants of the genes regulating IL6 levels. Scarce and contradictory comparative data are available for MM and to our best knowledge this is the first study on IL6 promoter and IL6 receptor (IL6R) polymorphism in MDS. Therefore we determined the Asp358Ala polymorphism of the IL6 receptor gene and the -174 G>C promoter polymorphism of the IL6 gene in blood samples of 102 MDS and 100 MM patients and 99 age- and sex-matched hospitalized controls had been tested for this purpose as well. There was no significant difference between patients with either disease and controls regarding IL6 promoter/L-6R. Authors therefore assume other mechanisms causing high IL6 levels are not related to either of these polymorphisms. Moreover authors consider important to propose a hypothesis how elements of signal transduction in iron metabolism might be involved in the development of MM and MDS in elderly age.
