A patient with grade II endometrial adenocarcinoma underwent TAH/BSO. The tumor penetrated 50% of the myometrium. A lesion from the serosa of the sigmoid colon was removed and contained metastatic adenocarcinoma. Metastatic tumor was also found in the common iliac lymph nodes. Postoperatively the patient was treated with abdominopelvic radiotherapy to 30 Gy. The pelvis was boosted to a dose of 46.2 Gy. The vaginal apex was then treated with three applications of high-dose-rate brachytherapy to a total dose of 12 Gy. The patient was doing well with no evidence of recurrence 52 months following treatment when she was diagnosed with a myelodysplastic syndrome. Cytogenetic analysis revealed aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 7, which is highly suggestive of a treatment-related process. Myelodysplasia induced by radiotherapy alone is an unusual but recognized event.
