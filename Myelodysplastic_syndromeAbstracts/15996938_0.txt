A human myeloid cell line with trisomy 8 was newly established from overt myelogenous leukemia arising in myelodysplastic syndrome. The cells of this cell line showed immature myelocyte characteristics. The karyotype retained trisomy 8. This cell line could improve understanding of the pathophysiology of myelogenous leukemia with trisomy 8.
