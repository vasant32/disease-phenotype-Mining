Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are frequently used pharmacotherapeutics for type II diabetes mellitus, which exert their effect through peroxisomal proliferator agonist receptor (PPAR) mediated increased insulin sensitivity. TZDs are known to cause marrow suppression and to stimulate adipogenesis. Case and cohort studies show TZDs worsen thyroid-associated orbitopathy. We present a case consistent with earlier reports of marrow suppressive pancytopenia manifesting as myelodysplastic syndrome, a new implication of hypoerythropoetinemia, and non-Graves'-associated proliferative proptosis.
