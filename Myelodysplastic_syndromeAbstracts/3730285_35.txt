Fifteen patients with the initial diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) received aggressive chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine or with a standard acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) regime. Cases treated with aggressive chemotherapy were either younger individuals with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or patients, irrespective of age in advanced stages of MDS (RAEB in transformation or after evolution to frank AML), who did not have a major infection at the time of presentation. Age seemed to be the most important factor in determining the outcome of aggressive remission induction chemotherapy in MDS: 86% of the patients less than 50 years entered complete remission, compared to only 25% in the older age group. In spite of intensive consolidation therapy the duration of complete remission was short. We conclude that young patients (less than 50 years) with excess of bone marrow blasts should be treated with aggressive chemotherapy even in the early stages of the disease. Elderly patients in advanced stages of MDS should be treated with less aggressive chemotherapy.
