We report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with unusual abnormal 99mTc-MDP activity throughout both lungs on whole-body bone scan. To explain the pancytopenia, bone marrow examination was carried out which showed hypocellularity in addition to large abnormal megakaryocytes indicating myelodysplastic changes. His whole-body bone scan showed increased 99mTc-MDP activity in both lungs, kidneys, and also along the proximal two thirds of the femora. It was concluded that lung uptake in addition to skeletal uptake on scintigraphic bone scanning should be kept in mind in patients with MDS.
