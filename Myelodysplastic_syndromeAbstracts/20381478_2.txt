Long-term exposure to benzene can potentially result in severe haematotoxicities, including pancytopaenia, aplastic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which are often accompanied by life-threatening symptoms and high mortality. Previous studies demonstrate that benzene-induced haematotoxicities are immune-mediated and that cyclosporin A is a prominent treatment in acquired aplastic anaemia. This study aims to evaluate the potential role of cyclosporin A immunosuppressive therapy for severe benzene-induced haematotoxicity. Between January 2002 and December 2008, 41 patients with severe benzene-induced haematopoietic disorders from five hospitals were enrolled in the study, 22 patients received cyclosporin A, supportive treatments and/or oral testosterone undecanoate, 19 patients were treated with supportive treatments and/or oral testosterone undecanoate as the control group, and a 6-month follow-up was conducted. The results showed that in the cyclosporin A group, 19 of 22 patients (86.36%) had responded to the treatments completely or partially with increased platelets, white blood cells and hemoglobulin counts by the fourth week (P=0.005), the sixth week (P=0.001) and the third month post-treatment (P=0.034), respectively. However, in the control group treated by supportive methods, only 5 of 19 patients (26.32%) responded to the treatments partially (P<0.001). Cyclosporin A in conjunction with supportive treatments may be an effective treatment modality for patients with severe benzene-induced haematopoietic disorders, which in turn implies that these haematotoxicities are immune-mediated.
