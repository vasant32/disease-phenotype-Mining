The impact of the CD34+ cell dose on chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and the clinical outcome was analyzed in 41 consecutive adult patients submitted to allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical siblings. The patients were classified into 'low' or 'high' CD34+ cell dose groups based on whether they received less or more than a median CD34+ cell dose of 10.5 x 10(6)/kg, respectively. There was a significant difference in the incidence of extensive cGVHD (low vs high group, 25.0 vs 66.7%, P=0.021) and relapse (47.6 vs 20.0%, P=0.049) between the two groups. With a median follow-up of 335 days, the 3-year survival estimate for the whole population was 47.9%, while that for the low and high groups was 29.9 and 67.8%, respectively (P=0.0434). An inverse relation was noted between the relapse rate and the incidence of extensive cGVHD (P=0.043). It would appear reasonable that the optimal dose of CD34+ cells should be determined based on the disease status or aggressiveness of the malignant cells in each patient. Yet, in the case of patients with a high risk of relapse, transplantation with a CD34+ cell dose of >10.5 x 10(6)/kg would seem to be acceptable to minimize the risk of relapse.
