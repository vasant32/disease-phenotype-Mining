Cytology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis have specific roles in the diagnosis and management of various haematological neoplasms. Careful examination of Romanowsky-stained films of blood and bone marrow is fundamental in all haematological diagnosis and, when considered together with clinical and haematological features, indicates which of the more specialized techniques are most likely to be useful. The major role of cytochemistry is in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes. The major role of immunophenotyping is in the diagnosis of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and of acute leukaemia which is not obviously myeloid. Cytogenetic analysis has a role in confirming the diagnosis of chronic granulocytic leukaemia and gives important supplementary information in the acute leukaemias and the myelodysplastic syndromes.
