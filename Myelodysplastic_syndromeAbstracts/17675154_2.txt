Several phenotypic abnormalities of bone marrow (BM) hemopoietic precursors have been associated with disease progression in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We analyzed the influence on overall survival of the expression of lineage and maturation-associated antigens of BM hemopoietic cells quantified in a previous study. In the univariate Cox regression the peripheral platelet count was a significant favourable factor for overall survival. Unfavorable prognostic factors were: WPSS, increase in BM CD34+ cells, increased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD13 on myelocytes, metamyelocytes and mature neutrophils as well as increased CD45 of myelocytes and mature neutrophils. In a model containing platelet count, WPSS and MFI of CD45 and CD13 on mature neutrophils, only hyperexpression of CD13 and degree of thrombocytopenia were independent risk factors. Therefore, phenotypic features that can also be obtained from PB might be useful for predicting survival in MDS.
