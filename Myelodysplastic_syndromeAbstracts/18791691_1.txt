Good syndrome (GS) is a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency disease characterised by hypogammaglobulinaemia and thymoma. Here we describe a 72-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with GS when he was 62, after a two-year history of recurrent respiratory infections. A chest CT scan showed a mediastinal mass which was surgically removed; its histology revealed a thymoma. The patient was hypogammaglobulinaemic and his clinical condition dramatically improved after starting an appropriate dosage of IVIG. Two years ago he developed a normochromic normocytic anaemia requiring several transfusions. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient started cyclosporine and the anaemia gradually improved, achieving transfusion independence.
