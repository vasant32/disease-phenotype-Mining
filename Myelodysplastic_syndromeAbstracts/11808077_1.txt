Human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) infection is known to frequently induce aplastic crisis in patients with hemolytic anemia, but rarely causes hematological disorders in healthy subjects. We report a 5-year-old boy who showed transient myelodysplasia associated with HPV-B19 infection. He was admitted with severe nasal bleeding, and laboratory data showed marked thrombocytopenia (1,000/microliter), anemia (Hb: 8.4 g/dl), and mild leukopenia (3,000/microliter). A bone marrow smear revealed myelodysplastic changes in three cell lineages, but no giant proerythroblasts or megakaryocytes. The pancytopenia and myelodysplastic changes were resolved spontaneously within a week without any medication other than transfusion of red blood cells and platelets. Serological examination revealed an elevation of IgG antibody against HPV-B19 on days 15 and 120 and its subsequent decrease thereafter, although HPV-B19-specific DNA was not detected in the serum at onset. The clinical course and laboratory data suggest an etiologic role of HPV-B19 infection in the occurrence of transient myelodysplasia.
