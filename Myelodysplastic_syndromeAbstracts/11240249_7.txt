PURPOSE: This study was performed to retrospectively assess the potential influence of total-body irradiation (TBI) dose on overall survival in patients undergoing allogeneic bone-marrow transplants (BMT) for hematologic malignancies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1984 and December 1996, 116 patients were conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy and fractionated TBI before allogeneic BMT. The median age was 34 years (range 3-60). The TBI dose was given in 6 fractions, twice-a-day, over 3 days before BMT. The total dose was 10 Gy in 24 patients, 12 Gy in 66 patients, and 13.5 Gy in 26 patients. RESULTS: TBI dose was inversely correlated with overall survival. Five-year survival was 62% for patients conditioned with 10 Gy, 55% for patients conditioned with 12 Gy, and 46% for patients conditioned with 13.5 Gy. Age at BMT was also independently correlated with survival, with the best outcome for patients < 40 years old. CONCLUSION: A TBI dose (fractionated) > 10 Gy may not necessarily be associated with a better outcome in patients undergoing allogeneic bone-marrow transplant for hematologic malignancies.
