OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficiency and side-effects of the combination of cyclosporine A (CsA) and thalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: A total of thirty-seven patients with MDS-RCMD or-RAEB-I were treated with CsA in combination with thalidomide. The initial CsA dose of 3 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1) was administered, all patients had their CsA blood concentration concurrently monitored until it reached and maintained between 100 and 200 µg/L. The initial dose of thalidomide was 50 mg/d, with increasing dose of 50 mg every week until the maximum of 200 mg/d. The hematological response was assessed according to the modified criteria of the International Working Group, and adverse events were graded with the Common Toxicity Criteria (v3.0) of the National Cancer Institute. The response duration and overall survival of the patients were also observed. RESULTS: 19/37 cases (51.4%) achieved hematologic improvement (HI)-erythroid response (HI-E), 9/29 cases (31.0%) HI-platelet response (HI-P) and 7/33 cases (21.2%) HI-neutrophil response (HI-N). 15 of 32 transfusion-dependent patients (46.9%) achieved transfusion independence. The median response duration of HI-E, HI-P and HI-N were 88 (4 - 88) weeks, 78 (8 - 84(+)) weeks and 78 (10 - 84(+)) weeks respectively. The median overall survival was 52 months on a 29 (4 - 103) months median follow-up. Some patients developed grades I-II hepatic or nephritic impairment, constipation, lethargy, dizziness, edema, rashes or numbness, and all were tolerable and reversible. No grade III or severer adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: CsA in combination with thalidomide appears to be effective mainly in inducing HI-E and relatively well-tolerated for the treatment of patients with MDS.
