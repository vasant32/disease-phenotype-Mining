Mucorales (subphylum Mucoromycotina) are well-known agents of invasive mucormycosis, whereas Entomophthorales (subphylum Entomophthoromycotina) are rarely encountered in human diseases in temperate zones. Here we report a fatal case of invasive rhino-orbitocerebral entomophthoramycosis caused by Conidiobolus incongruus in a 78-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome.
