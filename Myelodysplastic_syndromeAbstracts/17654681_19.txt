The method of cardiovascular T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows in vivo estimation of iron in the heart and liver and was used to measure the degree of iron overload in 10 transfused MDS patients (average 90 blood units) and in 3 patients with congenital hemolytic anemia. In all MDS patients iron overload was found in the liver but not in the heart. Patients with congenital anemias had iron in both organs despite iron chelation. It is possible that in MDS more time and more transfusions are required to induce iron accumulation in the myocardium. Therefore, cardiac MRI may serve as a diagnostic tool to assess if and when iron chelation is indicated.
