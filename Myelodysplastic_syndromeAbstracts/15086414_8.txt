We report on seven patients with myeloid diseases characterized by i(20q-) anomaly. Four patients were male and three were female, their median age was 57 years. The diagnosis at presentation was myelodysplastic syndrome in six patients, acute myeloid leukaemia in one patient. Four died but three survived and remain anaemic. The survivals were 6 months for patient 1, 7 months for patient 2, 17 d for patient 4 and 28 d for patient 5. Chromosome specimens were prepared by direct and/or short-term culture of bone marrow cells. Karyotype analysis was performed by R- and G-banding technique, which showed that one of the normal chromosomes 20 was substituted by one or two small metacentric chromosomes in all seven patients. The karyotype was ider(20)(q10)del(20)(q11q13), i.e. i(20q-) in six patients by dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using two probes (a subtelomeric probe for 20q and an unique probe for 20q12). As far as we know, this anomaly has not been reported previously. Thus, we consider that i(20q-) is a novel and rare recurrent chromosomal abnormality that is specifically associated with myeloid diseases and may indicate a poor prognosis.
