Recurring interstitial loss of all or part of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q), is a hallmark of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Although the genes affected by these changes have not been identified, two critically deleted regions (CDRs) are well established. We have identified 76 zebrafish cDNAs orthologous to genes located in these 5q CDRs. Radiation hybrid mapping revealed that 33 of the 76 zebrafish orthologs are clustered in a genomic region on linkage group 14 (LG14). Fifteen others are located on LG21, and two on LG10. Although there are large blocks of conserved syntenies, the gene order between human and zebrafish is extensively inverted and transposed. Thus, intrachromosomal rearrangements and inversions appear to have occurred more frequently than translocations during evolution from a common chordate ancestor. Interestingly, of the 33 orthologs located on LG14, three have duplicates on LG21, suggesting that the duplication event occurred early in the evolution of teleosts. Murine orthologs of human 5q CDR genes are distributed among three chromosomes, 18, 11, and 13. The order of genes within the three syntenic mouse chromosomes appears to be more colinear with the human order, suggesting that translocations occurred more frequently than inversions during mammalian evolution. Our comparative map should enhance understanding of the evolution of the del(5q) chromosomal region. Mutant fish harboring deletions affecting the 5q CDR syntenic region may provide useful animal models for investigating the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.
