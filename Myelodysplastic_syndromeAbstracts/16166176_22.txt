 BACKGROUND: The hematological and quality of life (QoL) changes associated with darbepoetin alfa (DA) therapy were assessed in anemic patients with previously untreated low- and intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients received DA administered subcutaneously once a week for 24 weeks. Treatment was initiated at 150 microg fixed dose and was doubled if after the first 12 weeks there was no or suboptimal erythroid response. RESULTS: The final response rate was 24/53 (45%), with 21 major and three minor responses. Most of the responses (21/24; 87.5%) were obtained at the dose of 150 microg. With a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 17 patients maintain their response. Treatment was well tolerated with no relevant side-effects. MDS progression was observed in one case. Increases in hemoglobin levels were positively correlated with improved QoL scores using both the linear analog scale assessment (energy level, r = 0.429, P = 0.036; daily activities, r = 0.653, P < 0.001; overall well-being, r = 0.457, P = 0.024) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia questionnaire (r = 0.247, P = 0.025). In multivariate analysis, only low levels (<200 IU/l) of endogenous erythropoietin predicted response to DA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: DA is an active, safe and well tolerated treatment for anemia in a substantial proportion of patients with low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS, and has a positive impact on the patients' QoL.
