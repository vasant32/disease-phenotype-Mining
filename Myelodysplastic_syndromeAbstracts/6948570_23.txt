Based on the morphological appearances of the bone marrow and peripheral blood, 43 patients with dysmyelopoietic syndromes were categorized into four types: refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia and refractory anaemia with cellular marrow, without excess of blasts and/or ring sideroblasts. Ferrokinetics allowed three distinct groups of patients to be defined. All cases of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia were classified in the same group. They were characterized by relative marrow failure and had a high likelihood of developing acute leukaemia. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals with primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia had high erythropoietic activity which was largely ineffective. They had a benign clinical course without evidence of leukaemic transformation. In the middle group, in terms of erythropoietic activity, lay patients with refractory anaemia with cellular marrow and a few individuals with primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia. Their clinical course and risk of developing acute leukaemia were intermediate between the other two groups. These findings indicate that separate entities may exist within the spectrum of dysmyelopoietic syndromes. In clinical practice, they may be recognized by morphological studies and other simple laboratory means.
