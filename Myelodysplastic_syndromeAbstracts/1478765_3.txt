Neutrophilic dermatoses (ND), with or without accompanying myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), were examined in terms of nuclear abnormality like pelgeroid anomaly of infiltrating cells into skin lesions. Six ND accompanying MDS showed 1.0 to 13.5% of such anomalous cells among infiltrating cells. In contrast, ND without accompanying myeloproliferative disorders rarely had such anomalous cells. Our findings suggest that pelgeroid-like anomalous cells infiltrating into ND are probably a good marker of underlying MDS.
