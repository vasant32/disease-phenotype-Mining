Data on 65 sibling bone marrow transplantations (BMT) for various hematological disorders are reported. 51 patients had leukemia, 8 severe aplastic anemia, 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, one suffered from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one from myeloid metaplasia. All but two patients have engrafted. Overall, 43 (66%) of 65 patients were alive 0,03-7,2 years (median not reached) as of June 23, 1997. Median time of observation was 13 months. Outcome of standard risk patients was significantly better than that of high risk patients (p=0,006). Our data confirm, that sibling BMT is an effective treatment modality with acceptable toxicity for younger patients with an early stage of serious hematological disorders.
