We studied samples containing deletions of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q) from patients with hematologic malignancies by using cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Cytogenetic analysis of 28 patients and of a cell line showed that all deletions included band 11q23. FISH analysis demonstrated that the proximal part of 11q23, including NCAM, was deleted in 13 of 15 patients and the cell line. Recurring chromosomal losses in human tumors have been regarded as evidence that the affected regions contain tumor-suppressor genes. These results suggest that the putative tumor-suppressor gene is proximal to the MLL gene which is also located in 11q23.
