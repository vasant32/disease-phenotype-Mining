We have identified three unbalanced translocations involving chromosomes 5 and 17, der(5)t(5;17), der(17)t(5;17), and dic(5;17), in the malignant cells from 17 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Six patients had a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo; ten patients had therapy-related MDS and/or AML (t-MDS/t-AML), and one patient had chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast phase. Two of the six patients with MDS or AML de novo had extensive exposure to industrial solvents, and one patient had Seckel syndrome. The primary diagnoses for the ten patients with t-MDS/t-AML were breast carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease in two patients each, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma in one patient each. Four patients had received both prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, four others received prior chemotherapy only, and the remaining two patients only prior radiotherapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 5 and 17 revealed that a dicentric rearrangement was the most common (13/16 patients examined). The genetic consequences of these chromosomal rearrangements are partial monosomy for 5q and 17p. Two of six patients examined had point mutations in TP53, suggesting that loss of function of TP53 in addition to loss of a tumor suppressor gene on 5q may be involved in the pathogenesis of the malignant disease in some of these patients.
