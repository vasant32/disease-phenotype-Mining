Myelodysplasia is characterized by a hypoproliferative anaemia with ineffective intramedullary erythropoiesis. We have used the novel technology of the Bayer H3 analyser to characterize reticulocytes (RNA containing red cells) from 32 MDS patients and 10 elderly normal subjects. In comparison with reticulocytes from normal subjects, those from MDS patients were larger with a lower haemoglobin concentration. Reticulocytes from sideroblastic patients had a lower haemoglobin content and concentration than for refractory anaemia patients but no other differences between FAB subtypes were found. H3 reticulocyte RNA content parameters correlated poorly with those derived by the Sysmex R-1000, particularly in the MDS group. On reticulocyte maturation to red cells MDS patients concentrated haemoglobin more than normal subjects and this was most evident in the sideroblastic group. Platelet depletion of whole blood suggested that large platelets in the sideroblastic group may have partly contributed to this observation. Prospective evaluation of changes towards normal reticulocyte cytometric parameters may assist in assessment of early erythroid response to therapy in MDS patients.
