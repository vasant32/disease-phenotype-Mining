As allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a procedure with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in older patients, many institutions place a limit of 50 to 55 years for allogeneic BMT. Consequently, older patients may not be offered potentially curative treatment for otherwise poor prognosis diseases such as AML or myelodysplastic syndrome. We compared the outcome of 59 patients aged over 50, 124 aged 40-50, and 253 aged 18-39 years who underwent allogeneic BMT in our institution between August 1987 and April 1996. Our results show little influence of age on outcome when comparing patients over 50 years with patients 40-50 years. Apart from an initial higher transplant mortality rate, overall survival was not significantly different between the three age groups. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 57% and 48%, 57% and 48%, and 62% and 58% for the >50 years, 40-50 years, and <40 years patients, respectively. The incidence of GVHD was also comparable. We conclude that allogeneic BMT can be performed in selected patients over the age of 50 years with acceptable morbidity and mortality and that older patients should not be denied this treatment based on age alone.
