In children, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent less then 10% of all hematological malignancies; consequently, molecular genetic studies dealing with this group of patients are scarce. We have analyzed 35 archival bone marrow samples of children with MDS for the presence of mutations in the first and second exons of the NRAS and KRAS2 genes. Mutations were detected with single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis in three patients. One patient harbored a mutation in the second exon of NRAS and two patients in the second exon of KRAS2. Sequencing was performed in two samples and novel mutations were found in both. One patient had a missense mutation in codon 45 of NRAS; the other had a silent mutation in codon 53 and a missense mutation in codon 55 of KRAS2.
