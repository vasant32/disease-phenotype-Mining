Thrombocytopenia is a frequent feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that could be improved by the use of recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (rHuMGDF). Using short-term liquid cultures and progenitor assays, we have found that rHuMGDF stimulated DNA synthesis and potentiated leukemic cluster growth of bone marrow mononuclear cells in 10/38 MDS cases (26%). Cytogenetically malignant colonies were detectable in rHuMGDF-stimulated cultures (n=3) by fluorescence in situ hybridization. rHuMGDF was able to stimulate CFU-MK formation in 45% of the samples tested. Finally, rHuMGDF-induced blast cell proliferation correlated with elevated expression of c-MPL, previously identified as a bad prognosis factor in MDS.
