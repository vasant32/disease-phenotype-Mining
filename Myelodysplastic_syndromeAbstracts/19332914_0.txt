Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of pluripotential stem cells of the bone marrow. The purpose of the study was to obtain epidemiological data of MDS. Thirty cases of MDS presented from April 1998 to May 2006 are included in this study. Complete blood counts were performed in an automated cell counter. Bone marrow aspiration, trephine biopsy and chromosomal study were carried out. The dry film was stained using a Romanwasky stain and Perl's stain. Fifteen cases were male and 15 cases were female. The mean age at presentation was 55 years (range 8-73 years). A majority of the patients presented with weakness (63.33%). Autoimmune manifestations in the form of joint pain were present in 13.33%. Patients were symptomatic for a prolonged period before diagnosis could be reached (average 358.8 days). A majority of the patients had MDS-refractory anemia (MDS-RA) or MDS-RA with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB-2) at presentation. Three patients had chromosomal abnormalities (27.27%). Eight patients (26.7%) were relatively young at presentation, less than 50 years of age. Three (10%) were children. A majority of the patients opted for symptomatic treatment only.
