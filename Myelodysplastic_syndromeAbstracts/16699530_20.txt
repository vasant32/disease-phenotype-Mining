The current study evaluates the role of quantitative measurement of peripheral lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4+ helper T-cell recovery, in predicting transplant outcomes including overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A total of 69 allogeneic recipients were included with following diagnoses: acute myeloid leukemia 42, acute lymphoblastic leukemia 5, chronic myeloid leukemia 15, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 5 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome 2. The peripheral lymphocyte subset counts (CD3+ T cells, CD3+4+ helper T cells, CD3+8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells) were measured at 3, 6 and 12 months. The CD4+ helper T-cell reconstitution at 3 months was strongly correlated with OS (P<0.0001), NRM (P=0.0007), and opportunistic infections (P=0.0108) at the cutoff value of 200 x 10(6)/l CD4(+) helper T cells. Rapid CD4+ helper T-cell recovery was also associated with a higher CD4+ helper T-cell transplant dose (P=0.006) and donor type (P<0.001). An early CD4+ helper T-cell recovery at 3 months correlated with a subsequent faster helper T-cell recovery until 12 months, yet not with B-cell recovery. In a multivariate analysis, rapid recovery of CD4+ helper T cells at 3 months was a favorable prognostic factor together with higher CD34+ cell transplant dose in terms of OS (P=0.001) and NRM (P=0.005).
