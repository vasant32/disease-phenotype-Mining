A novel human gene, named as human CAP10-like protein 46 kDa (hCLP46), was isolated and identified from human acute myeloid leukemia transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML) CD34(+) cells. hCLP46 (3q13.33) contains 11 exons encoding a putative protein of 392 amino acids, with a highly conserved CAP10 domain, a hydrophobic signal peptide at its N-terminus, and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal motif KTEL at the C-terminus. The homologs of hCLP46 exist in different organisms from plants to animal kingdoms. Subcellular localization analysis showed that hCLP46 is an ER-resident protein. hCLP46 expressed in most human adult tissues at different intensities, with lengths of 3.5 kb and 1.9 kb. Transcript of hCLP46 was not detectable in colon, thymus, and small intestine, but was abundant in liver, indicating that hCLP46 may be involved in important physiological functions in the liver. hCLP46 over-expressed U937 cells had higher growth rate than the cells without exogenic hCLP46 protein expression, suggesting that hCLP46 protein possess the ability of promoting cell proliferation.
