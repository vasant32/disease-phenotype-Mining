Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene exon 12 mutations are frequently present in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal karyotype. The NPM1 gene is located on chromosome 5q35, which is often affected in myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This suggests that the NPM1 gene is a one of the target genes affected by chromosome 5 abnormalities and play a role in the development of MDS. It has not been clarified whether MPM1 mutations are present in patients with MDS and AML with chromosome 5 abnormalities. Therefore, we carried out a mutational analysis on the NPM1 gene exon 12. NPM1 mutations were not detected in the 28 patients with MDS and AML with chromosome 5 abnormalities.
