We report herein a case of extramedullary myeloid tumor arising bilaterally in the testes of a 66-year-old man, who had previously been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Light microscopy of the testicular neoplasm demonstrated a tumor composed of large, slightly polygonal cells with pale blue to weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD45, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, CD43, and MB2. Many of the cells also expressed chloroacetate esterase. Peripheral blood and bone marrow findings were consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB-CMML), particularly in the most recent material, which showed clear cellular dysplasia and an increase in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow (15% to 20% of all nucleated cells). This case of extramedullary myeloid tumor is unusual in view of the patient's age and the testicular location. It emphasizes the importance of including extramedullary myeloid tumor in the differential diagnosis of histologically undifferentiated large-cell tumors, as well as a need to use a broad panel of immunohistochemical stains in such cases.
