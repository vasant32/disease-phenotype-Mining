A dog with myelodysplastic syndrome had microcytic hypochromic anemia, with siderocytes, poikilocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils and giant platelets in peripheral blood. In bone marrow, the erythroid series showed immaturity, asynchronous maturation and sideroblasts. Dysgranulopoiesis and dysthrombopoiesis also were present, and hemosiderin was increased. Serum iron concentration was high, and both iron deficiency and lead toxicity were excluded as the cause of dyscrasia. This case represents a unique variant of myelodysplastic syndrome, best described as sideroblastic myelodysplasia. We propose the terms dyserythropoiesis, sideroblastic dyserythropoiesis, dyserythropoiesis with excess blasts, myelodysplasia and sideroblastic myelodysplasia to describe and categorize myelodysplastic syndromes in dogs.
