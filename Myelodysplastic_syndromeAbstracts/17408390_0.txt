Cutaneous manifestations of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) may predict disease progression and a poorer prognosis. We describe a patient in whom a deep neutrophilic dermatosis preceded evolution of disease from refractory anaemia to RAEB (refractory anaemia with excess blasts) and resolved completely on treating the disease with 5-azacytidine. The dermatological response was accompanied by complete bone marrow remission and trilineage haematological improvement. We suggest that 5-azacytidine should be considered in the treatment of immune mediated cutaneous manifestations of MDS.
