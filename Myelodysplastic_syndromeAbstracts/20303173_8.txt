Gene expression profiles of CD34+ cells were compared between 51 MDS patients and 7 controls. The most up-regulated genes in patients included HBG2, HBG1, CYBRD1, HSPA1B, ANGPT, and MYC, while 13 genes related to B-lymphopoiesis showed down-regulation. We observed in advanced MDS patients decreased expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair and increased expression of proto-oncogenes, angiogenic and anti-apoptic genes. The results suggest that increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis together with a loss of cell cycle control, damaged DNA repair and altered immune response may play an important role in malignant clone expansion in MDS.
