We report on two patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome in whom the blood cell counts markedly improved during treatment with haem arginate. One patient received haem arginate only, the other haem arginate in combination with low dose androgen. The drug was given as weekly infusions of 2-3 mg/kg body weight for 8-12 weeks. In one patient the percentage of ringed and other abnormal sideroblasts in the bone marrow was clearly reduced as a result of the treatment. In both patients the effect on blood cell counts lasted for several months after the cessation of the haem arginate treatment. Eleven other patients showed no clear response. No adverse effects of the infusions were observed. Further studies on the possible therapeutic role of haem arginate are indicated.
