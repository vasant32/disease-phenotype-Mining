Current strategies for detecting chromosome abnormalities in MDS/AML include FISH or traditional cytogenetics. MLPA detects abnormalities in multiple loci simultaneously, with higher resolution and throughput. Peripheral blood from 50 healthy subjects was used to establish probe-specific reference ranges, increasing MLPA sensitivity and specificity. MLPA was then performed on 110 FISH-tested blood or bone marrow samples from suspected leukemia patients. Our novel MLPA analysis system combined maximum stringency with sensitive detection of low-frequency abnormalities. Accuracy/specificity of MLPA were excellent compared to FISH. Our MLPA analysis/interpretation method provides a clinically robust, high-throughput, high-resolution option for detection of abnormalities associated with MDS/AML.
