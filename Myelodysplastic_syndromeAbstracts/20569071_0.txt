 OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression level of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR) in malignant clone cells of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHOD: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry (alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase) were used together to detect the expression of IGF-IR in the bone marrow cells of 26 MDS patients with known abnormal karyotypes. RESULT: The average IGF-IR expression level on the surface of clone cells from the 26 MDS cases was markedly elevated compared with the corresponding level in normal cells (78.2 ± 13.7% vs. 14.1 ± 14.0%, p < .0001). The percentages of malignant clone cells in all 26 MDS cases were significantly correlated with the respective percentages of IGF-IR-positive nucleated cells (r = 0.909; p < .0001). No significant difference in the IGF-IR expression level on the clone cells were observed either between high- and low-risk MDS patients or among MDS patients with different abnormal karyotypes. CONCLUSION: IGF-IR might be taken as a marker of clone cells in MDS.
