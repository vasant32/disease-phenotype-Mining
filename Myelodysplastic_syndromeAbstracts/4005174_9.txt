Three children with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are described following the diagnostic criteria proposed by the FAB-cooperative group. Two of the children were of Turkish origin. Two cases fit the criteria for 'refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation'. The other one is most consistent with 'chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia'. The patients received 'ANLL type' induction. One died during induction, two were grafted, of whom one survives.
