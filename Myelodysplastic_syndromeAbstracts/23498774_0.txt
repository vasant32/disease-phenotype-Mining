Hepatic regenerative macronodules observed in hepatic cirrhosis are sensitive to ischemia. Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analog used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, with pleiotropic activities including induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and broad immunomodulatory effects. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in 2007 for the use in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We report a unique observation, which strongly suggests the role of Lenalidomide in hepatic regenerative macronodules infarction.
