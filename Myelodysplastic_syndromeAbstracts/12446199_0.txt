We describe a low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patient who did not respond to erythropoietin alone, but who did show a major erythroid response to combination therapy consisting of erythropoietin and moxifloxacin. This observation was exclusively empirical. The immunomodulatory effects of moxifloxacin may explain the synergy with erythropoietin.
