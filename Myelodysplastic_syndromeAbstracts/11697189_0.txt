Using a model of experimental leukemia in mice, we have demonstrated that tumor development depends upon interactions between preleukemic cells and their microenvironment whose functions are altered. Cytokine injections inhibit tumor development by inducing a functional restoration of this environment. Human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are marrow pathologies considered as preleukemic stages. As in murine leukemias, it is possible that marrow environment could play a key role in their evolution. We currently establish a model of human hematopoiesis in NOD/SCID mice grafted with human bone fragments. We hope that this model would allow to analyse the role of the marrow stromal cells in MDS and to establish treatments restoring their functions.
