Bone marrow sections from 44 cats with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were graded for reticulin content using light microscopic methods. Twenty-seven (61%) of the cats had slight to marked reticulin myelofibrosis. The association of myelofibrosis with possible pathogenetic factors, including megakaryocyte count, intramedullary lymphoid follicles, hemosiderin content, and FeLV antigenemia, was examined. No evidence was found that indicated a causal relationship between myelofibrosis and any of these factors.
