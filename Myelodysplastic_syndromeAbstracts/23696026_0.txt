Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic neoplasms, and the pathophysiology of these disorders is still unclear. Previous studies investigating the association between glutathione S-transferase Tl (GSTT1) null genotype and risk of MDS reported controversial results. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the effect of GSTT1 null genotype on risk of MDS. The strength of the association was measured by odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Fifteen studies were finally included, involving a total of 1,796 cases and 2,502 controls. Subgroup analysis was performed by race. Meta-analysis of all 15 studies showed that the GSTT1 null genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of MDS (OR = 1.47, 95 % CI 1.16-1.88, P OR = 0.002; I (2) = 54.4 %). Besides, an obvious association was also observed after adjusting the heterogeneity (OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.13-1.54, P OR = 0.001; I (2) = 9.0 %). Subgroup analysis by race suggested that this association existed in both Caucasians (OR = 1.40, 95 % CI 1.04-1.89, P OR = 0.027) and Asians (OR = 1.68, 95 % CI 1.00-2.81, P OR = 0.049). This meta-analysis suggests the GSTT1 null genotype is significantly associated with an increased risk of MDS in both Caucasians and Asians.
