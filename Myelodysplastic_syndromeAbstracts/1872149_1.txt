A case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who suffered alternating proptosis was reported. A 57-year-old Japanese man with MDS developed acute painful left proptosis with eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, visual disturbance, and restriction of eye movements. This lasted for 3 weeks. Computerized tomography (CT) showed swelling of the lateral and medial rectus muscles and the optic nerve, as well as a retrobulbar mass. Later, a similar painful right proptosis with severe conjunctival chemosis developed. CT showed only bilateral mild optic nerve swelling. The visual acuity of the right eye decreased to null even after remission of the proptosis. The patient died due to myocardial infarction and underwent autopsy. The right optic nerve stroma was found to be increased over that of the left. Cellular infiltration was noted in the left optic nerve and the retrobulbar connective tissue. This self-limiting and relapsing proptosis was apparently related to MDS. This is only the second MDS case with such severe ophthalmological symptoms reported in the literature.
