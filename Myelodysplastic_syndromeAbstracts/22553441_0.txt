Yersinia enterocolitica septicemia is described in a patient with transfusional iron overload and a myelodysplastic syndrome. The organism was biotype 1 serotype 0:5,27 and carried a virulence-encoding plasmid. It was calcium-dependent, autoagglutinating and virulent to orally challenged mice, but not resistant to the bacteriocidal activity of serum. The patient had depressed neutrophil chemotaxis and bactericidal activity. In this case, both host and microbial factors were present to select out this particular bacteremic disease. Patients with iron overload states should be recognized as compromised hosts and potentially susceptible to spontaneous sepsis due to Y enterocolitica.
