Monosomy 7 myelodysplasia is a rare hematological entity and is associated with morphological abnormalities in bone marrow and peripheral smear, and poor prognosis in children. We describe 2 children with infantile monosomy 7 myelodysplasia which evolved to leukemia. One of them died after 1 month, and the other is still on therapy for acute myelocytic leukemia (M4) which has evolved from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We concluded that chromosomal analysis must be done routinely in patients with myelodysplasia, in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
