To investigate the expression of the cholinesterase-related cell division controller (CHED) gene in the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), CHED gene expression was assayed by RT-PCR and its relative expression rate (RER) was determined by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 patients with MDS, 12 normal individuals served as controls. Results showed that RER of CHED in the patients (2.69 +/- 0.76) was significantly higher than that in controls (1.12 +/- 0.51, P < 0.01), the RER out of 85.7% of the patients was higher than the mean value of the controls, in which three patients developed into acute leukemia; the RER out of 61.9% of the patients was higher than the upper limit of the mean value of the controls; three patients whose RER was lower than the mean value of the controls did not developed into leukemia. These findings suggested that the expression of CHED gene in patients with MDS was significantly higher than in controls.
