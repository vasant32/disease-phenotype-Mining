The 6;9 chromosomal translocation [t(6;9)] is usually associated with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and carries a poor prognosis. We present a case of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) accompanied by t(6;9). Review of the literature revealed an additional ten patients in which myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was associated with the chromosomal translocation 6;9. The patients tend to be younger then the average MDS patient and, unlike leukemia, in which this translocation is associated with a poor prognosis, these patients tend to have the same overall RAEB and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) prognosis. It is therefore possible that this chromosomal aberration should not be considered as an unfavorable prognostic factor in MDS.
