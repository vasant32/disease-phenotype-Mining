We describe the first case of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(3;3) (q21;q26) occurring in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient sequentially treated with chemotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The t(3;3) is a nonrandom abnormality found in a small percentage of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary AML or chronic myeloid leukemia and is strongly associated with abnormal thrombopoiesis and a particularly poor prognosis. So far, it has never been observed in HIV-positive patients. Sporadic cases of AML have been reported in HIV patients and the feasibility of chemotherapy in association with HAART and disease outcome are still not clearly defined. Despite the poor response to chemotherapy in our case, which might also be related to the unfavorable karyotype, the secondary nature of the disease and the HIV positivity, the patient had a relatively long period of survival that could be due to the use of HAART. The association of chemotherapy with HAART appeared to be feasible and tolerable and could be suggested as a choice treatment in this peculiar subset of HIV/AML patients.
