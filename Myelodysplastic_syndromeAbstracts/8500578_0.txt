The SV40 large T gene under the control of immunoglobulin enhancer induced hyperproliferation of multilineage hematopoiesis in transgenic mice. Huge splenomegaly was the major gross abnormality; mice were rather anemic, and neither leukoerythroblastosis nor invasion into tissues such as liver, kidneys or lymph nodes was common. In the latter phases of the disease, the proliferating cell type tended to shift to a variety of single-lineage hematopoiesis, but the majority of mice still showed the presence of multilineage hematopoiesis; such cells were somewhat dysplastic but low in neoplastic potential. A long-term observation by transplantation of the hematopoietic cells into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice resulted in a variety of neoplastic growths in the recipients; not only was myelodysplastic hypercellularity seen, but also single-lineage hematopoietic malignancies such as B cell lymphomas/leukemias, histiocytic malignancies and even myeloid leukemias. The disease bore the proliferative feature solely in the spleen and bone marrow, and the transition from multilineage myelodysplasia into single-lineage hematopoiesis at some frequency is reminiscent of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in humans. The results that the SV40 large T antigen was expressed in every proliferating cell, and that there was no apparent increase in any colony-stimulating cytokine(s), together with the results of the transplantation assays, suggested that the hyperproliferation of the hematopoietic cells was a direct consequence of the expression of SV40 large T antigen in these cells themselves.
