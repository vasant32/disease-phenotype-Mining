Three consecutive cases of pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed over a three-year period in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, were described. Depending on the classification system used, they comprised two cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) of which one can be reclassified as juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML) and one cases of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or an alternative diagnosis of atypical CML. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in all of them on examination of bone marrow cells. Of the two CMMoL, one had monosomy 21, whereas the other had hypodiploidy. The patient with RAEB had a complex karyotype of 46,X,del(X)(q24),t(1;7) (p22;q32),add(15)(q26)(8). The balanced translocation (1;7) seen in this patient was exceedingly rare and, to the best of our knowledge, was reported only twice in the literature. The karyotypic abnormalities that we saw in our patients were not well recognized in pediatric MDS. This report emphasizes the importance of cytogenetic study in children suspected of suffering from MDS, which remains a rare disorder of childhood, and a need to rationalize current classification schemes.
