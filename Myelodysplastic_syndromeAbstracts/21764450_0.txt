Diagnosis of MDS has changed during the last years because of the 2008 WHO classification. Complete blood cell count (CBC) is a very important tool both for diagnosis of MDS. The aim of this study was to evaluate if it is possible to use the abnormal signals produced by dysplastic cells to produce a flag "dysplasia" able to identify the patients needing further hematological investigations. The proposed flag has been tested in a large group of patients to evaluate the sensibility and specificity. We create 5 patterns of MDS. Our study demonstrated that the flag "dysplasia" is specific and sensible for MDS.
