 BACKGROUND: Many viral and neoplastic diseases are resistant to interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) therapy or develop resistance during the course of IFN treatment. In patients with viral diseases, the authors identified four IFN inhibitors, of which the most important, most likely is a free IFN receptor of type 1 appearing in the circulation that captures and neutralizes IFN-alpha/beta. METHODS: Ninety-one cancer patients and 25 healthy individuals were studied. Free circulating IFN receptor-alpha/beta type 1 was studied. The patients were ages 35-75 years. The diagnoses were 24 cases of colon carcinoma, 7 cases of prostate carcinoma, 16 cases of breast carcinoma, 8 cases of ovarian carcinoma, 9 cases of uterine carcinoma, 5 cases of lung carcinoma, 3 cases of astrocytoma, 4 cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, 1 case of osteosarcoma, 3 cases of multiple myeloma, 4 cases of Hodgkin disease, 2 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 3 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 disseminated tumors of unknown origin. RESULTS: All patients were found to have increased free IFN receptor-alpha/beta type 1 in the circulation, with the highest levels reported in patients with adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: High IFN inhibitory activity in patients with cancer may be a significant factor in their increased susceptibility to progressive disease, infectious complications, and resistance to IFN therapy. Ongoing studies are being performed with the objective of overcoming this inhibitory activity.
