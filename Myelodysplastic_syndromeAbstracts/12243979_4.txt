Apart from one report of phimosis, involvement of the penis has not been reported as a complication of chronic GVHD. We report a patient with recurrent chronic GVHD who developed skin discoloration of the penile shaft, together with erectile dysfunction consistent with Peyronie's disease. Histological features were consistent with sclerodermatous change. These features suggest that the penis may be a target organ in chronic GVHD.
