Soluble receptors have been identified for most members of the TNF-receptor/NGF receptor superfamily. CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) is of particular importance, since its triggering may induce apoptosis in sensitive cells. Recently, a soluble form of the CD95 molecule was described which interacts with the CD95-CD95 ligand death pathway. Increased concentrations of soluble CD95 (sCD95) were previously detected in some patients with T and B cell leukemias and lymphomas. In the present study we investigated sCD95 in the serum of patients with myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 72 patients was studied (29 AML, 17 MDS, 20 CML and six other myeloproliferative disorders). In AML with active disease, the levels of sCD95 tended to be elevated, but did not correlate with defined clinical or laboratory parameters. In the other disorders, the levels of sCD95 were not generally increased, although some patients had elevated levels. These data strongly suggest that sCD95 in AML patients is not derived from leukemic cells, but is possibly secreted or shed from reactive or stromal cells. This hypothesis is also supported by a group of eight patients with septicemia but not leukemia who had elevated sCD95 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, all three patients with elevated sCD95 who had undergone chemotherapy for AML had major infections. Taken together, this study shows that measuring soluble Fas-receptor in myeloid leukemia is not diagnostically useful, but increased sCD95 may be associated with clinical complications like septicemias.
