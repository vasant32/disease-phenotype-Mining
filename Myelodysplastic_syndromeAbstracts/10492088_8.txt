Some patients with haematological neoplasms have features which overlap between a myelodysplastic syndrome and a myeloproliferative disorder. Two such patients are reported, both having sideroblastic erythropoiesis and thrombocytosis and one sequentially developing features of atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis and acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia. The prevalence of thrombocytosis among cases of refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts may be as high as 15-20% and has implications for choice of therapy.
