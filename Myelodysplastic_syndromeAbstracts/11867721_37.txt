The translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) is one of the most frequent chromosome translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML1/RUNX1 at 21q22 is involved in t(8;21), t(3;21), and t(16;21) in de novo and therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome as well as in t(12;21) in childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO (at 8q22) cluster in a few introns, the mechanisms of DNA recombination resulting in t(8;21) are unknown. The correlation of specific chromatin structural elements, i.e., topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and scaffold-associated regions, which have been implicated in chromosome recombination with genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO in t(8;21) is unknown. The breakpoints in AML1 and ETO were clustered in the Kasumi 1 cell line and in 31 leukemia patients with t(8;21); all except one had de novo AML. Sequencing of the breakpoint junctions revealed no common DNA motif; however, deletions, duplications, microhomologies, and nontemplate DNA were found. Ten in vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites were mapped in AML1, including three in intron 5 and seven in intron 7a, and two were in intron 1b of ETO. All strong topo II sites colocalized with DNase I hypersensitive sites and thus represent open chromatin regions. These sites correlated with genomic DNA breakpoints in both AML1 and ETO, thus implicating them in the de novo 8;21 translocation.
