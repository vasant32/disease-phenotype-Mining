Alterations of the ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2) gene have been recently identified in patients with myeloid malignancies using molecular, comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism array techniques. We have performed TET2 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in a cohort of patients with myeloid disorders including myeloid malignancies and chronic idiopathic neutropenia, aiming to determine the usefulness of the technique in the identification of TET2 gene alterations. A TET2 deletion was found in one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia suggesting that fluorescence in situ hybridization may have a role in identification of TET2 deletions, at least in this group of patients.
