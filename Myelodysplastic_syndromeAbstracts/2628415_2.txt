We reviewed 213 consecutive adult pancytopenic patients to determine the frequency of underlying pathology, to analyze our diagnostic procedure, and to determine the value of peripheral blood data for diagnosis. Pancytopenia was defined as the association of hemoglobin level below 12 g/dl in males and 11.5 g/dl in females, leukopenia below 4 x 10(9)/L, and thrombocytopenia below 150 x 10(9)/L. The bone marrow aspirates were normo- or hypercellular in 140 cases (66%). Bone marrow biopsies, performed in 93 cases, documented the presence of myelofibrosis in 67 cases. Aplastic anemia was diagnosed in 10% of the cases. Malignant myeloid disorders (acute myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid disorders with myelofibrosis) represented 42% of the cases and various malignant lymphoid disorders 18%. Vitamin deficiencies accounted for 7.5% and nonhematological pathology 10% of the cases. The bone marrow aspirate was sufficient for the diagnosis in 55% of the cases, and the trephine biopsy was necessary in 30%. In the remaining cases, other complementary tests were necessary to achieve final diagnosis. A discriminant analysis, focused on the hemogram data, showed that parameters obtained by analysis of blood smears were helpful for the diagnosis, especially the presence or absence of blast cells and/or of abnormal lymphoid cells.
