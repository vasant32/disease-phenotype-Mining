The activity of the DNA excision repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in bone marrow aspiration samples obtained from patients with pernicious anemia (PA) or other types of megaloblastic anemia (one case of tapeworm anemia and three cases of myelodysplastic syndromes). In addition, the expression of uracil-DNA glycosylase was investigated in biopsies from the antrum and body of the stomach obtained from nine PA patients, from five patients having atrophic gastritis (AG) not associated with PA, and from six control patients having transient upper abdominal complaints without AG. Our results revealed that there was a considerable interindividual variation in gastric uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. No clear correlation between the enzyme level and the level of gastric atrophy was noted, although AG is generally regarded as a risk factor of gastric cancer. Furthermore, uracil-DNA glycosylase activities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in bone marrow cells in PA and in myelodysplastic syndromes were similar to the activities observed previously in non-hematological patients and healthy persons. Transient uracil incorporation into DNA may have a role in the cellular abnormalities associated with megaloblastic hematopoiesis. The present findings demonstrated that the enzymatic activity required for rapid removal of uracil from DNA is also expressed in the megaloblastic state.
