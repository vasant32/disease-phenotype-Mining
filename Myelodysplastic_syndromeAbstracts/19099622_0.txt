This study was aimed to investigate the chromosome 5 abnormalities in complex chromosome aberrations (CCAs) in myeloid malignancies, chromosome aberrations of 68 cases of myeloid malignancies with CCAs were analysed. The 68 cases included 22 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 32 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 14 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The results showed that the complex chromosome abnormalities were found in all chromosomes of 68 cases, but the incidence of chromosome 5 abnormality was higher (38.2%, 26/68), including 45.5% (10/22) in AML, 15.6% (5/32) in CML and 78.6% (11/14) in MDS. The most common aberrations in chromosome 5 were unbalanced translocations. The aberrations of chromosome 5 and chromosome 17 were confirmed simultaneously in 11 cases, the aberrations of chromosome 5 and chromosome 7 were confirmed simultaneously in 9 cases. It is concluded that the aberration of chromosome 5 is common in myeloid malignancies, and presents unbalanced translocation. Aberrations of chromosome 5 often accompany with aberrations of chromosome 7 or 17.
