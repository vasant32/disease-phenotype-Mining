Current knowledge is inadequate to explain the different patterns of blast cell accumulation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We compared the growth patterns of blast cell progenitors (CFU-L) in 23 patients with advanced MDS and 32 patients with de novo AML. Circulating blast progenitors were identified in 74% of MDS and 81% of AML samples. Primary plating efficiencies (PE1) were similar in both disorders, despite marked differences in peripheral blast cell concentrations. By cytological and cytochemical examination, colonies from MDS patients were indistinguishable from those obtained in AML. Cell cycle status was assessed by loss of colony formation following short-term exposure to cytosine arabinoside. CFU-L suicide rates (median, range) were 40% (12% to 77%) in MDS and 60.5% (27% to 98%) in AML. Actively proliferating blast cell progenitors are thus not confined to AML, but are also present in the majority of MDS patients. An important difference between MDS and AML was found when self-renewal capacity of CFU-L was examined by means of secondary plating efficiencies (PE2). Colonies could be successfully replated in 74% of AML cases. PE2 showed marked heterogeneity (2 to 730 colonies/10(5) mononuclear cells), with some values indicating excessive self-renewal capacity of CFU-L. In contrast, 62% of the MDS specimens failed to produce any secondary colony growth, and PE2 in the remaining cases was low (5 to 99/10(5) MNC). We conclude that a different balance between self-renewal and determination could be responsible for a slower pace of clonal expansion in MDS, even if the proliferative activity of clonogenic cells is similar to that in AML.
