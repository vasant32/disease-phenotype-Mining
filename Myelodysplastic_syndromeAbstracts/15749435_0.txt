Patients with neurological illnesses often require prolonged enteral or parenteral nutrition. The complications of this type of feeding may be unfamiliar to neurosurgeons and neurologists, however, these complications may be an important source of ongoing morbidity. We present a case of severe anemia due to copper deficiency in a patient requiring enteral nutrition after SAH. The anemia resolved with copper supplements. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognise and treat complications of enteral nutrition.
