The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using the technique of premature chromosome condensation to detect the in vivo maturation of abnormal elements in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukemia. Patients were chosen for study if there were a clinical suggestion of in vivo maturation and a leukemic clone exhibiting a distinguishable karyotypic abnormality. Mature peripheral blood granulocytes were enriched by two-step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation and fused with mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells to induce the formation of prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC). These PCC were then analyzed for chromosome number per cell (in the case of patients with a numerical abnormality) or by G-banding (in the case of specific translocations). Of 13 patients chosen for study, 12 showed karyotypic evidence for maturation of the abnormal elements in vivo. Maturation was observed in a number of clinical situations including before treatment in benign CML and myelodysplasia, after low-dose and high-dose chemotherapy in myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and in remission. These results suggest that the technique of premature chromosome condensation can be a powerful tool in better understanding the biology of disease and mode of response to therapy in vivo in patients with leukemia and preleukemic syndromes, especially during treatment with agents thought to induce maturation of the leukemic elements.
