BACKGROUND: After allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation, a patient developed a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction due to passenger lymphocyte syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old woman with secondary acute myeloid leukemia transforming from a myelodysplastic syndrome received an ABO-compatible PBPC graft from her HLA-identical sister. For prophylaxis of GVHD, the patient was treated with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Eighteen days after the transplant, the patient experienced a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction due to an alloantibody (anti-Jk(a)) produced by donor lymphocytes. RESULTS: The patient was typed as group A, Jk(a+) before transplantation; the donor was typed as group A, Jk(a-). On Day 18 after transplantation, the immunohematologic screening revealed a positive DAT (C3d 3+) and an alloanti-Jk(a). Hemolysis in the patient at that time was indicated by a drop in the Hb and an increase in the LDH level (maximum, 592 IU/L on Day 23). CONCLUSION: The course of hemolysis and the time of appearance of an alloantibody in this patient meet the criteria for passenger lymphocyte syndrome. In most cases, this syndrome is triggered by ABO system antibodies. This is the first reported case of passenger lymphocyte syndrome after PBPC transplantation that was due to an alloantibody that did not belong to the ABO system.
