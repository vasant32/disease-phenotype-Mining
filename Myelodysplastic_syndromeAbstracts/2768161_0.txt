Thirty thrombocytopaenic patients of acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndrome were transfused platelets collected from ABO-matched donors using Haemonetics V30 and V50 blood processors. Twenty-seven patients had septicaemia and/or splenomegaly; 2 patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Pre-transfusion platelet count was 11.0 +/- 4.0 X 10(9)/L. The mean corrected count increments (CCI) 1 hour and 18 hours post-transfusion were 13.02 X 10(9)/L and 3.88 X 10(9)/L respectively, in the absence of DIC. Active bleeding stopped when platelet count was above 15.0 X 10(9)/L. There was no difference between the platelet yield from two blood processors.
