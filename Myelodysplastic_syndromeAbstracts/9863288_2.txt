We describe a case of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF, Ofuji's disease) in a 12-year-old male who suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome. Bone marrow study revealed an increase in the eosinophil cell line without peripheral blood eosinophilia in our case. We suggest that the immunologic abberations ascribed to myelodysplastic syndrome and the increase in the eosinophil cell line in the bone marrow might play roles in the development of EPF in our case.
