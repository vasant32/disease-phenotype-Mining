 OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hematopoietic cells and investigate its relationship to apoptosis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. METHOD: Mononuclear cells from 18 MDS patients were used to analyze the expression of EGFR and the apoptotic signals by immunocytochemical technique and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) fluorescein. Flow cytometry (FCM) sorted CD(34)(+) cells from 15 MDS cases and 6 normal donors were also analyzed for the EGFR expression and apoptotic signals. Nine normal marrow samples were taken as controls. EGFR expression and its relationship to apoptosis were analysed. RESULTS: (1) There was a higher EGFR expression rate (38.6 +/- 24.6)% in nucleated cells of MDS marrow than in normal marrow (18.1 +/- 14.0)% (P < 0.05). (2) Apoptosis occurred much more in EGFR negative cells (16.1%) than in EGFR positive cells (1.4%) (P < 0.01). EGFR expression showed negative correlation with apoptosis (r = -0.701; t(r) = 3.60; P < 0.01). (3) In CD(34)(+) cells, EGFR expression rate seemed higher in RAEB/RAEB-t/CMML than that in RA/RAS (20.6 +/- 27.9 vs 8.9 +/- 11.8%) subgroup (P > 0.05), while apoptosis was lower in RAEB/RAEB-t/CMML subgroup than in RA/RAS cases (18.2 +/- 12.5 vs 45.2 +/- 20.5%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is overexpression of EGFR in MDS cases. And it seems that the overexpressed EGFR represent somewhat the malignant proliferation in MDS and suppress apoptosis through a unknown mechanism.
