Three cases with chromosome changes involving bands 7p14 or 7p15 and 11p15 are described: one was a Japanese female with an acute myelomonocytic leukemia, the second was a white female with a 10-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who developed a myelodysplastic syndrome, and the third was a patient with Ph-negative atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia with trisomy 8 and a chromosome change involving bands 7p14 and 11p15. These cases possibly indicate that the t(7;11)(p14 or p15;p15) change may characterize a subset of human nonlymphocytic neoplasia.
