Immunosuppressive therapy related secondary haematologic malignancy is well reported. A 52 years lady with established rheumatoid arthritis developed reactive amyloidosis. This was initially treated with colchicine and cyclophosphamide and later with chlorambucil. Ten months after stopping chlorambucil she developed pancytopenia and vitamin B12 deficient megaloblastic anaemia. The pancytopenia was refractory to vitamin B12 supplements and a repeat bone marrow confirmed myelodysplasia (FABI RAEB-T). Within three weeks of this diagnosis she evolved into acute myeloid leukaemia and expired due to refractory thrombocytopenia and uncontrolled bleeding. This case stresses the need for long term follow up of RA patients treated with alkylating agents.
