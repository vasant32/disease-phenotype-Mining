The long-term outcome of patients with haematological malignancies treated with reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is not known. We report the outcome of 79 patients with poor-risk myeloid and lymphoid malignancies transplanted with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. The diagnoses include AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=43), non Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=30), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=3), ALL (n=2) and CML (n=1). For the entire cohort, the disease-free survival (DFS) and OS were 61.2 and 35.7%, respectively. Twenty patients relapsed, 18 within the first three years, and 14 patients succumbed to progressive disease. Overall, 31 patients died from transplant-related complications within the first three years. Day 100 non-relapse mortality correlated with a higher total nucleated cell dose in the graft (odds ratio: 3.9). For those in CR at 3 years, the DFS and OS were 84.2 and 81.1%, respectively. Furthermore, of 43 patients with active disease at the time of transplantation, 16 remained in CR after 3 years. The majority of the long-term survivors were functioning independently. One patient died from a second malignancy. No post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was seen. In conclusion, durable disease control was achieved after RIC allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with advanced myeloid and lymphoid malignancies.
