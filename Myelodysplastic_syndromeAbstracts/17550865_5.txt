Using a very simple flow cytometry protocol, we found that CD36 and CD117 on granulocytes and CD56 on monocytes were the major bone marrow phenotypic aberrations in patients with myelodysplasia, including CMML. CD56 on monocytes was associated with CMML. Importantly, phenotypic aberrations were lost on blood cells, except for CD56.
