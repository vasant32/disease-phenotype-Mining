A 62 year old male patient was previously admitted to another hospital in February 1989 because of palpitation. Peripheral blood examination revealed pancytopenia. Although the number of nucleated cells in the bone marrow aspirate was in the normal range. It contained 2.2% of blastic cells and dysplastic cells. He was diagnosed to be myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia. He subsequently received repeated blood transfusions and other symptomatic treatments as an outpatient until 1990. When he was admitted to our hospital because of severe pancytopenia. The numbers of WBC, RBC, and platelets were 2,000/microliters, 134 x 10(4)/microliters, 2.9 x 10(4)/microliters respectively. Bone marrow aspiration resulted in dry tap, and biopsy at the iliac bone showed remarkable fibrosis with marked decrease of normal hematopoietic cells. Chromosome analysis revealed multiple aberrations such as 47XY, +8, 13q-, 14p+, 48XY, +8, +9, 13q+. The patient was treated with BHAC-AMP combination chemotherapy. After 3 cycles of the therapy, pancytopenia was improved and chromosomal aberration disappeared. This case was considered to be an acute myelofibrosis developed from myelodysplastic syndrome and worth to reporting with a review of literature, because drastic combination chemotherapy was extremely effective.
