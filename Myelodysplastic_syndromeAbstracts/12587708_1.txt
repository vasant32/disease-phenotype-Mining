Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare extramedullary malignant mass composed of primitive cells of the granulocytic lineage. It can arise from any part of the body and is frequently associated with haematological diseases, commonly acute myeloid leukaemia. Rarely, it has been found in conjunction with myelodysplastic syndrome. We report a case of cutaneous granulocytic sarcoma in a 73-year-old lady. The patient presented with a two-month history of multiple skin nodules which were confirmed by skin biopsy to be granulocytic sarcoma. Bone marrow examination was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome. Localised radiotherapy to the skin lesions were given. She died from septicaemia six months after presentation. The management of this condition presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for both the pathologist and physician. In cases which are poorly differentiated as in this case, histological diagnosis is particularly difficult. Its definitive diagnosis would then require the additional use of a broad panel of immunohistochemical and cytochemical stains.
