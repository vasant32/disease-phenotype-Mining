In hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia (HAA), an immune-mediated mechanism is solely responsible for the development of pancytopenia. We retrospectively analysed the clinical outcome of 61 children with HAA, diagnosed between 1988 and 1996. Of 61 patients, 41 did not receive bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and their survival rate at 7 years was 61.4 +/- 9.3%(+/- SE). Five of these 41 patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) 7-57 months after the diagnosis of HAA. The incidence of MDS/AML in severe HAA patients who did not receive BMT (n = 30, 27.0 +/- 10.8%) appeared to be similar to that of severe idiopathic AA patients (n = 155, 14.7 +/- 3.7%) treated in the same period.
