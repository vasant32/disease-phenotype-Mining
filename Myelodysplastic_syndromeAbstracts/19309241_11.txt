Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are important in the support of hematopoiesis. In this pilot study, we evaluated the safety and efficiency of donor-expanded MSC infusion after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in six patients with poor hematopoietic recovery. MSCs were infused without HSC and without conditioning at a dose of 1 x 10(6)/kg weight. Two patients displayed rapid hematopoietic recovery (days 12 and 21), and four patients showed no response. The two patients who showed hematopoietic recovery were in first complete remission (CR1) compared to the other heavily pretreated patients. There were no toxic side effects linked to MSC infusion. One patient developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation 12 days following the MSC infusion and died from CMV disease. We found that infusion of MSCs without HSC co-infusion can restore medullary function in some patients with poor hematopoietic recovery. Our data suggest that patients with a less damaged stroma could benefit from this approach.
