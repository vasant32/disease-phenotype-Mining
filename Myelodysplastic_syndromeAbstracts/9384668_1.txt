We treated 12 patients with leukemia relapse after allogenic bone marrow transplantation with a combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) ((2.5-5.0) x 10(6) u/m2 subcutaneously three times a week) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) ((1.8-3.6) x 10(6) IU/m2 subcutaneously five times a week) to determine the toxicity and efficacy of combination cytokine therapy in this setting. The median age of the patients was 39 years (range: 16-50). There were nine females and three males. The median time to relapse from BMT was 98 days (range: 0-963). At the time of relapse, six patients had AML, four patients had CML (two in blast crisis and two in chronic phase with clonal evolution), and one patient had lymphoblastic lymphoma. Combination cytokine therapy was started a median of 108 days post BMT (range: 37-2404). Nine patients treated at the higher dose level required a 50% dose reduction because of toxicity or GVHD (three CNS, two GVHD, one high fever, one diarrhoea with hypotension, and one pericarditis). At a lower dose level, 2 of 10 patients had their treatment discontinued because of toxicity or GVHD. Six patients developed clinical findings consistent with acute GVHD while on combination cytokine therapy. Two patients responded to combination cytokine therapy: one with CML and one with AML. Combination cytokine therapy is feasible in the setting of relapse post allogeneic BMT. The combination of IL-2 1.8 x 10(6) IU/m2 five times a week with IFN-2 2.5 x 10(6) U/m2 three times a week seems to be tolerable, and merits further study in this setting.
