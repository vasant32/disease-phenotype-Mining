Aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were successfully treated with an intermittent administration of high-dose 1 alpha-hydroxy-vitamin D3, an active analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This effect was considered to be through the differentiation-inducing and immunomodulatory actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The only adverse effect was hypercalciuria which was controllable by decreasing the dose.
