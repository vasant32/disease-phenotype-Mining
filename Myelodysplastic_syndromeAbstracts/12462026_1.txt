Twelve transfusion-dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with immunosuppressive therapy; 8 with cyclosporin A (CyA), 3 with CyA and antithymocyte globulin (ATG), one with ATG. G-CSF was combined in 10 patients. Eight patients who consisted of 4 treated with CyA, 3 with ATG/CyA, and one with ATG, achieved transfusion-independence. Responses were observed in 8/9 patients with refractory anemia, 0/3 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blast, although the recovery was incomplete in most cases. All of the CyA-responsive patients took drug-dependent courses. The presence of GPI-anchored protein-deficient granulocytes (CD11b+CD55-CD59-) was examined by flow cytometry after treatment in 6 responsive patients, and was demonstrated in 2 of them. HLA-DR15 was found in 5 of 7 responsive patients, suggesting that the presence of this allele may be associated with a good response to immunosuppressive therapy. All responsive patients had refractory anemia classified to IPSS Int-1, and had common conditions as follows: absence of chromosomal abnormality, short interval from diagnosis to therapy, and employment of ATG therapy.
