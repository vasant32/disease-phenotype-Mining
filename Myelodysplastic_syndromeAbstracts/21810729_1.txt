 BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in a median overall survival (OS) of ≤ 1 year. Elderly patients often present with cardiac comorbidity. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is active in elderly (≥ 60 years) patients with relapsed AML with low cardiac toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized phase II study compared a standard combination of ara-C and daunorubicin (DNR; 7+3) versus ara-C plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin (7+GO) as the first course of induction therapy. Primary objectives were comparison of blast clearance on day 16, event-free survival (EFS), and remission duration. OS, complete remission (CR), and tolerability were secondary objectives. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients with de novo AML, treatment-related AML, AML with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or high-risk MDS entered the study. Median age of 115 patients (intent-to-treat population) was 69 years. Protocol outlined a second course 7+3 for patients without blast clearance and two courses of high-dose ara-C consolidation upon CR. Both treatments were equally effective in blast clearance, CR, EFS, remission duration, or OS (median: 7+3, 9 months; 7+GO, 10 months). Induction death rate was higher in the GO group due to veno-occlusive disease. CONCLUSION: The study did not show significant superiority of 7+GO over standard 7+3.
