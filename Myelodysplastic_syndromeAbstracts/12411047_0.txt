 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between isolated trisomy 11 and the clinical, hematological, immunological, prognostic aspects in hematological malignancies. METHODS: Bone marrow cell cytogenetic analysis was performed by direct method and/or 24 h culture method. RHG banding was used for karyotype analysis. Immunophenotype analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Ten patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with HA regimen chemotherapy and followed up. RESULTS: The isolated trisomy 11 was found in 11 of 1 * ! 763 hematological malignancies cases (0.6%). The diagnoses included 10 AML (6 M(2), 2 M(5), 1 M(1), 1 M(4)), and 1 myelodysplastic syndromes. Ten of them have no hepatosplenomegaly. The immunophenotypical analysis of leukemia cells showed positive for CD(13), CD(33) and CD(34) in 5 cases. Follow-up data were available in 10 cases. The complete remission rate was 40% with a median survival of 10 months. CONCLUSION: The isolated trisomy 11 was mainly seen in AML, especially in M(2) subtype. Their prognosis was poor.
