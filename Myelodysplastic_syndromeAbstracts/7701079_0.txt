Chromosome analyses were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood leucocytes of 117 patients with acute and chronic leukemias and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative and hypereosinophilic syndromes, diagnosed in a Costa Rican hospital from May 1990 to July 1992. Cytogenetic diagnosis was achieved in 69.5% of the 131 samples, the karyotype was normal in half of them. The most common chromosomal defect was the Philadelphia translocation, found in 80.5% of the patients with chronic myelocitic leukemia as referral diagnosis and in some other cases. Other primary and secondary chromosomal abnormalities were less frequent. The karyotype analysis proved useful in clinical evaluation and management.
