Screening for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the panel of 18 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, especially from the region 11p15, was carried out on 154 samples from 26 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and eight with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). LOH was detected at the majority (72%) of the loci tested: 47% of informative patients displayed LOH for at least one of the microsatellite locus from the region 11p15 and 23.5% of patients displayed LOH among the other markers tested within the study. A longitudinal follow-up of patients showed a remarkable heterogeneity of LOH appearance and its persistance during the course of the disease suggesting an intratumor clonal heterogeneity, or alternatively, presence of LOH in more than one cell clone. The data revealed two regions of high loss of one allele in 11p15.5, defined by markers D11S1363 and D11S1338, indicating that LOH at the subtelomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 11 is a much common event in hematological malignancies than it was previously reported.
