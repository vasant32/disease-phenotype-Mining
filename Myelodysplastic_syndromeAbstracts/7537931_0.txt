Although it has been shown that the percentage of bone marrow blasts in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) constitute the only independent determinant of survival and progression to acute leukemia, the great variability in survival among patients with MDS of similar percentage of blasts has prompted us to investigate new objective, independent prognostic parameters for the selection of high-risk patients. It was suggested that CD34 antigen expression adversely affected the prognosis of acute myelogenous leukemia. However, no study has been published so far on clinical and prognostic significance of CD34 antigen expression in MDS. Bone marrow biopsies from 58 patients diagnosed as primary MDS were studied using QBEND/10, a monoclonal antibody which recognized the human progenitor CD34 antigen on routine aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. The high percentage of CD34-positive cells (above 3% of total bone marrow nucleated cells) was predominantly observed in cases with RAEB-T, CMML, and to a lesser degree in RAEB. But neither age, hemograms, bone marrow findings including percentage of blasts, ALIP, nor leukemic transformation correlated with the percentage of CD34-positive cells. The median actuarial survival time in the high positive group was significantly shorter (12.0 months) than that of the low group (30.0 months; p = 0.028). The high CD34 aggregate (> or = 3) was selectively found in cases with RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML. The percentage of bone marrow blasts (p = 0.007) and ALIP (p = 0.030) significantly correlated with number of CD34 aggregates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
