For patients with acute myeloid leukemia refractory to intensive chemotherapy prognosis is very poor and treatment options are limited. 5-Azacytidine, a demethylating drug, is effective in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes when administered at a low-dose, subcutaneously. We report a case of a patient with AML refractory to induction chemotherapy as well as to two high-dose salvage regimens. The patient achieved CR through monotherapy with low-dose azacytidine.
