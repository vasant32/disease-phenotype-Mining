To clarify which is preferable, a related donor with an HLA-1 Ag mismatch at the HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-DR loci in the graft-versus-host (GVH) direction (RD/1AG-MM-GVH) or an HLA 8/8-allele (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1)-matched unrelated donor (8/8-MUD), we evaluated 779 patients with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome who received a T cell-replete graft from an RD/1AG-MM-GVH or 8/8-MUD. The use of an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor was significantly associated with a higher overall mortality rate than the use of an 8/8-MUD in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.49; P < .001), and this impact was statistically significant only in patients with standard-risk diseases (P = .001). Among patients with standard-risk diseases who received transplantation from an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor, the presence of an HLA-B Ag mismatch was significantly associated with a lower overall survival rate than an HLA-DR Ag mismatch because of an increased risk of treatment-related mortality. The HLA-C Ag mismatch or multiple allelic mismatches were frequently observed in the HLA-B Ag-mismatched group, and were possibly associated with the poor outcome. In conclusion, an 8/8-MUD should be prioritized over an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor during donor selection. In particular, an HLA-B Ag mismatch in the GVH direction has an adverse effect on overall survival and treatment-related mortality in patients with standard-risk diseases.
