Mutations of the ten eleven translocation 2 gene (TET2) have recently been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms. We analyzed the incidence and prognostic value of TET2 point mutations and other genomic alterations by direct sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis in 111 de novo acute myeloid leukemia, who had all achieved complete remission (CR). Mutations were observed in 19 (17%) of the 111 patients compared with 10 (27%) of 36 patients who had failed to achieve CR (P = .2). In the 111 patients who had achieved CR, TET2 alterations were only significantly associated with NPM1 mutations but not with other pretreatment characteristics. TET2 gene status was not significantly correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival, both in the entire cohort and in patients with normal karyotype.
