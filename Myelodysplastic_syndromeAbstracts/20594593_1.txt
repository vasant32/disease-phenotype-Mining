Recent data suggest that proper assessment of comorbidities is useful to predict the outcome of MDS patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, the results obtained in this highly selected subset of patients cannot be applied to the whole MDS population. We evaluated the impact of comorbidities in 418 consecutive MDS patients diagnosed at our institute from 1992 to 2005. All patients were classified according to WHO criteria and all received only conservative and supportive treatment. One or more comorbidities were detected in 390 patients (93%) at the time of diagnosis, with a higher incidence in older patients. Cardiac diseases were the most frequent comorbidities (30%) while diabetes and correlated adverse events were the second cause of comorbidity (20%). We applied 3 comorbidity prognostic scores (CCI, HCT-CI and a MDS-CI score proposed by Della Porta et al.). According to CCI score, 253 patients had a score 0, 111 patients had a score 1 and 54 patients had a score >2. According to HCT-CI, 209 patients had a score 0, 105 patients had a score 1 and 106 patients had a score >2. With MDS-CI score, 288 patients had a score 0 and 129 patients had a score >1. We found a significant correlation between survival and stratification according to CCI and MDS-CI scores (p=0.01 and 0.02, respectively), but not according to HCT-CI score. The number of comorbidities as evaluated according to CCI was directly correlated to the development of RBC transfusion-dependency and was associated to a significantly higher risk of death not related to leukemic evolution (HR = 2.12, p â‰¤ 0.001). Conversely, higher risk of non-leukemic death did not correlate with higher transfusional requirement according to HCT-CI and MDS-CI scores (p = 0.3 and 0.43, respectively). As suggested by Della Porta et al., also in our experience the presence of cardiac, liver, renal, pulmonary diseases and solid tumours was found to independently affect the risk of death in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (p values from <0.01 to 0.004). In conclusion, assessment of comorbidities at diagnosis in MDS patients may improve the ability of therapeutic decisions.
