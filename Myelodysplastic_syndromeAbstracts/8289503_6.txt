A simplified technique for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the prevalence of chromosomally abnormal clones in 13 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Biotinylated centromeric probes for chromosomes 7, 8, 12 and X, as well as painting probes for chromosomes 7 and 11, were applied to air-dried bone marrow smears stored from 6 to 23 months. Nine of the cases had been previously karyotyped, and five of these demonstrated normal karyotypes which were confirmed by FISH. The remaining four cases showed different chromosome changes. One case of sideroblastic anemia with chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed minor clones with either monosomy 12 (12% of cells) or tetraploidy (15% of cells) by FISH, whereas metaphase cytogenetics had demonstrated trisomy 12 in 20% of cells, with no evidence of tetraploidy. Another case which had been previously karyotyped was found to have a t(7;11) in 90% of cells while only 10% of cells were shown by FISH to contain this translocation. Monosomy 7 was demonstrated by FISH in a case of refractory anemia (RA), while trisomy 8 was found in a case of RA with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and in both of these cases the aneuploid clone was present in eosinophils as well as in erythroid and granulocytic precursors but not in lymphocytes or histiocytes, thereby demonstrating the value of FISH for identifying the affected cell lineage.
