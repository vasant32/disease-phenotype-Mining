OBJECTIVE: To diagnose equivocal aplastic anemia(AA) patients by the combination of clinical data and bone marrow scintigraphy. METHODS: Bone marrow scintigraphy using 99mTc-sulfer colloid 370-550 MBq was analysed in 47 patients, including 28 cases of AA, 12 of myelodysplastic syndromes(10 MDS-RA and 2 MDS-RAEB) and 7 of AA-PNH syndrome. RESULTS: Pancytopenia, hypercellular bone marrow associated with uneven disappearance of marrow image or focal hematopoiesis were found in 28 AA and 2 of 30 MDS-RA cases. Marrow imaging showed uneven low accumulation of radioactivity in 12 and focal patterns in 18 patients. Normal or high activity and expanded periphery of bone marrow was found in MDS patients (8 RA and 2 RAEB cases). Changes of activity and distribution of bone marrow during the transforming course were noticed in 4 AA-PNH syndrome patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patch distribution and focal hemopoiesis is the outstanding features of AA marrow. The imaging features as well as expanded manner and increased activity of bone marrow are helpful to the differential diagnosis, evaluation of clinical status and explanation of marrow aspirate results.
