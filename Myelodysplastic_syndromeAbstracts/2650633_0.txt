Results of our study on the activation of N-ras oncogene by point mutation in human leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome have been described in this article. Point mutation was observed mainly on the 12th, 13th and 61st amino acid codon of ras genes. Therefore, oligomers containing mutations at these codons were used as probes for dot blot analysis of DNA derived from patient's bone marrow cells or leukemia cells. Polymerase chain reaction technique was used to amplify the DNA of ras genes containing 12th, 13th and 61st codons. By this technique, sensitivity of the method to detect the point mutations in ras oncogene was remarkably increased. Detection of the mutation in ras gene is considered to be very useful for the diagnosis, determination of remission and finding of relapse at an early stage. Study on the fused gene of bcr-abl, its mRNA and protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia is a good and reliable method to prove the existence of Ph1 positive chromosome by gene technology. Identification of the Ph1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has become possible by studying abl oncogene in Ph1 positive ALL. This method can be used also for the diagnosis of Ph1 ALL.
