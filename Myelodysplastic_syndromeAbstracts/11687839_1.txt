We studied functional disturbances in hemopoietic microenvironment and cytokine production by stromal sublayer in long-term bone marrow cultures and peripheral blood macrophages from patients with various forms of myelodysplastic syndrome. Production of factors stimulating the growth of normal erythroid and granulocytic precursors by cells of the stromal sublayer from patients with refractory sideroblast anemia and refractory anemia with excess blasts is impaired compared to cells from healthy donors. The medium conditioned by macrophages from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia displayed a higher ability to stimulate the growth of granulocytes and macrophages compared to media conditioned by cells from donors and patients with refractory sideroblast anemia and refractory anemia with excess blasts. Cultured stromal cells and macrophages produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Their content in media conditioned by cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome surpassed that in healthy donors. Our results suggest that production of cytokines by stromal microenvironmental cells is impaired in patients with various forms of myelodysplastic syndrome.
