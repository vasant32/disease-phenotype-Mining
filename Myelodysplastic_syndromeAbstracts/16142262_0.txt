Hemopoietic precursors from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were characterized by lower adhesion to normal stromal sublayer compared to bone marrow precursors from healthy donors, while adhesion to fibroblast monolayer and fibronectin was similar in bone marrow cells from patients and donors. In vitro experiments showed that the percentage of adherent hemopoietic precursors from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in normal stromal sublayer and fibroblasts was lower compared to healthy donors. The decrease in adhesive activity of hemopoietic precursors from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome probably contributes to impairment of cell-cell interactions in the bone marrow of these patients.
