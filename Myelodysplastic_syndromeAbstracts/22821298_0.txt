The survival rate of children and adolescents suffering acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been significantly improved within the last decades. This has been achieved by a continuously intensified therapy and progress in supportive care to prevent and treat complications. In Germany, the AML-BFM trials 98 (n=413) and 2004 (n=499) enrolled 912 children and adolescents as protocol patients (1998-2010). The 5-year-overall survival was 71±2%. In the previous studies prognosis and subsequent treatment stratification based on morphology, cytochemistry and white blood cell count. Today, the identification of new genetic aberrations in AML enables a genetically determined estimation of prognosis, although treatment response must be considered for treatment stratification. The group with a favorable prognosis summarized AML with t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), t(1;11), and AML with normal karyotype and NPM1-mutation (n=253; EFS 74±3%, OS 88±2%). A poor prognosis (HR-group) must be expected in AML with t(4;11), t(5;11), t(6;11), t(6;9), t(7;12), t(9;22), Monosomy 7, combined FLT3/WT1-mutation, and AML with der(12p)-aberration (n=101; EFS 30±5%; OS 56±5%). The intermediate group summarizes all other subgroups especially AML with normal karyotyp, AML with FLT3-ITD or t(9;11) (n=558; EFS 43±2%; OS 64±2%). The validation of the internationally identified, genetically determined prognostic factors within the AML-BFM (Germany) study population will support treatment recommendations.
