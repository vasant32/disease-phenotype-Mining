Kinesin-like proteins are microtubule-associated motors that play important roles in intracellular transport and cell division. We report here the characterization of a new human kinesin-like protein, Rabkinesin6 (RAB6KIFL). The composite cDNA sequence is 2957bp, and encodes a protein of 890 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 100kDa. It has high homology (93% similarity) with the mouse kinesin-like protein, Rab6kifl, indicating that it is the human homologue of the mouse gene. RAB6KIFL has all of the structural characteristics required to function as a microtubule-associated motor. Unlike the mouse gene which is ubiquitously expressed, RAB6KIFL expression appears to be tissue specific. It is widely expressed in fetal tissues, abundantly expressed in adult thymus, bone marrow and testis, and is expressed at low levels in heart, placenta and spleen. The RAB6KIFL gene is mapped to human chromosome 5, band q31, spans approximately 8.5kb of genomic DNA, and contains 19 exons. RAB6KIFL maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in myeloid leukemias characterized by a deletion of 5q; however, we detected no mutations of RAB6KIFL in malignant myeloid disorders with loss of 5q. The description of this human kinesin-like protein may provide a better understanding of the diversity of this large family of proteins.
