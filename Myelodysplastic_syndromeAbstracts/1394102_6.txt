The karyotypes of 98 patients between the ages of 8 and 81 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are presented. Although the well-described cytogenetic abnormalities associated with particular FAB subtypes in the West were observed, certain important local differences were noted. In ALL, hyperdiploidy was rarely observed, whereas the Philadelphia chromosome was observed in 50% of abnormal karyotypes. In AML, the t(8;21) was infrequently observed in M2 case, whereas trisomy 4 and 6, rarely reported elsewhere, formed 12% of the abnormal cases. In MDS, the incidence of -5/5q- and/or -7/7q- was 83% of cases with aberrant cytogenetic findings. Neither i(17q) nor an extra Ph was seen in 26 cases of CML including 9 cases of accelerated phase/blast crisis. In addition, previously unreported cytogenetic abnormalities occurring as single cases are presented. These findings are discussed in the context of geographical heterogeneity of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemia and emphasize the importance of continued epidemiologic studies of cytogenetics in hematologic malignancies.
