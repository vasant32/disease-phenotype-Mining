The association of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with auto-immune diseases and humoral disorders have already been reported. In this prospective study we tried to estimate type and the frequency of immunological associated diseases among patients affected by MDS. PATIENTS-METHODS: In this prospective study, auto-immune disease and humoral immunity disorders were systematically searched during MDS and conversely MDS searched during cytopenia. All MDS secondary to chemotherapy and the children's MDS were excluded. The MDS diagnosis was established according to FAB criteria and patients were classified in two groups A or B according to presence (group A) or not (group B) of dysimmune manifestations. RESULTS: Forty patients(19 males and 21 females, mean age of 56,6 years) with MDS have been enrolled during this period (group A: 20 patients). Associated diseases are following: systemic lupus erythematosus (three), lupus-like syndrome(one), sarcoidisis(one), SjogrÃ«n syndrome(one), polyarthritis (two), chronic liver diseases (three), autoimmune thyroid diseases (two), pyoderma gangrenosum (one), Crohn's disease(one), haemolytic anaemia (one), and pericardial effusion(one). CONCLUSION: A wide spectrum of auto-immune manifestations is frequently reported in myelodysplastic syndromes. Further studies are necessary for discuss the current physiopathological hypothesis with their therapeutic relevance.
