 BACKGROUND: ARRY-520 selectively inhibits the mitotic kinesin spindle protein (KSP), which leads to abnormal monopolar spindle formation and apoptosis. METHODS: A phase 1 trial was conducted to establish the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ARRY-520 given as a 1-hour infusion in either a single dose or on a day 1, 3, and 5 divided-dose schedule per cycle in patients with advanced or refractory myeloid leukemias. Additional objectives were to characterize pharmacokinetics, assess preliminary clinical activity, and explore biomarkers of KSP inhibition with ARRY-520. A total of 36 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 34) or myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 2) with a median age of 66 years (range, 21-88 years) were enrolled: 15 in the single-dose schedule (dose levels: 2.5, 3.75, 4.5, and 5.6 mg/m(2)) and 21 in the divided-dose schedule (dose levels: 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/m(2)/day). RESULTS: The MTD was 4.5 mg/m(2) total dose per cycle for both dose schedules. Dose-limiting toxicities included mucositis, exfoliative rash, hand-foot syndrome, and hyperbilirubinemia. Grades 3 or 4 reversible drug-related myelosuppression were observed in 33 of 36 patients. Plasma pharmacokinetic analyses revealed low clearance of ARRY-520 (~3 L/hour), a volume of distribution of ~450 L, and a median terminal half-life of >90 hours. Monopolar spindles were observed in blood mononuclear cells, through use of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain and antitubulin antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the relative lack of clinical activity, further development of ARRY-520 as an antileukemic agent was halted. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00637052).
