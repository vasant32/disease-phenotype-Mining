Karyotype status and complexity are key components of the IPSS; however, emerging data suggest the use of cytogenetics at disease presentation is not applied uniformly among MDS patients. To investigate the degree of consistency of scoring karyotypes, the International Working Group on MDS Cytogenetics (IWGMC) conducted a survey of 32 abnormal karyotype challenges carried out in two phases: (a) an initial survey without any specified karyotype counting guidelines and (b) a second survey conducted after the development of IWGMC consensus guidelines for scoring karyotype complexity. Results indicate that IWGMC guidelines were simple and clear for the cytogeneticists in scoring karyotype complexity, but not as clear for the hematologists. We propose an immediate need for standardized international karyotype counting practices and a corresponding IPSS cytogenetic risk that can be incorporated into the cytogenetics reports of all newly diagnosed MDS patients.
