Somatic mutation of the AML1/RUNX1(RUNX1) gene is seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M0 subtype and in AML transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome, but the impact of this gene mutation on survival in AML patients remains unclear. In this study, we sought to determine the clinical implications of RUNX1 mutations in 470 adult patients with de novo non-M3 AML. Sixty-three distinct RUNX1 mutations were identified in 62 persons (13.2%); 32 were in N-terminal and 31, C-terminal. The RUNX1 mutation was closely associated with male sex, older age, lower lactic dehydrogenase value, French-American-British M0/M1 subtypes, and expression of HLA-DR and CD34, but inversely correlated with CD33, CD15, CD19, and CD56 expression. Furthermore, the mutation was positively associated with MLL/PTD but negatively associated with CEBPA and NPM1 mutations. AML patients with RUNX1 mutations had a significantly lower complete remission rate and shorter disease-free and overall survival than those without the mutation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RUNX1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival. Sequential analysis in 133 patients revealed that none acquired novel RUNX1 mutations during clinical courses. Our findings provide evidence that RUNX1 mutations are associated with distinct biologic and clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in patients with de novo AML.
