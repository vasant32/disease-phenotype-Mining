 BACKGROUND: Patients not fulfilling minimal criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but presenting with persisting cytopenia(s) not attributable to a haematological or non-haematological disease are defined as 'idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance' (ICUS). Design AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 67 of 3504 patients from our MDS Registry fulfilling the criteria for ICUS. Furthermore, we used the human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) to look for clonality. RESULTS: Of all 67 patients, 66% had unilineage, 18% bilineage and 12% trilineage cytopenias. The majority of patients (67%) presented with anaemia. Median overall survival was 44 months (range: 1-199 months). In the entire group, eight patients (12%) developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Of the 23 patients eligible for HUMARA, 17 had non-clonal X-chromosome inactivation patterns, while 6 patients showed clonal patterns. Two of these six patients developed AML indicating that a clonal stem cell disorder was the reason for the anteceding cytopenia, while there was no AML observed among the 17 patients with non-clonal patterns (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Since some of the ICUS patients had a clonal bone marrow disease when presenting with cytopenia(s) and 8 of 67 patients with ICUS later developed AML, we recommend to follow these patients thoroughly. As demonstrated here, HUMARA can facilitate the discrimination between ICUS and a 'manifest' MDS.
