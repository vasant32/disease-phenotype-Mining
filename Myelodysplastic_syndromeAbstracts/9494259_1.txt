INTRODUCTION: The myelodysplastic syndromes (MSD) are a group of hematologic disorders that manifest dysplastic hematopoiesis and usually a hypercellular bone marrow. Ineffective hematopoiesis leads to haematologic failure in these syndromes. The MDS are a rare event during pregnancy although the exact incidence is unknown it is likely to be less than that for leukaemia. CLINICAL REPORT: The case, a 29 year old woman, presented during 23rd week of her first, triplet, pregnancy with symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia is described. DISCUSSION: The pathogenetic aspect and diagnostic management is discussed, underlined especially under the point of view of the triplet pregnancy. It is suggested that the association of myelodysplastic syndromes during pregnancy is coincidental and that acute leukemia evolves in a majority of these cases. Furthermore, refractory macrocytic anemias in pregnancy need to be carefully evaluated for a primary myelodysplastic state.
