Lenalidomide is the first drug to induce transfusion independence and cytogenetic remission in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with deletion 5q and low or intermediate risk score. Transfusion independence can be obtained within five weeks. Three out of four patients also obtain a cytogenetic response to treatment. However, concern has arisen about the possibility of an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. A multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled study with long-term follow-up is needed.
