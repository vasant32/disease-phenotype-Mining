We analysed T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable region (TCRAV) and T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCRBV) repertoires in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 34 recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), seven of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and 19 of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using the quantitative microplate hybridization assay. TCR usage skewed at an early period (6-7 weeks) after BMT. The change was more apparent in allogeneic recipients than in autologous recipients. In particular, a predominant increase was detected in the frequency of VA1-4 (26%, 11 of 41 recipients), VA3-1 (32%) and VB24-1 (28%). Interestingly, acidic amino acid residues frequently followed the arginine residue in complementarity-determining region 3 of BV24S1. We further examined the extent of skew using samples obtained at serial time points after transplantation. The normalization of skewed repertoires occurred over a long period of time (> 8 years). There was a significant difference in the rate of normalization of skewed TCR repertoires between adult and child recipients (P < 0.05). The results suggest that these T cells may have expanded in response to allogeneic antigens, such as miHA (minor histocompatibility antigen), and that altered repertoires are eventually normalized by T-cell regeneration via a thymic-dependent pathway in children.
