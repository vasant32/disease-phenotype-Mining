Patients who have recovered from malignant lymphoma are at an increased risk of secondary acute leukemia (AL), and overt AL is frequently preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome. Although the statistical risk is significant, only a minority of the patients will be so affected. We have reviewed peripheral blood counts of patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated in the Departments of Hematology at the Edith Wolfson and Chaim Sheba Medical Centers, Israel. Included were only those who went into a complete remission and remained lymphoma free for extended periods. There were 85 patients with HD and 36 with NHL. In both groups peripheral blood counts at diagnosis were within the normal range. A prolonged follow-up (> 4 y), during which no further treatment was given, revealed a sustained increment over time of MCV (delta MCV) both in HD and NHL. A persistent monocytosis in HD patients was also evident. delta MCV was larger in HD. The difference at the end of the follow-up period was as follows: 10.1 fl + 11.8 in HD vs 5.0 fl + 6.2 in NHL, (P < 0.001). In addition, a significant loss of the normal correlation between the MCV and levels of hemoglobin was seen at the last follow-up. The change in MCV was present in all treatment groups, its magnitude increasing from radiotherapy to chemotherapy to combined radio chemotherapy. This trend is in analogy to the risk of secondary AL which is lower in NHL vs HD. Furthermore, it is lowest post radiotherapy and highest when both treatment modalities are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
