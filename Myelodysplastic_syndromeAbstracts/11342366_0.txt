Hyperhomocysteinemia (HH) has been associated with cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases and oxidative cell damage. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are associated with autoimmunity (AI) and increased oxidative stress. We tested the association of HH and oxidative stress in 33 MDS patients, by measuring plasma homocysteine and malondialdehyde (MDA). HH was found in 42% of cases, (4/5) cases with associated cardiovascular events (CVE)(80%), and 9/15 cases with associated AI (60%). Thus in MDS, HH was significantly associated with AI/CVE (chi(2) : p=0.0011), and this association seems to be specific, as demonstrated by the comparison of MDS presenting AI/CVE with the ischemic cardiopathy/rheumatoid arthritis control group (13/20, 65% vs 19/69, 27%; chi(2) : p=0.0021). The levels of MDA indicated increased oxidative stress. Our data may suggest that in a subset of MDS, HH may simultaneously contribute to bone marrow myelodysplasia, CVE and AI pathogenesis, possibly through oxidative cell damage.
