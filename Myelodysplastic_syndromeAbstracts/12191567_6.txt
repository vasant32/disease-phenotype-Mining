Forty-five patients with high-risk myeloid malignancies (32 acute myeloid leukemia and 13 high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes) were treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, and G-CSF (FLAG-IDA). Twenty-four (53%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), and five (11%) partial remission. Infection predominantly with pulmonary involvement was the most common regimen-related toxicity. Mucositis (15 patients) and pulmonary toxicity (19 patients) were the most frequently observed non-hematologic side effects. There were four early deaths and 12 patients presented with resistant disease. Overall survival (OS) at 12 months was 40%. The FLAG-IDA regimen shows evident antileukemic activity in patients with high-risk myeloid malignancies with acceptable toxicity.
