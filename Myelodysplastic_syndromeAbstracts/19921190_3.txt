It has been suggested that Asian and Western myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients have different cytogenetic and prognostic features. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and cytogenetic data from 435 Chinese adult primary MDS patients. In addition, we evaluated the prognostic value of the World Health Organization classification as well as six prognostic scoring systems in these patients. The median follow-up time was 25.1 months (5.5-53.2). Of the 435 patients, 186 (42.8%) had died and 40 (9.2%) had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Multivariate analysis identified older age, higher percent of marrow blasts, and poor-risk IPSS cytogenetics as characteristics associated with worse survival and higher risk of leukemia transformation. Low platelets, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume were independent factors associated only with worse survival. Among the 424 patients in whom the results of cytogenetic analyses were available, 164 (38.7%) showed karyotypic abnormalities. Incidence of trisomy 8 was common but sole del(5q) was rare in Chinese MDS patients. For predicting survival, most scoring systems were meaningful for stratifying patients into different subgroups, with the exception of the WPSS scoring system. For predicting leukemia evolution, the Spanish scoring system was most effective. Patients with RAEB-2 showed different prognoses from those with RAEB-1. However, there was no significant difference in prognoses between patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) from RA or RARS. In summary, this analysis indicated the presence of a different cytogenetic pattern as well as prognostic features in Chinese MDS patients.
