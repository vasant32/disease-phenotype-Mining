Ten characteristics of bone marrow (BM) biopsies in paraffin sections, obtained at diagnosis from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) classified according to the FAB criteria, were analysed to identify both the most relevant morphologic data and any possible influence on survival. Agreement between two observers was obtained for 94% of the data. BM cellularity was increased in 63% of the cases and was higher in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (P = 0.001). Dysmegakaryopoiesis and dyserythropoiesis were present respectively in 83% and 72% of the cases, with slight differences among the FAB subtypes. Abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) was found in more than half of the cases and somewhat more frequently seen in the RAEB + RAEB-t + CMML group (P = 0.07). Eosinophilia, plasmacytosis and reticulin fibrosis were evident in 26%, 18% and 47% of the cases respectively. Cellularity (P = 0.006), eosinophilia (P = 0.009) and, to some extent, dysmegakaryopoiesis (P = 0.07) bore a certain relationship with survival on univariate analysis. The presence of ALIP was not seen to affect the outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that the cellularity and presence of dysmegakaryopoiesis, in BM biopsy, added significant independent prognostic information to that achieved with age, platelet count and proportion of blast cells in BM aspirate, three variables with proven prognostic value in MDS patients. Using a regression model including these five characteristics we have stratified the patients into low, intermediate and high-risk groups with different survivals (P = 0.00001). The present findings show that BM biopsy is able to provide both morphological characteristics and information about the prognosis of survival, and should thus be included in the initial evaluation of MDS.
