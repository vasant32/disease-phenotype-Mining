Molecular epidemiological studies have found new insights into the etiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We analyzed the polymorphisms of 5 genes in 275 patients with primary MDS and 354 healthy controls in an attempt to identify candidate genetic risk factors for primary MDS in Chinese Han population. There was no difference in polymorphic variants of GSTM1, NQO1-C609T and XRCC3-C241T between the patients and controls. The homozygous variant C/C of RAD51-G135C was found to increase the susceptibility to MDS (OR, 4.13; p=0.001) and the risk of MDS association with structural abnormal karyotype (OR, 7.67; p=0.001). In addition, the null genotype of GSTT1 was correlated MDS patients with complex aberrant karyotype (OR, 3.25; p=0.012). These potential genetic predisposition suggested their possible involvement in the multistep pathogenesis of MDS.
