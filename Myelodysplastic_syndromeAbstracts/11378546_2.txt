We describe the cytogenetic findings of three cases with simultaneous or sequential development of a B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and either a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 2 cases or a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in one case. The coexistence of these two hematologic malignancies leads to questions about their cell of origin. Through analysis of the cytogenetic abnormalities, we studied the derivation of both malignancies. The cytogenetic analyses of these three patients were simultaneously studied from both peripheral blood and bone marrow. Furthermore unstimulated short-time (USSTC) and long-time (72-96 hours) stimulated cultures (LTSC) were systematically performed. In all cases, we have demonstrated the independent bi-clonal evolution. This is the first report ever described for patients with CLPD and MDS and/or MPD shown to arise from distinct chromosomal abnormalities.
