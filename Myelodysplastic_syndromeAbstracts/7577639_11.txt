The proto-oncogene, c-kit, encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (KIT) and plays an important role in haemopoiesis. We have identified a 95 kD soluble form of KIT (S-KIT) in culture supernatant of human megakaryoblastic cell line, CMK. To study the physiological significance of S-KIT, we have established a sensitive sandwich ELISA system. Serum samples from healthy individuals contained detectable amounts of S-KIT. Next, we determined a total of 220 samples from 134 patients with haemopoietic disorders. A considerable number of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), especially those with more immature phenotypes (M0, M1 or M2) had elevated levels of serum S-KIT. Those levels decreased to the normal range after effective chemotherapy. In chronic myeloid leukaemia, patients with myeloid blastic crisis showed markedly elevated levels of serum S-KIT. In contrast, S-KIT levels decreased in cases with either acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. There was a tendency for patients with severe aplastic anaemia to show decreased levels, but it was not significant. In myelodysplastic syndrome, S-KIT levels appeared to vary by subsets, with higher concentration in more advanced forms of the disease. Although the functional role of S-KIT is not yet elucidated, these results suggest that the serum S-KIT levels may reflect the pathological states of various haematological disorders.
