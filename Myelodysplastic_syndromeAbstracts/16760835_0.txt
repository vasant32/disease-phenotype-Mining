BACKGROUND: Cutaneous involvement in patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is often poorly specific for maculopapular eruptions. We report an atypical case of neutrophilic disorder associating subcorneal pustules and hypodermal nodules in a male patient with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. CASE REPORT: A 62 year-old man with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy was treated with oral prednisone (15 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide. Pustules and deep nodules occurred simultaneously on the arms and trunk, the abdomen and the back respectively. Biopsy of these lesions showed an infiltration of neutrophil polymorphonuclears in the median and superficial dermis with a subcorneal pustule and nodular infiltration of neutrophil polymorphonuclears in the deep dermis and hypodermis respectively. Increasing the dose of prednisone to 30 mg/day led to rapid and complete healing of the cutaneous lesions. DISCUSSION: This atypical case of neutrophilic disorder associating acute subcorneal pustules and deep dermal-hypodermal nodules seems to correspond to a unique type of neutrophilic disorder that differs from those previously reported in the literature. Neutrophilic disorders have been reported only rarely in patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. This case illustrates the wide range of clinical and histological lesions found in neutrophilic disorders, a number of which may coexist in a single patient.
