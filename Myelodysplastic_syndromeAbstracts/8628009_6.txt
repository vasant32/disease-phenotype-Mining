Microsatellites are highly polymorphic, short-tandem repeat sequences dispersed throughout the genome. Instability of these repeat sequences at multiple gentic loci may result from mismatch repair errors and occur in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and several other sporadic cancers, including chronic myelocytic leukemia as it progresses to blastic crisis. We investigated whether genetic instability occurred as myelodysplasia progressed to acute myelocytic leukemia. To this end, we studied microsatellite instability in 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These included five patients with refractory anemia (RA), three with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblast (RARS), nine with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and three with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). All of these patients transformed to acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) of various subtypes: three patients with M1, 11 with M2 and six patients with M4 (according to FAB classification). The DNA from both the MDS and AML phases of their disease was analyzed at 16 loci, and only four microsatellite instabilities were found in the 240 paired samples (1.6%) analyzed. These results indicate that mismatch repair errors such as microsatellite instability are not important in the evolution of MDS to AML.
