We report 6 patients with myelodysplasia who, on routine cytogenetic studies, demonstrated trisomy 15. Four of these also had sex chromosome loss. A review of the literature revealed 6 other cases of trisomy 15 with sex chromosome loss and 22 cases of trisomy 15 as the sole chromosomal abnormality. All cases had hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasia. Trisomy 15 is uncommon but tends to be associated with myelodysplasia in older subjects, and with sex chromosome loss in about one third of cases.
