Human recombinant stem cell factor (rSCF) was tested for its capability of improving the defective growth of hemopoietic progenitors in 28 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In vitro growth and response to rSCF were quite variable. However, in most cases, rSCF stimulated CFU-GM growth induced by rG-CSF, rGM-CSF, rIL-3, 5637 conditioned medium (50-1400% enhancement). rSCF effect was slightly more evident on day 14 CFU-GM and in the presence of rIL-3. BFU-E growth induced by rEPO or rIL-3 + rEPO was enhanced by rSCF in about 50% of cases, in linear correlation with the levels of patients' hemoglobin. rSCF did not increase CFU-E growth, whereas it slightly stimulated CFU-Mk in 33% of the cases. EPO, SCF and, particularly, their combination, enhanced the recovery of normal CFU-E and BFU-E after 7 days of liquid culture. This was less evident in cultures of MDS patients. Conversely, CFU-GM generation in long term liquid cultures, although highly variable, was stimulated by rSCF and, above all, by rSCF + rG-CSF, similarly to what was observed with normal bone marrow samples. SCF seems to enhance in vitro erythropoiesis only in MDS cases presenting without severe anemia. It has little effect on megakaryocytopoiesis, while it seems to be more active on CFU-GM growth and maintenance.
