A 79-year-old male with unstable angina, who had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), was treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). MDS causes refractory anemia accompanied by various degrees of granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia caused by MDS may complicate patients with major infections and bleeding during cardiac surgery. There were very few patients with MDS who had undergone open-heart surgery. Three case studies, including this study, had reported successful cases of CABG in patients with MDS and the analogous diseases of MDS. We used granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets transfusions in peri-operative state. We did not need a large amount of transfusion of RBCs and platelets in intra-operative and postoperative states. We had prevented major bleeding and severe wound infections in the acute postoperative state.
