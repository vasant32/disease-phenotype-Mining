A t(16;21) (q24;122) translocation was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia previously treated for malignant lymphoma. While the breakpoint on chromosome 21 was within the AML1 gene as determined by FISH, the gene partner on chromosome 16 could not be identified. Band 16q24 appears to be rearranged in several types of myeloid proliferation and a review of the literature shows that these rearrangements most often occur in secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome or are part of complex chromosomal rearrangements.
