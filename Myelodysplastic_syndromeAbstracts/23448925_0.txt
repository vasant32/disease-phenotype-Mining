Epigenetic research plays an important role in the malignant tumor genotyping and tumor clinical treatment recently. Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications often occurring on the cytosine of CpG islands located in gene promoter regions, which is thought to be closely correlated with tumorigenesis. The inducibility and reversibility of DNA methylation provide us an insight into tumor development and treatment. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is associated with the progress of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacytidine and decitabine) have achieved suc-cess in treating high-and intermediate-risk MDS. This will bring new ideas to understand the cause and develop the treat-ment of MDS. This review mainly introduces the latest progress of the action mechanism of those two medicines, the clini-cal effect and new problems during the clinical application on MDS.
