Forty patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndromes--refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia--were treated with subcutaneous low dose cytosine arabinoside, 10 mg/m2 twice daily for up to 42 days. In 38 evaluable patients there were nine (24%) complete and four (11%) partial responses. Response was associated with symptomatic improvement and resolution of the need for red cell and platelet transfusions. The median duration of complete response was 9.8 months (range, 2.4-17.9); these patients had a median survival of 15.7 months (range, 6.0-22.7). Toxicities were predominantly those associated with pancytopenia, i.e., infection and hemorrhage.
