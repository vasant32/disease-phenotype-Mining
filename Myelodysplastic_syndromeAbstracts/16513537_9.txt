A nationwide survey of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was started in Japan in 1991, and the analyzed survey data have been presented as the annual report of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The 10-year overall survival (OS) rates after HCT for each disease are as follows: acute myelogenous leukemia, 44.2%; acute lymphocytic leukemia, 33.7%; adult T-cell leukemia, 24.6%; chronic myelogenous leukemia, 53.3%; myelodysplastic syndrome, 37.3%; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 41.5%; Hodgkin's lymphoma, 50.8%; aplastic anemia, 72.5%; breast cancer, 37.1%; germ cell tumor, 52.6%; and ovarian cancer, 44.2%. The 5-year OS rates for multiple myeloma and lung cancer were 40.6% and 23.6%, respectively. Except in cord blood transplantation, engraftment was accomplished in more than 90% of patients. The respective frequencies of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were 41.1% and 34.9% for related bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 66.8% and 34.5% for unrelated BMT, 52.9% and 36.0% for allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and 53.3% and 32.1% for allogeneic cord blood transplantation. OS for each disease was analyzed by patient age, stem cell source, donor type, disease status, and disease type. These data provide objective and valuable information for hematologists as well as for patients who need HCT.
