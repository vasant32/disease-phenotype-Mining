The diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is based on morphological changes in the blood and bone marrow. The parameters NEUT-X and NEUT-Y of the Sysmex XE-2100 analyzer could help detect neutrophil dysplasia. A control group of 50 patients, along with 50 postpartum patients, 50 anemias, 50 leukopenias, 50 patients with microscopically visible hypergranulated neutrophils and 50 MDS patients were assessed. The NEUT-X and NEUT-Y values (mean +/- SD) for the control group were 1346 +/- 28.2 and 420 +/- 19.3, respectively, with the anemia and leukopenia groups giving similar values. The postpartum and hypergranulated neutrophils groups presented higher values (P < 0.05), whereas the values in the MDS group were 1286 +/- 72.8 and 385 +/- 50.9 (P < 0.05), respectively. There were no differences between the morphological MDS types. The NEUT-X and NEUT-Y values in MDS patients with optical hypogranulation were significantly lower than for MDS patients without optical hypogranulation. NEUT-X and NEUT-Y values lower than 1298 and 398, respectively, would have a specificity for detecting MDS of 94% and 91% and would detect 60% and 56% of cases, respectively, whereas they would detect 75% and 74%, respectively, of MDS cases with optical hypogranulation. NEUT-X and NEUT-Y parameters can be used to detect neutrophil dysplasia arising from MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
