The successful treatment of sarcomas with intensive regimens combining high-dose chemotherapy and irradiation has led to not only improved survival but also to an increased incidence of therapy-related acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We report 4 patients having sarcoma treated with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy who subsequently developed MDS or t-ANLL.
