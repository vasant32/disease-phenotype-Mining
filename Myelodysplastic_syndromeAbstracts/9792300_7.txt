The in vitro growth characteristics of a large series of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and their relationship with other clinical and biological disease characteristics were analysed. Patients with AML were studied, 181 with de novo AML and 45 with secondary AML (24 myelodysplastic syndrome, sAML-MDS, 21 myeloproliferative disorder, sAML-MPD). Leukaemic colony forming units (L-CFU) were assayed by plating peripheral blood (PB) blast cells in methyl-cellulose and using LCM-PHA as stimulant. In each case parallel cultures were made with and without stimulating factors. Plating efficiency (PE) was defined as the number of clusters plus colonies/10(5) cells plated. Autonomous growth (AG) was the number of colonies plus clusters growing without stimulant. The autonomous proliferative index (API) was calculated as the number of clusters + colonies without stimulating factor divided by the number of clusters + colonies with stimulating factor. No significant differences in the PE between de novo and secondary AML were found. Autonomous growth was significantly higher in sAML-MPD. The FAB subtype M3 leukaemias displayed a significantly greater PE and a significantly lower API when compared with the other FAB subgroups (P=0.0002). Upon analysing the relationship with the immunophenotype, only CD33 expression showed a significant relationship with the in vitro growth pattern; CD33+ cases displayed a higher PE (P=0.0002) and AG (P=0.0003) than CD33- cases. When patients were grouped according to the level of rh123 efflux (MDR1) it was observed that cases with >30% elimination showed a higher AG and API than those with <30% (P=0.03). Finally we found that patients with higher API (>0.05) displayed a significantly shorter overall survival as compared with patients with API<0.05 (P=0.04). The in vitro study properties of clonogenic cells produces relevant clinical information of leukaemic cell biology in AML patients.
