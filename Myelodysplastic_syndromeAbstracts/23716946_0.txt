Del(5)(q) is a common chromosomal abnormality with favourable prognosis in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, del(5)(q) is also seen rarely in Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its significance remains poorly understood. We present here, a case report of diagnosis of an adult 75 year old patient of ALL with a cytogenetic abnormality of del(5)(q32). His clinical features, morphology and immunophenotyping findings were suggestive of T-ALL. Relevant literature has been reviewed and discussed.
