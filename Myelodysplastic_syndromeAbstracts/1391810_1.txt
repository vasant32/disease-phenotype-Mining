We present a case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which developed into an overt leukemic phase in a 15-year-old female with a rare constitutional abnormality [46,XX,t(2;11) (q31;p13)]. The patient entered complete remission after 3 months of chemotherapy. On chromosome analysis during remission, the t(2;11) (q31;p13) abnormality was detected in all metaphases of both the bone marrow cells and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Her father also had the same karyotype. This case seems to be of value as a reference for the study of the significance of constitutional chromosome abnormalities in MDS.
