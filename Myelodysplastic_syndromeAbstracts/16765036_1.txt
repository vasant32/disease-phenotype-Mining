Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is known to result from many causes, such as post-bone marrow transplantation, autoimmune and infectious causes, and from drugs. We report a 16-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and referred for pulmonary evaluation prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Her chief complaints were progressive cough and dysponea. Her radiological and pulmonary function tests were highly suggestive of advanced OB, which was confirmed by a lung biopsy. She eventually died despite steroid therapy. The possible aetiology of OB in this patient is discussed, but, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of OB associated with MDS.
