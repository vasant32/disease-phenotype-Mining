The aim of this study was to access average delays for novogeneration of myeloid and lymphoid cells after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) outcome and factors affecting this organization. A prospective analysis over 2 years (01/01/07 to 31/12/08) enrolling 19 children treated with allogeneic intrafamilial bone marrow transplantation. Indications for bone marrow transplantation were: aplastic anemia (3 cases), bemoglobinopathies (9 cases), myelodysplastic syndrome (1 case) and primary immunodeficiency (6 cases). Different conditioning regiments were used according to the indication. The study of immune reconstitution was based on the quantitative determination of immunoglobulin and lymphocyte subpopulation. These tests were routinely requested to 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. The average time of engraftment was 18 days (12-24). A rate of CD4+T lymphocytes>200/mm3 was provided within an average of 2,5 months (1-7). The average time to obtain CD8+T lymphocytes>200/mm3 was 2 months (1-5). The humoral immune reconstitution was made within an average of 2 months (1-4). A report of CD4+/CD8+T lymphocytes>I was obtained within 10 months and a half (1-24). Univaried analysis showed a correlation between the bone marrow sex matched and the faster reorganization of CD8+T cells (p=0.042). A quantity of CD34+>6 10(6)/kg was significantly associated with the recapture of a formula lymphocyte CD4+/CD8+T>1 (p=0.03) Immune recovery post bone marrow transplantation in children begins with myeloid lineage then lymphoid B then lymphoid T The inversion of the report CD4+/CD8+T lymphocytes, seems to be influenced by the high contain of CD34+cells in the graft as well as the type of conditioning.
