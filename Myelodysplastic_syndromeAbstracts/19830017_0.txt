We report an unusual sequence of clinico-pathological manifestations of myelodysplastic syndrome and thymic squamous cell carcinoma. A 77-year-old man with a two-month history of myelodysplastic syndrome was admitted with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Radiological investigations revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, associated with mediastinal haemorrhage. The mass was excised via a standard median sternotomy and was found to be an infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma, which arose from a multilocular thymic cyst.
