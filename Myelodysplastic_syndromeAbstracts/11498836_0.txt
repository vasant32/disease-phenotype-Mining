OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the values of immunophenotyping in the diagnosis and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Surface markers of mononuclear marrow cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for a panel of monoclonal antibodies in 32 patients with MDS. RESULTS: Expression of myeloid antigen increased significantly while lymphoid antigen decreased. The antigen expression was correlated with the FAB subtype of MDS, Immature myeloid cells (CD13+, CD33+) was being increased and the lymphoid antigen expression decreased with the RA/RAS evolving to RAEB and RAEB-t. Compared with normal marrow, the number of CD34+ cells was not significantly different in RA/RAS subtypes but significantly higher in RAEB/RAEB-t subtypes. The expression of early marrow cell antigens (CD38, HLA-DR, CD99R and CD9) was significantly increased. The expression of CD34 and other early antigen was predictive for transformation and poor survival. CONCLUSION: Surface marker analysis of mononuclear marrow cells may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDS.
