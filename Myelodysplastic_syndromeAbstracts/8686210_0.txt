Recombinant erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) was the first growth factor introduced into clinical practice. The main indication for its therapeutic use remains treatment of anaemias during chronic renal failure. In Czech Republic it is at present administered to 55% of patients included in a regular haemodialyzation program and in the pre-dialyzation stage of the disease, consistent with European practice. In addition to a marked improvement of the quality of life, during r-HuEPO treatment also the prevalence of some cardiovascular complications is reduced and immune functions improve. The list of diseases where r-HuEPO therapy is indicated has been, however, extended nowadays. A very favourable effect was recorded in some haematological malignicies and solid tumours. The best results were observed so far in the treatment of anaemia associated with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, and also in malignant lymphomas, carcinoma of the breast and ovary. It is used also in the treatment of suppressed erythropoiesis resulting from cytoreducing therapy. Other indications include anaemia after transplantations of bone marrow, preparation before autologous transfusions and some cases of myelodysplastic syndrome. The authors mention also other contemporary possibilities of r-HuEPO use.
