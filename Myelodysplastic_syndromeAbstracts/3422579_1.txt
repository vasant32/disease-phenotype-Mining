A patient developed a secondary blood disorder 7 years after radiotherapy for a gastric lymphoma. The initial myelodysplastic syndrome evolved to a myeloproliferative phase with transient polycythemia, progressive thrombocythemia, and hyperleukocytosis. Chromosome analysis performed in the terminal phase showed del(5)(q13q31),t(9;22)(q34;q11), and a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes #2 and #3. A correlation between chromosomal abnormalities and hematologic findings could be established. In this case, we have assumed that the Philadelphia translocation is a late event, due to prior mutagen exposure, and its association with a common secondary abnormality (5q-), followed by a progressively developing myeloproliferative phase. Furthermore, the association of Ph and 5q- in a single clone seems to indicate that the same stem cell is affected by these two abnormalities.
