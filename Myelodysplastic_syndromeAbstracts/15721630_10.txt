The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has shown remarkable efficacy in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In a small portion of patients treated with imatinib, however, the disease may progress to advanced stages, frequently accompanied by cytogenetic clonal evolution with the appearance of additional chromosomal aberrations besides the Philadelphia chromosome. Here we report the appearance of an inv(11)(p15q22) as a clonal evolution in a CML patient undergoing treatment with imatinib. Leukemic cells from the patient were found to express the fusion transcript of NUP98 and DDX10, which is in accordance with previously reported cases of de novo or therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome with inv(11)(p15q22). Although the patient showed resistance to imatinib with the disease rapidly progressing to blast crisis, sequence analysis failed to reveal any mutation in the kinase domain of BCR/ABL that would explain the imatinib resistance. Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of leukemic cells with imatinib significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL, a target of the BCR/ABL kinase. These observations raise a possibility that the NUP98/DDX10 fusion might be involved in imatinib resistance as well as in acute transformation of CML.
