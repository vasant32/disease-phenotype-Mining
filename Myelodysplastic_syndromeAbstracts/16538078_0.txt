A 41-year-old patient manifested pancytopenia with macrocytosis following pesticide exposure. She was later found to have myelodysplasia with trisomy 15. Over a 15-year period of observation, and with no specific therapy, her hematological disorder remains stable, despite persistence of the chromosomal aberration. This and similar reported observations suggest that the course of this uncommon form of myelodysplasia is often indolent and not accurately predicted by application of the widely used International Prognostic Scoring System for the myelodysplastic syndromes.
