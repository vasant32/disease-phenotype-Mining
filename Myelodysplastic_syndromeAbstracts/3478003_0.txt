Cytarabine (ara-C) is the first line agent with its excellent activity for acute myelogenous leukemia. Combination therapy of MFC (mitomycin C, 5-FU, ara-C) has been used for GI tract cancer with a synergistic effect on L-1210 mouse leukemia. In the results of research on the administration, a high dose ara-C is an effective agent in the refractory cases to the standard dose ara-C and the combination with daunorubicin is applied to a remission consolidation therapy. A small dose ara-C is used against an atypical leukemia with its mechanism of induction of differenciation. On the other hand, in the development of its derivertive compounds ancitabine or enocitabine (BH-AC) were induced to a treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Especially BH-AC is the first choice agent for acute myelogenous leukemia combined with other agents.
