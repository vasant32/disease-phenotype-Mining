Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R), IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R) and IL-6 receptor alpha subunit (IL-6R) mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 17 patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo BMT) and 2 patients who underwent autologous transplantation were analyzed using a semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). There were several exceptions in some cases and IL-1R expression was found to vary in a rather wide range, however, the expression of IL-2R and IL-6R mRNA tended to increase during the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In particular, IL-2R mRNA expression was increased in four patients with GVHD and graft failure. In contrast, IL-2R and IL-6R mRNA expression was not increased in autologous (auto) BMT and auto peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) patients. These findings suggest that IL-2R and maybe IL-6R mRNA expression in PBMC play an important role in the development of an allo response and GVHD. Therefore, the analysis of cytokine receptor mRNA expression in PBMC after allo BMT may provide important information concerning the immune response and the cytokine network system in marrow transplants.
