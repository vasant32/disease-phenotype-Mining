In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) a normal karyotype by cytogenetic analysis (CA) corresponds to a low cytogenetic risk for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) evolution, a subset of patients however develops AML. We evaluated the use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (I-FISH) in 31 patients with evolution from primary MDS to AML and a normal CA at all stages of disease. Monosomy 7 was found in 4/31 cases, one patient had a terminal deletion 5q, each after AML evolution. The low frequency and unclear prognostic value of I-FISH anomalies in MDS related AML suggests that these alterations play a minor role for AML evolution.
