There is accumulating evidence that the marrow-failure of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is immune-mediated. We studied patients with MDS to look for oligoclonal or clonal expansion in T cells indicative of an autoimmune process. We used a PCR-based technique (spectratyping) to characterize the T cell repertoire in MDS (n=15; 9 RA, 4 RARS, 2 RAEB) and compared results with age-matched healthy donors (n=20) and transfusion-dependent (TD) patients with hemoglobinopathy (n=5). We found a significantly higher number of skewed Vbeta profiles in the MDS patients compared with controls. In peripheral blood T cells, 60/345 Vbeta profiles examined were skewed in MDS patients compared with 3/115 Vbeta profiles in TD controls (P<0.0001), and 58/460 Vbeta profiles in age-matched controls (P=0.05). A study of Jbeta region within the skewed Vbeta profiles revealed preferential usage of Jbeta 2.1 in MDS in contrast with a wide distribution over the entire Jbeta spectrum in controls, consistent with non-random T cell clonal expansion in MDS. These findings provide further evidence that T cell mediated immune processes are a feature of MDS.
