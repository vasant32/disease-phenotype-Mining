The WT1 gene is considered to be highly expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia and is thought to play a key role in maintaining the viability of leukemia cells. However, little is known about the WT1 gene expression levels in pediatric patients with juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia (JMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We studied WT1 expression in diagnostic bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples of 90 patients with JMML, low grade MDS, advanced MDS and myelodysplasia-related AML in BM (n = 20) and PB (n = 18) samples of normal healthy volunteer donors.
