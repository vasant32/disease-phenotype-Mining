Molecularly cloned feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-clone 33 (C-33), derived from a cat with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), was examined to assess its relation to the pathogenesis of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To evaluate in vitro pathogenicity of FeLV C-33, bone marrow colony-forming assay was performed on marrow cells infected with FeLV C-33 or an FeLV subgroup A strain (61E, a molecularly cloned strain with minimal pathogenicity). The myeloid colony-forming activity of feline bone marrow mononuclear cells infected with FeLV C-33 was significantly lower than that of cells infected with 61E. This suggests that FeLV C-33 has myeloid lineage-specific pathogenicity for cats, and that FeLV C-33 infection is useful as an experimental model for investigating pathogenesis of MDS and AML.
