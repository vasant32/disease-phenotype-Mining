Cytogenetic syndrome involving bands 3q21 and 3q26, known as "3q21q26 syndrome" has been observed in adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (0.5-2%), chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (20%), myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. In the present study bone marrow samples from two boys (12 and 16 years), diagnosed with CML and AML respectively, were investigated using conventional cytogenetic methods, interphase "multipoint" fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), dual color-FISH and multiplex FISH. The "multipoint" FISH analysis identified in de novo childhood AML case an inv(3)(q21q26) and a complex 3q rearrangement including inversion and duplication in the CML case. The "3q21q26 syndrome" is associated with normal or elevated platelet counts with marked abnormalities of megakaryocytopoiesis, involvement of multiple hematopoietic lineages. The affected patients were resistant to conventional chemotherapy and had a short survival. This syndrome is very rare in de novo childhood AML, and simultaneous presence of 3q inversion and duplication, to our knowledge, has not yet been identified in hematological malignancies. The results of our study emphasize the importance of classical and modern cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies, because in the majority of cases they can provide additional diagnostic information for the clinicians in deciding the best therapeutic approach, precise classification and prognosis of the disease.
