We report here a patient with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which was complicated with several autoimmune disorders and asymptomatic immunologic abnormalities. An 82-year-old woman with refractory anemia (RA) rapidly developed thrombocytopenia with the appearance of symptoms such as purpura, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. Furthermore, clinical examinations revealed that she also had Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hematological diseases such as thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. However, the cytopenia and all autoimmune disorders were remarkably improved after she received steroid therapy.
