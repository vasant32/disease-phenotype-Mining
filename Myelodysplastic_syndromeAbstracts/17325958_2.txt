A 53-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome developed Sweet's syndrome extensively over his left iliac and inguinal regions that was refractory to standard treatment with corticosteroids and chemotherapy, received a stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor, conditioned by reduced-intensity regimen. The patient achieved complete hematological remission, and the cutaneous lesions improved gradually and then disappeared completely despite the patient receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after transplantation and developing acute graft-versus-host disease.
