Myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemias after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (HD) are well recognized. Preleukemic changes are commonly seen. Three patients from the authors' files are found with myelofibrosis and bone marrow lymphocytosis after treatment for HD. Although somewhat unusual, the clinical impression initially was, in each case, isolated recurrence of HD involving the bone marrow, 6 to 11 years after initial diagnosis. In each case, after single or multiple marrow aspirates and biopsies were done, the differential between HD involving the marrow and myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrates was made. The absence of diagnostic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells was useful in diagnosing the latter. All three patients died of causes related to cytopenias, with two having progressed to overt acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Myelofibrosis with lymphocytic infiltrates in the marrow, without diagnostic RS cells, in patients' status after treatment for HD, should alert one to the possibility of myelodysplasia.
