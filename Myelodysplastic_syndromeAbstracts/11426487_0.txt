A Phase II study of GM-CSF with intermediate-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was conducted in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. It was designed to evaluate if priming with growth factor could increase the efficiency of chemotherapy. In this older population only two of 10 patients achieved a bone marrow CR, including one patient whose leukemic blasts had an "S" phase increase of 2.55x at 48 hr. Unexpected hepatotoxicity was noted. This regimen cannot be recommended for this elderly population of patients.
