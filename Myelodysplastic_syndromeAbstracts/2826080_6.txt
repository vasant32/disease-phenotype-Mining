Sixty cats with hematologic abnormalities indicative of non-lymphoid hematopoietic neoplasia were classified into two groups, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), using criteria developed for human patients with similar diseases. Cats with myeloblast counts in bone marrow of less than 30% were classed as MDS and cats with myeloblast counts of 30% or greater were classed as AML. The clinical, laboratory, and postmortem findings in each group were described and compared. Clinical signs of disease were similar in both groups, the most common being inappetance, lethargy, and weakness. Non-regenerative anemia, macrocytosis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were frequent hemogram abnormalities in both groups. Diagnostically useful differences in physical and peripheral blood findings were a higher prevalence of splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and severe anemia in the AML group. Circulating myeloblasts were found only in cats in the AML group. Outcome of disease was similar in both groups; 85% of the cats in each group died or were euthanatized within one week of diagnosis. In cats that were necropsied, extramedullary leukemic infiltrates were found in all cats in the AML group and in none of the cats in the MDS group.
