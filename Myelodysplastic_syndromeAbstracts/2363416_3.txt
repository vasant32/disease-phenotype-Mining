Sarcoidosis has been observed in association with numerous blood dyscrasias including lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma. This report describes a patient with sarcoidosis and a refractory anemia whose bone marrow karyotype showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, consistent with a myelodysplastic syndrome. Concurrent sarcoidosis and myelodysplasia may relate to the continued availability of cytokines as a consequence of repeated macrophage, T-cell, and B-cell interactions, with evolution to the 5q- abnormality. This association may merit specific attention in the future approach to the diagnostic evaluation in certain patients with sarcoidosis.
