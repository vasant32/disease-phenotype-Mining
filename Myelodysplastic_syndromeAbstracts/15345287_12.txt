 OBJECTIVES: Ras oncogene mutations are the most frequently observed genetic abnormality (20-40% of patients) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and in the preleukemic conditions myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). We have previously shown that mutant N-ras (N-rasm) can induce myeloproliferative disorders and apoptosis in a murine reconstitution system. In the present study we investigated the effect of N-rasm in human primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). METHODS: Cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) were transduced with retroviral vectors containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone, or in combination with N-rasm. Cells were then cultured in vitro with a cytokine supplement or cocultured with murine stroma MS-5 cells. The in vivo behavior of transduced cells was examined in the NOD/SCID mouse model. RESULTS: N-rasm-transduced cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity; a higher frequency of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM); and an increase in myelomonocytic lineage cells with a concomitant decrease in lymphoid and erythroid cells. Analysis of transduced HPC in NOD/SCID mice revealed higher bone marrow engraftment by N-rasm HPC and increased numbers of myeloid lineage cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that N-rasm in HPC induces myeloproliferation both in vitro and in the NOD/SCID mouse model as a primary event that does not appear to be dependent on cooperating transforming events.
