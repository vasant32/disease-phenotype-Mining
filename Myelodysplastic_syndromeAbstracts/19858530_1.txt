Platelet transfusions have the highest incidence of post-transfusion sepsis compared with any other blood products. Recent reports suggest that platelet-related bacteraemia occurs at a frequency of approximately 50 times greater than that for red blood cells. The source is usually skin contaminants from the donor and several organisms have been implicated, the commonest of which are coagulase-negative staphylococci. This report describes a case of serious Staphylococcus aureus sepsis following platelet transfusion, and discusses relevant methods to detect and prevent bacterial contamination of blood products.
