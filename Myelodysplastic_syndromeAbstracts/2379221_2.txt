Two patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and malignant tumours are reported. The first patient developed myelogenous leukaemia soon after the myelodysplastic syndrome has been diagnosed. The undifferentiated gastric lymphoma found in the second patient suggests that an increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancies in CVID could partly be due to lymphomas. We hypothesize that the tissue- or site-specific risk of lymphomas and gastrointestinal cancer can be explained by an increased chromosomal or genomic instability with a higher mutation rate and genomic disorganization, and that this instability could be related to viral carcinogenesis. The primary immunodeficiency per se may not be responsible for the cancer susceptibility in CVID patients.
