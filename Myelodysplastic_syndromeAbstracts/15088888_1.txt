 BACKGROUND: The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of stem cell disorders characterized by a reduction in one or more elements of the peripheral blood. Oral manifestations of the disease and oral complications of medical management may result in significant symptoms and have an impact on the systemic condition of the patient. The removal of the infectious focus, such active teeth infection or severe periodontal disease, remains controversial in these patients, due to the increased risk of bleeding and systemic infection. METHODS: This paper reports a case of MDS with spontaneous gingival hemorrhage and generalized gingival hyperplasia associated with periodontal disease. This patient underwent several platelet transfusions due to these oral complications. The patient received periodontal therapy, resulting in an improvement of the oral clinical situation and a decrease of gingival hyperplasia. RESULTS: The patient did not present any episode of gingival hemorrhage after the periodontal treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that periodontal therapy should be performed in MDS patients presenting thrombocytopenia, gingival hyperplasia, and gingival bleeding, with the intent of preventing further hemorrhagic episodes and possible systemic infection.
