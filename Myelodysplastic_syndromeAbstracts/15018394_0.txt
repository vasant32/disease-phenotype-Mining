Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of hematological diseases deriving from a clonally expanded precursor bone marrow cell. MDS are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias of various degrees and increased risk for transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. The incidence is highest in elderly people. Diagnosis is based on morphology, exclusion of reactive causes of dyshematopoiesis and cytogenetics/FISH. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the only curative therapy so far, is not feasible for most of the patients. Other therapeutic options include supportive therapy such as blood transfusions and antibiotics, hematopoietic growth factors (rHuEPO, G-CSF), immunomodulating agents and chemotherapy. It is important to install iron chelation therapy in cases with long term transfusion dependency.
