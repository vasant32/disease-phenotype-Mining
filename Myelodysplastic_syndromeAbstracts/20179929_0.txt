The prognostic value of karyotype in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is generally appreciated. However, the factors that are predictive of prognosis of patients with abnormal karyotypes are not known. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and World Health Organization classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) in 164 adult MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes. We also analyzed the prognostic relevance of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in these patients. We found that both IPSS and WPSS had strong prognostic value in patients with abnormal karyotypes (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Furthermore, we observed the significant differences in the survival of patients with abnormal karyotypes based on MCV stratification: The median survival of patients with macrocytosis was 31.0 months, significantly longer than the 16.5-month median survival time of patients with MCVs of less than 100 fl (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that lower level of hemoglobin (P = 0.012, HR = 6.83), higher level of marrow blasts (P < 0.001, HR = 1.93), complex karyotype (P = 0.001, HR = 3.32), and MCV of less than 100 fl (P = 0.026, HR = 1.75) were independent risk factors that affected the survival of patients with abnormal karyotypes.
