PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of all patients who died of HIV infection within 10 years (1. 1. 1988 to 31. 12. 1997) at the Klinikum NÃ¼rnberg 58 autopsy cases were reviewed at the Institute of Pathology of the above mentioned hospital. RESULTS: The male:female ratio was 2.1:1, the mean age being 40.5 years. Most of the patients showed an advanced stage of lymphadenopathy at the moment of death. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, both HIV-related malignant diseases, were diagnosed in 6/58 cases, 10.3% each. HIV-related myelodysplastic changes existed in 28/58 patients (48.3%). Twelve patients showed an HIV-associated encephalopathy (20.7%). Opportunistic infections (pneumocystis carinii, cytomegaly, toxoplasmosis, atypical mycobacteriosis) were found in 28/58 patients (48.3%). A mycosis was diagnosed in 9/58 cases (15.5%). Tuberculosis was identified in 4/58 patients (6.9%). Cirrhosis of the liver was ascertained in 8/58 patients (13.8%). 24/58 patients (41.4%) died of respiratory disorder. CONCLUSION: In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome numerous morphological findings will be helpful in diagnosis and therapy.
