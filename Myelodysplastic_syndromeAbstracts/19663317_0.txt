We carried out the cytogenetic investigation of bone marrow aspirate from 32 patients with different types of MDS. The patients were from 8 regions of Ukraine. 11 patients had abnormal karyotype, and the transformation to AML were observed in 5 of them (45.5%). 27% of all patients had chromosomal changes with 3 or more chromosomes involved. The highest percentage of the patients with chromosomal anomalies (66.7%) was in cases of RAEB. Chromosome deletions were the most frequently detected karyotype abnormalities. We consider the phenomenon of chromosome fragmentation as the cytogenetic approval of the increased level of apoptosis in patients with MDS. The risk of the transformation to AML was measured using new international score system IPSS.
