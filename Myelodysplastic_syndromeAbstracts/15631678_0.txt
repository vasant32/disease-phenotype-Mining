The study was aimed to explore clinical result of cyclosporin A (CsA) and androgens for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with refractory anemia. Four cases of MDS-RA were treated with CsA and androgens, while the changes of blood counts, bone marrow and chromosome were observed. The results showed that substantial hematological response was observed in all four patients, that their anemia improved and all transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. In conclusion, CsA and Adr therapy was well tolerated. CsA and Adr therapy offer an alternative treatment of MDS with RA. The mechanisms of the benifical effect from this therapy remain the subject of an ongoing study.
