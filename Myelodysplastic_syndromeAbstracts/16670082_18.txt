The JAK2/V617F mutation has been noted in essential thrombocytemia. We investigated 19 cases with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), including three RARS with thrombocytosis (RARS-T). Only the RARS-T patients showed this mutation. More cases need to be analyzed to determine the prevalence of the JAK2/V617F mutation in RARS-T.
