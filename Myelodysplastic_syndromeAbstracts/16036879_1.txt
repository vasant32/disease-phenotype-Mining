Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is still a very useful adjunct for hematological diagnosis in the era of molecular techniques. In this article, the main applications of TEM to the cellular identification of normal myeloid cells, the study of dyserythropoietic conditions, myelodysplastic syndromes, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, acute myeloid leukemias, and lymphoproliferative disorders, as well as the application of ultrastructural cytochemical reactions in hematological diagnosis, are reviewed.
