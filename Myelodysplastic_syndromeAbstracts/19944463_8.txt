We report on a retrospective analysis examining the influence of pre-transplant serum ferritin on transplant outcomes of 99 MDS patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT. The median pre-transplant ferritin value was 1992 ng/ml (range: 6-9580 ng/ml). No patients received iron chelation therapy preceding transplantation. On univariate analysis, there was a strong correlation between a higher pre-transplant serum ferritin (>1500 ng/ml) and a significantly inferior 3-year OS (64.6+/-7.5% vs 39.6+/-7.3%, p=0.01). However, pre-transplant serum ferritin did not influence 3-year TRM (20.2+/-7% vs 27.4+/-7%, p=0.24). There was no difference in infection-related mortality, and incidence of acute or chronic GvHD between cohorts. On multivariate analysis, a raised serum ferritin (HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 0.97-3.57, p=0.03), and the presence of >5% bone marrow blasts at time of transplantation (HR: 2.14, 95% CI: 0.84-4.58, p=0.06) were independent predictors of an inferior overall survival. However, pre-transplant serum ferritin was not a significant predictor of disease-free survival, relapse or TRM. When compared with myeloablative regimens, RIC regimens may attenuate the impact of iron overload related end-organ toxicity. Prospective studies incorporating alternative biomarkers of iron metabolism alongside serum ferritin levels are needed to improve our understanding of the significance of iron overload in MDS patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation.
