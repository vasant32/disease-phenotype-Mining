Patterns of erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis were studied in 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and in one with smouldering leukaemia by correlating CFU-C, BFU-E and CFU-E cloning efficiency with erythroid and myeloid maturation indices derived from quantitative 14C-autoradiography and with ferrokinetics. Maturation index of a cell lineage was defined as the ratio of cell production rate increase from the first to the last proliferative compartment over the corresponding normal value. The myeloid maturation index was reduced in all cases, but CFU-C progenitor frequency was increased by a factor of 3. Erythroid maturation index was also reduced in most cases, and BFU-E progenitor frequency was reduced by a factor of 2. Similarly, CFU-E cloning efficiency corrected for the erythroid maturation index was 2.5-10-fold lower than normal. Comparison of the erythroid maturation index with ferrokinetics revealed a constant ratio of ineffective erythropoiesis with a maturation disturbance in the proliferative pool twice that in the non-proliferative pool. These findings indicate basic qualitative and quantitative abnormalities and a difference in the patterns of production of erythroid and myeloid cells in the myelodysplastic syndromes: Myeloid progenitors are increased in number but their maturation is grossly abnormal. On the other hand, the apparent reduction in erythroid progenitors and the reduced erythroid maturation index are attributable to both premature cell death of the more mature erythroblasts and an increased proerythroblast proliferation, i.e. extra divisions in the proerythroblast compartment at the expense of maturation.
