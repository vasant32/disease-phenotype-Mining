Higher-risk MDS with del5q carry a poor prognosis. In this phase 2 trial, 47 patients with higher-risk MDS received lenalidomide 10 mg/day. International Prognostic Scoring System was high in 60%, intermediate-2 risk in 40%. del 5q was isolated, with one additional and more than one additional abnormality in 19%, 23%, and 58% patients, respectively. Thirteen (27%) patients achieved hematologic response, including 7 hematologic complete remission (CR) (with complete [4] or partial [3] cytogenetic response), 2 marrow CR and 4 hematologic improvement erythroid, and 12 became red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independent, for a median duration of 6.5 months. Median CR duration was 11.5 months. Six of 9 (67%) patients with isolated del 5q achieved CR, versus 1 of 11 and none of 27 patients with one or more than one additional abnormality, respectively (P < .001). Seven of 20 (35%) with initial platelets more than 100,000/mm(3) obtained CR, compared with none of the 27 with lower platelet counts less than 100,000/mm(3) (P = .001). Our data support a potential role of lenalidomide in higher-risk MDS with isolated del 5q.
