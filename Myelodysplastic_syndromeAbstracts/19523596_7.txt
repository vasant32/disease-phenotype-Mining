 PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the best tool to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement is an evidence-based approach to improve the quality of RCTs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of published RCTs concerning myeloid hematologic malignancies according to the CONSORT statement. METHODS: PubMed was searched for English-language RCTs involving patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Trials were considered eligible when participants were randomly assigned to at least two treatment arms and included patients with AML, CML or MDS. Quality of reporting was assessed using a 24-item questionnaire based on the CONSORT checklist. Reporting was assessed in one pre-CONSORT (1988-1995) and one post-CONSORT (1996-2008) period. The effect of CONSORT statement in high- and low-ranked journals, according to their impact factor, has also been evaluated. RESULTS: The search identified 261 eligible articles for analysis. Only 13 of the 24 items of CONSORT statement were addressed in 75% or more of the studies. Most items concerning the methodological issues were reported by fewer than 50% of the studies. Significant improvements over time were seen for items that assessed the methodological quality, while RCTs published in high-ranked journals showed better quality of reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of reporting in RCTs focusing on myeloid malignancies remains unsatisfactory. Further improvement of reporting is necessary to assess the validity of clinical research.
