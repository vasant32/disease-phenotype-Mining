We have tested granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (rhGM-CSF, fully glycosylated, Sandoz, Schering/Plough) in 40 patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The drug enhanced leukocyte recovery in 5 different dose levels (2-32 micrograms/kg body weight) if given by continuous intravenous infusion or subcutaneously for 5 days. Patients who received rhGM-CSF during neutropenic infections (n = 32) survived significantly better if they recovered leukocytes to at least 1.5 x 10(9)/l. In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and excess of blasts (n = 82) remission could be induced in nearly 50% if the drug was given together with low dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-AraC). The results of these phase-II-studies show that rhGM-CSF is a safe drug which may save many patients from life-threatening situations during haematopoietic insufficiency.
