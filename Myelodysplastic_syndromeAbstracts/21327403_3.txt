To better understand the detection and management of iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a 15-min web- or paper-based survey was conducted among 338 European physicians from 27 countries. Respondents had a mean of 18 years of clinical experience. Forty-six percent and 27% of physicians noted that detecting and treating iron overload were either "very important" or "important," respectively. The main reason for not actively exploring iron overload was related to poor patient prognosis, while the main reasons for not initiating iron chelation therapy were poor patient prognosis and older patient age. Thirty-seven percent and 31% of physicians believed that treating iron overload in these patients was "very important" or "important," respectively. Ninety percent of physicians prescribed iron chelation therapy, and 38% of transfusion-dependent patients received iron chelation therapy. The key reasons for not initiating iron chelation therapy were related to poor patient prognosis (72%), patient age â‰¥85 years (50%), and comorbidities (34%). The views of these experienced MDS physicians reflect available international MDS treatment guidelines.
