Fifty percent of patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome, frequently following treatment by radiation or chemotherapy, have prognostically unfavorable deletions of the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 7, or trisomy 8, as have the 25% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia where remissions last 6-12 months, and where relapse cannot be prevented. In contrast, patients with prognostically favorable cytogenetics (translocation 15; 17 or 8; 21 or inversion 16) maintenance chemotherapy may prevent relapses. Of chronic myelocytic leukemia patients, 85% can achieve hematological remission with interferon alpha, and 40% a partial cytogenetic remission, which probably delays relapse.
