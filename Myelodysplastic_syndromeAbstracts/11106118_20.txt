BACKGROUND: The topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have been shown to induce therapy-related AML (t-AML) characterized by a short latency period after chemotherapy, the absence of prior myelodysplastic syndrome and stereotyped chromosome aberrations. Few reports have been published on patients treated with the anthracenedione mitoxantrone which also targets topoisomerase II. We observed 10 cases of such t-AML over a 7-year-period in breast cancer patients treated with mitoxantrone combined with fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and regional radiotherapy, and in three cases with vindesine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients referred to our hospital for AML with a past history of polychemotherapy for breast cancer, including mitoxantrone, either as adjuvant (8 patients)/neoadjuvant (1 patient) therapy or for metastatic disease (1 patient). We studied the probability of developing t-AML in a prospective series of 350 patients treated with an adjuvant FNC regimen (mitoxantrone, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide) and radiation therapy. RESULTS: The median age was 45 years (range 35-67). t-AML developed 13-36 months (median 16) after beginning chemotherapy for breast cancer, and 4-28 months (median 10.5) after ending treatment. As described in t-AML following treatment with epipodophyllotoxins or anthracyclines, we found a majority of FAB M4, M5 and M3 phenotypes (7 of 10), and characteristic karyotype abnormalities that also can be found in de novo AML: breakpoint on chromosome 11q23 (3 patients), inv(16)(p13q22) (2 patients), t(15;17)(q22;q11) (1 patient), t(8;21)(q22;q22) (1 patient) and del(20q)(q11) (1 patient). The prognosis was poor. All patients died of AML shortly after diagnosis. Since two patients had been enrolled in a prospective trial for the treatment of breast cancer which included 350 patients, the probability of developing t-AML was calculated to be 0.7% from 25-40 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method (95%, confidence interval (95% CI): 0.1-4.5). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mitoxantrone with cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy can induce t-AML, as with other topoisomerase II-targeted drugs. Despite a low incidence, the prognosis appears to be poor.
