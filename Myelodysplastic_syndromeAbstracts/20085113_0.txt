Specialty Pharmacy plays an integral role in the delivery and management of biologic and chemotherapeutic medications for patients with higher-risk MDS by streamlining the delivery process, educating patients, monitoring treatment adherence and response, managing complex storage and delivery requirements, and assisting both patients and payers with clinical, operational, and financial issues and challenges. Specialty Pharmacy will continue to develop procedures to assist clinicians and patients, maximizing access to pharmacy and clinical advisors who are able to explain medical diagnoses to patients, walk them through medication options, and describe the specific details of therapeutic regimens. Where the use of specialty pharmaceuticals poses challenges of inventory, sourcing, complex treatment regimens, patient adherence, and slow reimbursement, Specialty Pharmacy has designed standardized processes to address these needs and will continue to improve and increases its services to support vital business and clinical functions for patients, health care plans, and providers.
