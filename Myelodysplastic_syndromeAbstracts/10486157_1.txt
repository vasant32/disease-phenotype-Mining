Histological, enzyme histochemical and ultrastructural findings in three cases of feline bone marrow neoplasia are described. The following changes were observed: in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a low medullary blast count, strongly atypical (micromegakaryocytic) proliferative megakaryocytopoiesis, hypoplastic erythrocytopoiesis with impairment of differentiation, multifocal extravasation and lymphoid aggregates; in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), medullary proliferation of undifferentiated cell types; in chronic myeloIproliferative disorder (CMPD), trilinear medullary proliferation with complete cellular maturation, osteomyelosclerosis and extramedullary haemopoiesis. In two cases (MDS, AML), ultrastructural demonstration of C-type virus particles (feline leukaemia virus) suggested a viral aetiology.
