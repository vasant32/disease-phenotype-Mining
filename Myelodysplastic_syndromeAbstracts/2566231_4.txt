A 72-year-old immunocompromised man with myelodysplastic syndrome who developed multiple erythematous, scaly abscesses like lesions on his left foot and lower leg is described. He also had dry scaly lesions on his soles and lesions on several toe nails. A punch biopsy showed abscesses with fungal elements and Trichophyton rubrum was cultured from skin scales and the biopsy. A diagnosis of T. rubrum abscesses should be suspected in all immunocompromised patients with signs of superficial dermatophyte infection.
