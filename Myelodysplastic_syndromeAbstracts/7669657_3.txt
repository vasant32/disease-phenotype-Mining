Macrocytosis in the elderly is often caused by abnormalities of haematological stem cell differentiation. In this study, a group of elderly patients was analysed for four molecular and cell biological parameters. The aim of the study was to screen elderly patients with idiopathic macrocytic anaemia or MDS for a set of alterations which are related to haematological dysplasia. The analyses used were: DNA-methylation at the calcitonin A gene 5'-area, NRAS point mutations at codons 12 and 13, in vitro colony formation of peripheral blood progenitor cells and cytogenetics of bone marrow cells. The results show that a significant portion of elderly patients with idiopathic macrocytosis have one or more of the abnormalities analysed. Hypermethylation of the calcitonin A gene 5'-area at the chromosome 11 band p15 is relatively common (7/15). Chromosomal aberrations (3/12) and NRAS oncogene point mutations (0/15) were rare findings. In vitro culture of erythroid progenitor cells was relatively frequently abnormal (7/15). Eight of our nine macrocytic patients who did not fulfill the FAB criteria for MDS had at least one of the alterations studied; this suggests that these patients might represent early phases of a stem cell disorder.
