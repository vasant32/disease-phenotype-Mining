To investigate the role of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) in the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), marrow progenitor cells from 18 MDS patients were highly purified using CD34 monoclonal antibody and immunomagnetic microspheres (MDS CD34+ cells). These cells were cultured in serum-free medium with various combinations of five colony stimulating factors (CSFs): recombinant human interleukin-3 (rIL-3), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), macrophage-CSF (rM-CSF), and erythropoietin (rEP). Among the tested CSFs, such as rM-CSF, rG-CSF, rGM-CSF and rIL-3, a combination of the first three CSFs was the most effective stimulus for the proliferation of non-erythroid MDS progenitor cells. An increase of undifferentiated "blast" cell colonies in 5/18 MDS patients occurred and these 5 patients belonged to the high-risk group. In the presence of these three CSFs, rIL-3 had no effect on the proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34+ cells; however, IL-3 was efficient for the proliferation of MDS CD34+ cells to the erythroid lineage. rGM-CSF or rIL-3 alone did not efficiently support proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ cells. M-CSF is present in normal human serum at a concentration of 550 +/- 110 U/ml, a concentration exceeding that used in this study (100 U/ml). Therefore, in vivo administration of G-CSF combined with GM-CSF to MDS patients may be one of the most effective CSF combinations for proliferation of MDS progenitor cells to the non-erythroid lineage. However, the effect on the capacity for differentiation was minimal, especially in patients belonging to the high-risk group.
