Monosomy or deletion of chromosome 7 is a frequent finding in both de novo and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Based on analysis of deletions of chromosome 7 in such patients, it has been suggested that there is a critical region of the chromosome lying within bands q21-q31. We have examined bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with MDS, AML and biphenotypic acute leukaemia who had monosomy for or rearrangement of chromosome 7, seeking evidence of non-random allele loss that might suggest the presence of imprinted genes on the chromosome. Bone marrow cells from one patient with the infant monosomy 7 syndrome had loss of maternal alleles as did two patients with biphenotypic leukaemia. Five out of five patients with MDS and both patients with de novo AML had loss of paternal alleles. One of the latter patients had a del(7) (q31q36) rather than monosomy 7. These findings suggest that imprinting of a gene(s) on chromosome 7, within the bands q31-q36, may be of importance in MDS and AML. Despite the reported increased incidence of AML amongst relatives of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) the gene for which lies in chromosome region 7q31, none of the patients nor parents studied here appeared to be carriers of the most common gene mutation seen in patients with CF, the delta F508.
