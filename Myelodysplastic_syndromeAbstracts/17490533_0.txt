The study was aimed to investigate the value of activated plasma clotting time (APCT) for estimating the efficacy of platelet transfusion therapy. There were twenty patients with hematological diseases, who received transfusion of platelet, involved in the test. APCT was determined before and after transfusion of these patients, then APCT was contrasted with corresponding CCI and PPR. The results showed that 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened obviously. APCT before transfusion was (103.7 +/- 11.3) seconds, but the 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened to (60.0 +/- 9.7) seconds and (68.5 +/- 9.8) seconds respectively (P < 0.01). According to the judging criteria of CCI and PPR (CCI and PPR values at 1 and 24 hours after transfusion are < 7500, < 5000 and < 30%, < 20% respectively, the transfusion is invalid), two patients received invalid transfusion. Their 1 and 24 hour CCIs were 7415, 2966 and 6913, 4988 respectively. Their 1 and 24 hour PPRs were 28.0%, 11.2% and 25.2%, 14.1% respectively. One patient's PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but his CCI showed a valid transfusion he received. Two patients' PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but their 1 hour CCI reached the standard of valid transfusion, and their 24 hour CCI reached the standard of invalid transfusion. It is concluded that APCT reflects the variations of quantity and quality of platelet simultaneously, and can evaluate precisely the efficacy of platelet transfusion.
