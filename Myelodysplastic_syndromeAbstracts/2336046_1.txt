Serum ferritin concentration was studied in 79 patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), 14 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), eleven patients with osteomyelosclerosis (OMS) and four patients with megakaryocytic myelosis (MM). Pretreatment serum ferritin concentrations were found to be normal or slightly decreased in patients with PV, OMS, MM and in the chronic phase of CGL. Patients entering the blastic crisis of CGL had highly increased serum ferritin concentrations. The severity of hyperferritinemia in these patients depended on the cytomorphological type of the blastic crisis. Highest levels of serum ferritin concentration were found in the immature myeloblastic type according to the M1- and M2-type of the FAB-classification of acute leukemias (i.e. 30-fold and 18-fold increased). In contrast, the rise of the serum ferritin concentration in the more mature types of blastic crisis was less pronounced (i.e. nine-fold in the M3-type and six-fold in the M4- and M5-type of blastic crisis). Patients with complete remission after bone marrow transplantation had normal serum ferritin concentrations. Investigation of the intracellular ferritin concentration showed, that the serum ferritin levels paralleled the intracellular ferritin concentration within the leukemic blasts: During the myeloic blastic crisis the intracellular ferritin concentration was found to be 17-fold increased compared to the intracellular ferritin concentrations in the chronic phase of CGL. Thus, our data support the concept that an increased synthesis of ferritin by the leukemic blasts is responsible for the increased serum ferritin concentration during the blastic crisis of CGL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
