OBJECTIVE: A report of a group of patients with pancytopenia which might be related to abnormal immunity. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory features of 29 patients with positive bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) Coombs tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Most of these cases were pancytopenia with normal or decreased bone marrow cellularities and increased normoblasts. They were all found to have negative results of conventional hemolysis tests and hematopoietic nutrient determination and had no evidence of malignant clonal hematopoiesis. However, all of them showed positive BMMNC-Coombs test and good response to corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Immunorelated pancytopenia might be caused by abnormal immunity (especially autoantibody) mediated destruction or abnormal function of blood cells. It is beneficial to differentiate immunorelated pancytopenia from aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.
