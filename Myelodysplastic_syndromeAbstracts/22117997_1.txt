Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and serum ferritin levels are both considered to be important biological factors in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study evaluated the levels of ROS in 40 patients with MDS (19 males and 21 females) using the Free Radical Analytical  System, FRAS4, and derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolite kits. The patients' mean age was 67.3 years (range 58 - 86 years). The sera of 34 (85%) patients exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress than the reference range. There was a positive correlation between ROS levels and  serum ferritin levels, and a negative correlation between ROS levels and haemoglobin levels. There was a negative relationship between serum haemoglobin and ferritin levels. The results indicated that iron accumulation or severe anaemia could contribute to oxidative stress in MDS patients.  Iron chelation and antioxidant therapy may be suitable for the management of MDS.
