To explore the relationship between T cell markers in hematological diseases and T cell markers in solid tumor, CD3, CD4, CD8 in hematological diseases, malignant and benign tumors were detected by flow cytometry and results were analyzed statistically. The results showed that CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD4/CD8 in chronic leukemia decreased significantly while these markers in acute leukemia and MDS decreased obviously in comparison with normal persons and other hematological diseases (P < 0.0l). Hemolytic anemia markers increased significantly (P < 0.05). CD3, CD4, CD4/CD8 in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura decreased and CD8 increased (P < 0.0l). CD3, CD4, CD8 in iron-deficiency anemia, anemia from chronic diseases, benign tumor and other hematological diseases were lower than those in normal persons and hemolytic anemia, but higher than those in acute and chronic leukemia, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia, and MDS (P > 0.05). It is notable that the above markers correlated with the development and prognosis of diseases. In conclusion, expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 contributes to diagnosis of hematological diseases and benign or malignant tumors, and is an important indicator for therapeutic strategy.
