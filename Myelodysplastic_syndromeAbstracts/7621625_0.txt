This report defines four levels of care required for the management of adult patients with haematological malignancies and marrow failure (acute and chronic leukaemias, lymphomas, myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders, myeloma and severe aplastic anaemia). The higher levels of care require increasing specialist expertise, staffing and resources. Staffing includes both the medical, nursing and scientific/laboratory professions and other support staff. Resources include ward provision, bed numbers, equipment, laboratory and radiotherapy facilities, pharmacy, support services and research. Blood transfusion services and their organisation are discussed separately. The guidelines indicate to providers and purchasers the issues to be considered in placing contracts for the care of these patients. A glossary of terms is provided for purchasers.
