The study was purposed to investigate the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the differentiation of human MDS cell lines SKM-1 induced by sodium butyrate (NaB), and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of differentiation in SKM-1 cells induced by NaB. The expression levels of total ERK and phosphorylated-ERK were determined by Western blot. The effect of NaB in combination with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 on the proliferation/differentiation of SKM-1 cells was studied, and then the expression levels of the P21 and HDAC protein were detected by Western blot. The results showed that the expression level of phosphorylated ERK was down-regulated by the 1 mmol/L NaB, and the level of total ERK had not changed. NaB or combination of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 with NaB could increase the differentiation of the SKM-1 cells and up-regulated the levels of the P21 and HDAC protein, but the effect of combination of NaB with PD98059 was higher than that of NaB alone. It is concluded that the inhibition of ERK may be involved in sodium butyrate inducing differentiation in SKM-1 cells.
