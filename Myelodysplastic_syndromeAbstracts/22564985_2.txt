MDS patients are prone to develop transfusional iron overload. Iron overload may partly explain why transfusion dependency is associated with a decreased likelihood of survival. Our matched-pair analysis included 94 patients on long-term chelation therapy and 94 matched patients without it. All patients had iron overload, defined as serum ferritin (SF) above 1000 ng/ml or a history of multiple transfusions and SF â‰¥ 500 ng/ml. Median SF was 1954 ng/ml in chelated and 875 ng/ml in non-chelated patients. The difference in median survival (74 vs. 49 months, respectively; p=0.002) supports the idea that iron chelation therapy is beneficial for MDS patients.
