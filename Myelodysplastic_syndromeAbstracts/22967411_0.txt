 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features and survival time in primary myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS) patients accompanied with immunological abnormalities. METHODS: The clinical information, laboratory findings and survival time in 194 untreated primary MDS patients with complete immunological laboratory tests or a past history of autoimmune disease were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 37/194 cases (19.07%) with autoimmune abnormalities, including 16/194 (8.25%) with autoimmune disease and 21/194 asymptomatic cases (10.82%) with serologic immunological abnormalities only. There was significant differences in the distribution of age < 60 years old, female, CD4(+)T-cell/CD8(+)T-cell ration < 1 and trisomy 8 (P < 0.05) between the cases with autoimmune disease and without autoimmune abnormalities. The former had a higher 2-year OS, but there was no significance (P = 0.065). There was no significant differences in the distribution of age, MDS-subtype, IPSS risk groups, haemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, platelets count, the severity of anemia and neutropenia, high level of serologic TNF, chromosomal abnormalities, cytogenetic risk groups and bone marrow cellularity (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: MDS patients with autoimmune disease are mainly female and yonger than 60 years old, with high proportion of trisomy 8 and better prognosis.
