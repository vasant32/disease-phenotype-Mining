 BACKGROUND: Transfusion-related morbidity is an emerging problem in chronically transfused patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although several iron-chelating drugs are available, the optimal way of treatment of iron-overload remains uncertain. A major disadvantage of deferoxamine is that the drug has to be applied as continuous subcutaneous infusion. Therefore, novel oral agents have been developed. One of these drugs is deferasirox (Exjade). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on 14 MDS patients who were treated with deferasirox (500-1500 mg daily) for up to 24 months. In these patients, treatment responses were recorded by determining serum ferritin levels before and during therapy and by applying recently established response criteria. RESULTS: In all patients except one, ferritin levels decreased during therapy. Four patients showed a complete response, one a minor response and five a stable iron load. In the responding patients, initially elevated liver enzymes decreased substantially. No substantial change in transferrin saturation or transfusion frequency was recorded. Side effects were mild and tolerable in most patients. In one patient, treatment with deferasirox was stopped because of impaired kidney function. CONCLUSION: Our data show that treatment with deferasirox is a reasonable approach to counteract iron overload in patients with MDS.
