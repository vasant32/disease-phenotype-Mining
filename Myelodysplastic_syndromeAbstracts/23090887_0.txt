We hypothesized that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic factor in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We analyzed records of 767 patients treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between January 2001 and December 2009 to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin (SA) at the time of presentation and overall survival (OS). Patients (median age of 69 years) were stratified into three groups based on SA concentration (≤3.5, 3.6-4.0, and >4.0 g/dL). Two-thirds of the patients had low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-based risk for MDS. Median OS by SA concentration of ≤3.5, 3.6-4.0, and >4.0 g/dL was 11, 23, and 34 months, respectively (P < 0.005), whereas rate of acute myeloid leukemia progression was highest in patients with low SA (≤3.5 g/dL). The SA level offered prognostic discrimination for outcomes within the lower and higher IPSS risk groups, as well as with the MD Anderson risk model. In multivariable analysis, SA was a significant independent co-variate for OS after adjustment for IPSS, age, serum ferritin, and transfusion dependence (hazard ratio = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-0.9; P = 0.004). Our findings indicate that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic biomarker that may serve as a surrogate representative of disease biology or comorbidities in patients with MDS.
