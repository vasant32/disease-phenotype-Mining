The effects of interleukin 12 (IL-12) on natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and on the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were examined in 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are well known to have immunologic defects, and in 11 normal subjects. The NK cell cytotoxicity of all of the normal subjects was augmented by incubation with IL-12 alone, and co-incubation with interleukin 2 (IL-2) further augmented it (type A response). The MDS patients showed varied responses to IL-12/IL-2. Seven patients showed the type A response, resulting in augmented NK cell cytotoxicity which was similar to that in the normal subjects. In five other patients the cytotoxicity was not increased by IL-12 alone, but the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 did augment the cytotoxicity (type B response). The augmented cytotoxicity in these type B patients was lower than that in the normal subjects. In the final three MDS patients the cytotoxicity was low and not affected by IL-12 and/or IL-2 (type C response). All patients with refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and patients with RAEB in transformation showed a type B or C response. Conversely, six of eight refractory anaemia patients showed a type A response. In MDS patients there was a positive correlation between the percentage of CD3- CD56+ cells in pre-incubated cells and the cytotoxicity of cells incubated with IL-12/IL-2. The combination of IL-12 and IL-2 augmented IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production by nonadherent mononuclear cells in a synergistic or cumulative manner, respectively, in most patients. These results suggest that IL-12, alone or with IL-2, may modulate these important immunologic functions in most MDS patients.
