OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate sequelae and complications after dental extractions and to analyze their impact on medical treatment in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute and chronic leukemia, and multiple myeloma during a 3-year period. STUDY DESIGN: The study population included 388 patients with hematologic malignancies. All medical and dental charts were reviewed in a retrospective fashion to identify patients who received dental extractions. Preexisting dental disease and intervention (extraction) were evaluated, and parameters such as days of hospitalization and survival rate were compared with those of the remainder population who did not receive dental extractions. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients, 69 underwent dental extractions and 9 had sequelae and complications after the intervention. The resulting complication rate of 13% was reported. Although some patients did experience delay of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant (BMT), or both, no significant difference was found in the number of days in the hospital for BMT and the survival rate for the patients with sequelae and complications (n = 9) and for the remainder population (n = 319) ( >.05). CONCLUSION: Dental extraction intervention provided in the prechemotherapy and pre-BMT time frame did not have a negative bearing on medical outcome.
