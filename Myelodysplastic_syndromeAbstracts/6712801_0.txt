We have studied bone marrow CFU-GM growth behaviour in 13 patients with Dysmyelopoietic Syndrome by means of the analytical scoring at two sequential times of aggregates. In this way we have distinguished aggregates according to their size, in clusters or colonies and grouped them according to their "in vitro" appearance time, transformation from cluster to colony, "in vitro" survival time and "in vitro" degeneration time. This statement of the study allow us to map CFU-GM subtypes in a percentage distribution related to the total growth of CFU-GM. Comparisons between absolute number of growth of different CFU-GM subtypes in DS vs Normal subjects show both significant and not significant differences, while comparisons between percentages of growth in DS vs Normal subjects did not show significant differences. With this work we suggest an outline for the study and the interpretation of CFU-GM growth patterns in the haematological disorders at risk of evolution in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
