A patient with M2-ANLL and a 46,XX,del(5)(q22q33), t(2;11)(p21;q24) karyotype is described. The diagnosis was made after a short period of myelodysplastic syndrome. After chemotherapy consisting of Daunorubicin and Arabinosylcytosine in continuous infusion, the patient reached a complete remission. The chromosome pattern described here has been observed in two other patients with refractory anemia and refractory anemia with excess of blasts, respectively. The breakpoints on the chromosomes 2, 5 and 11 allow us to hypothesize the involvement of N-myc, c-fms, GM-CSF and IL-3 genes.
