Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) have normal expression restricted in the testis and also inappropriate expression in various tumor types. Special and favorable characteristics of these genes, as being immunogenic and therefore having the potential to be used as tumor vaccine, have made them as one of the star attractions of the cancer research. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous hematological disorder with various reported changes in gene expression. To find new CTA genes in AML, we analyzed the expression pattern of four testis-specific genes AURKC, OIP5, PIWIL2 and TAF7L using real-time quantitative PCR in 51 AMLs and 6 myelodysplastic syndrome cases in comparison with 33 healthy controls. The expression of the studied genes, noticeably OIP5 and TAF7L, differed between studied groups in a gender-dependent manner. Upregulation of OIP5 was observed only in ~41 % of the female AML patients as compared to the healthy females. The remaining ~59 % of the male AML patients, when compared to the healthy males, displayed downregulation of TAF7L. This finding may affect many aspects of AML such as diagnosis, prognosis assessment and treatment choice.
