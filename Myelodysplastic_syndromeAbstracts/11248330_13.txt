Checkpoint genes code for a family of proteins which sense DNA damage in eukaryotic cells. They play an important role in the control of the cell cycle. The human CHK2 is a homolog of the yeast G(2) checkpoint kinases known as CDS1 and RAD53. The CHK2 may be a tumor suppressor gene because it was found to be mutated in some individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These cases had a normal, non-mutated p53 gene. We performed a mutational analysis of the CHK2 gene using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in 41 bone marrow samples from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 41 samples of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). We found a novel G to C transversion resulting in a change from Ala to Gly at codon 507 of CHK2 in one MDS sample, but normal cells from this individual did not have the abnormality. In addition, we demonstrated a previously described polymorphism at codon 84 (A to G at nucleotide 252) of exon 1 of CHK2 in three of 41 MDS and three of 41 AML patients. The presence of a CHK2 mutation in MDS highlights the importance of alterations of cell cycle checkpoint genes in this disease.
