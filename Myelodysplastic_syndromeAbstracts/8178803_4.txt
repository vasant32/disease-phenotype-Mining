A 31-year-old woman presented with fever and arthralgia. Despite treatment with antimicrobials and corticosteroids, her symptoms persisted. A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-refractory anemia (RA) was made by pancytopenia, dysplasia, and trisomy 8. Cultures of bone marrow, blood, and gastric juice showed Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI). She was treated with antimycobacterial drugs and recombinant human G-CSF/M-CSF and showed an initial response, but spike fever recurred and pancytopenia progressed. Hepatosplenomegaly and marked retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy were revealed, indicating further dissemination of MAI. Treatment with recombinant human GM-CSF and very-low-dose cytosine arabinoside, was started but was not effective. This case showed significant reduction in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, especially the CD4+ population, and low immunoglobulin levels. Immunodeficiency state associated with long-term steroid therapy and MDS seemed to contribute to the development of the disseminated infection with MAI.
