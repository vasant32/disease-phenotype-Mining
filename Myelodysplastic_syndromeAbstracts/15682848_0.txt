111In-chloride bone marrow scintigraphy (bone marrow scintigraphy) was performed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), tracer accumulation was classified into patterns, and the relationship between the accumulation patterns and prognostic factors was investigated to assess the usefulness of bone marrow scintigraphy. The subjects were 14 patients diagnosed with MDS. Accumulation of the bone marrow scintigraphy tracer was classified according to the degree of accumulation in the axial bone marrow and peripheral expansion. International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which are frequently used for prognostic evaluation of MDS, and conversion to leukemia were investigated in prognostic factors. We also investigated the relationship between enlargement of the liver and spleen and the prognostic factors. The accumulation patterns were as follows: pattern I, The normal accumulation pattern (2 cases); pattern II, the expanded accumulation pattern (6 cases); pattern III, low accumulation pattern (5 cases); and pattern IV, heterogeneous accumulation pattern (1 case). The relationships between the two prognostic factors and accumulation patterns were investigated, and the prognosis was found to be significantly poorer in the patients with the low accumulation pattern than the expanded accumulation pattern. Enlargement of the liver and spleen was not significantly correlated with the prognostic factors.
