Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are observed in 30-50% of primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Although the prognostic relevance of cytogenetics is generally appreciated, the prognostic value of cytogenetic evolution has rarely been evaluated. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed cytogenetic features at diagnosis and during follow-up in 85 patients with primary MDS. Cytogenetic evolution occurred in 18 of the 85 patients (21%), with chromosomes 8, 5, and 1 most often involved. Patients with higher levels of marrow blasts (P = 0.034), more advanced stages of World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes (44% vs. 16%, P = 0.035), and higher risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) subgroups (47% vs. 16%, P = 0.021) had higher incidences of developing cytogenetic evolution. Furthermore, the median survival of patients in the group with cytogenetic evolution was 25.8 months, compared with 45.4 months for patients in the group without cytogenetic evolution (P = 0.01). The same result was also found for time to progression: patients with cytogenetic evolution progressed more rapidly than those without cytogenetic evolution (P = 0.007). Knowledge of cytogenetic evolution offers useful information for clinicians to make more accurate prognostic assessments for patients with MDS.
