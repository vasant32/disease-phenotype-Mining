The Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, is a tumor marker for leukemic blast cells. The WT1 expression levels were examined for 57 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (refractory anemia (RA), 35; RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) 14; RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), six; and MDS with fibrosis, two) and 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolved from MDS. These levels significantly increased in proportion to the disease progression of MDS from RA to overt AML via RAEB and RAEB-t in both bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). WT1 expression levels in PB significantly correlated with the evolution of RAEB or RAEB-t to overt AML within 6 months. Therefore, WT1 expression levels in PB were superior to those in BM for early prediction of the evolution to AML by means of quantitation of the WT1 expression levels. Furthermore, WT1 expression in PB of patients with overt AML evolved from MDS was significantly decreased by effective chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation and became undetectable in long-term survivors. These results clearly showed that WT1 expression levels are a tumor marker for preleukemic or leukemic blast cells of MDS and thus reflect the disease progression of MDS. Therefore, monitoring of WT1 expression levels has made continuous assessment of the disease progression of MDS possible, as well as the prediction of the evolution of RAEB or RAEB-t to overt AML within 6 months. The results also showed that quantitation of WT1 expression levels is useful for diagnosis of minimal residual disease of MDS with high sensitivity, thus making it possible to evaluate the efficacy of treatment for MDS.
