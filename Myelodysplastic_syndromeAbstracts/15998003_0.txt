Pneumoconiosis is the most common occupational disease of the respiratory system. The aim of this paper is presentation of case of pneumoconiosis coexisting with myelodysplastic syndrome in a former coal miner occupationally exposed to coal dust. In a mineral coal miner, aged 56 year, with a 15-year duration of work underneath, suffering from pneumoconiosis, pancytopenia was detected. He was admitted to the hospital, where myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed. The patient's condition was gradually worsening, even though chemotherapy was applied, he died from thrombocytopenia manifested by bleeding from the digestive tract in a relatively short time since diagnosis. The presented case seems to be interesting not only in view of possible development of pneumoconiosis as a result of occupational exposure to coal dust, typical in this case, but also in view of the occurrence of clonal disease of blood several years after cessation of exposure.
