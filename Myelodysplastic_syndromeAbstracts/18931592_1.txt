Platinum is the key drug in current treatment of ovarian cancer. The overall survival rate of patients with advanced ovarian cancer has improved. Recently, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome(T-MDS)and therapy-related leukemia( TRL)have been reported with increasing frequency in the literature. In this paper, we report two cases of TMDS followed by TRL after chemotherapy(TC therapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel)with ovarian cancer stageIIIc. The interval from the primary chemotherapy to TMDS was 23 months or 90 months. The abnormal karyotype was observed in chromosomal analysis. Neither cases were given chemotherapy for TMDS, and died of the immunodeficiency. TRL and T-MDS are the most serious complications of chemotherapy. If pancytopenia is detected, bone marrow and cytogenetic examinations should be performed to rule out TMDS.
