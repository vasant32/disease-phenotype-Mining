 AIM: To explore the effect of IL-15 on proliferation and differentiation of CD34 (+) cells from MDS patients. METHODS: The CD34 (+) cells were separated by magnetic bead-activated cell sorter (MACS) system, and cultured in fluid or methylcellulose semisolid medium. MTT colorimetry was used to examine the inhibitory effect of IL-15 on the proliferation of MDS CD34(+) cells.The numbers of CD34(+)cells and colony formation of CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-G, CFU-GEMM were counted. The expressions of CD33, CD13, CD71, CD19 and CD3 on cultured cells and the change of cell-cycle were analyzed by FCM. RESULTS: The recovery rate of CD34(+) cells was (75.4+/-5.2) %, the purity of CD34 (+) cells in positive fraction was (90.3+/-6.3) % and the enriched rate was (83.1+/-12.5) % in 11 MDS patients. MTT colorimetry detection showed that IL-15 could promote the proliferation of MDS CD34(+) cells. The optimal time of promotoing CD34(+) cell proliferation by IL-15 was 8 days and optimal dosage of IL-15 was 20 microg/L. After culture for 8 days with 0 microg/L IL-15 (control group) and 20 microg/L IL-15(experimental group), the number of CD34 (+) cells increased by 4.6-fold in control group and 6.3-fold in experimental group (P<0.05, n=5). The colony formation rates of experimental group were significantly higher than those of control group. The expression rates of the CD molecules (except for CD3) on CD34(+) in experimental group were notably higher than those in control group. As compared with control group, much more CD34(+) cells of experimental group were in G(2) and S phase of cell cycle(P<0.05, n=7). CONCLUSION: IL-15 can obviously promote the proliferation and differentiation of CD34(+) cells from MDS patients.
