 BACKGROUND: Thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis and exerts complex immunomodulatory activities. This phase II study aimed to examine the efficacy of thalidomide in Taiwanese patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients [intention to treat group (ITT)] with MDS were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/day, increased by 100 mg/day weekly to a maximum of 400 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Forty-two patients of the ITT group were considered as comprising the evaluable population (EP). RESULTS: Thalidomide resulted in hematological improvement (HI) in 28% of ITT analysis and in HI in 40% of the EP. Thalidomide was more effective for MDS patients with low to intermediate-1 International Prognostic Score System scores. The response rates were 7% for ITT and 10% for EP patients. Only two patients exhibited a cytogenetic response. Net reduced levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor cytokines were observed in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of thalidomide-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Low-dose thalidomide is an effective and safe treatment for patients with low-risk MDS.
