Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) is a reactive skin process frequently associated with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases, but particularly with hematologic malignancies. It usually precedes the underlying disorders for months or even years. Much of the evidence for this is based on a small series of case reports and reviews of the literature. Recently, immunological theories have suggested that helper T cell type 1 is involved in the pathogenesis of Sweet's syndrome. This process causes stimulation of the cytokine cascade, which may be responsible for the local and systemic activation of neutrophils and histiocytes. Clinically, Sweet's syndrome is characterized by an acute eruption of painful erythematous or violaceous plaques or nodules with fever, malaise, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Peripheral blood neutrophilia is frequent and is one of the diagnostic criteria. However, 53% of patients with Sweet's syndrome linked to hematologic malignancies do not present any neutrophilia but rather granulocytopenia. Abnormal functioning of neutrophils is possible in many diseases. We report a case of a middle-aged male patient presenting Sweet's syndrome and granulocytopenia due to myelodysplasia and an anomalous chromosome seven (7-) with poor prognosis.
