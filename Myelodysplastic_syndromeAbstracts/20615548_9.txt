We report the first prospective study evaluating the effects of deferasirox on liver iron concentration (LIC), labile plasma iron (LPI) and pharmacokinetics (PK) along with serum ferritin values in patients with IPSS Low- and Intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and evidence of iron overload. Twenty-four heavily transfused MDS patients were enrolled in a planned 52 weeks of therapy. PK studies showed dose-proportional total drug exposure. Data demonstrated that deferasirox was well tolerated and effectively reduced LIC, LPI and serum ferritin in the iron-overloaded patients with MDS who completed 24 and 52 weeks of therapy despite ongoing receipt of red blood cell transfusions.
