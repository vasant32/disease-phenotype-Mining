ETV6/TEL is the first transcription factor identified that is specifically required for hematopoiesis within the bone marrow. This gene has been found to have multiple fusion partners of which 16 have been cloned. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) revealed a t(1;12)(p36;p13) involving ETV6, with the breakpoint in this gene between exon 2 and exon 3. We report here the cloning of a novel ETV6 partner located on 1p36.1, involved in the t(1;12). 3' RACE-PCR from RNA identified a novel sequence fused to exon 2 of ETV6. Database searches localized this sequence in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mapped to 1p36 by fingerprint analysis. This result was confirmed by FISH using this BAC as probe. 5' and 3' RACE experiments with primers from this novel sequence were carried out on RNA from a healthy donor and identified a novel full-length mRNA, which we named MDS2 (myelodysplastic syndrome 2). RT-PCR experiments were performed on a panel of human cDNAs to analyze the expression pattern of this gene and they revealed four splicing variants. RT-PCR analysis showed that ETV6-MDS2, but not the reciprocal MDS2-ETV6 fusion transcript, was expressed in the bone marrow of the patient. The product of the ETV6-MDS2 fusion transcript predicts a short ETV6 protein containing the first 54 amino acids of ETV6 plus four novel amino acids, lacking both the PTN and the DNA-binding domains. Possible mechanisms to account for the development of MDS in this patient are discussed.
