The aim of this study was to investigate the tumor suppression efficacy of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium valproate combined with adriamycin in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome cell line MUTZ-1. After treated with different concentrations of sodium valproate alone, adriamycin alone or combination of them, growth curve of MUTZ-1 cell line were detected; growth of the tumor cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and morphology method. The results indicated that when the myelodysplastic syndrome cell line MUTZ-1 was treated with adriamycin (0.039 microg/ml, 0.078 microg/ml, 0.156 microg/ml, 0.312 microg/ml, 0.4 microg/ml), the tumor growth inhibition rates were 5.08 +/- 0.79%, 12.32 +/- 2.39%, 23.65 +/- 1.34%, 43.33 +/- 2.38% and 47.85 +/- 1.46% (p < 0.05), 0.25 mmol/L sodium valproate did not show apoptosis effect, but could synergize adriamycin to promote apoptosis. When the myelodysplastic syndrome cell line MUTZ-1 treated with two drug combination, the tumor growth inhibition rates were 23.46 +/- 1.12%, 49.87 +/- 0.84%, 52.37 +/- 1.05%, 78.43 +/- 4.34% and 82.47 +/- 1.04% (p < 0.05), and displayed concentration-dependent manner. All the data above were significantly different from those in control (p < 0.05). Sodium valproate showed obvious effect at concentration of 0.078 microg/ml adriamycin. After treated with 0.25 mmol/L sodium valproate and 0.078 microg/ml adriamycin for 72 hours, MUTZ-1 cell line showed typical apoptosis morphological character. It is concluded that sodium valproate may enhance the efficacy of adriamycin on MUTZ-1 cell line.
