Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative skin disorder usually associated with an underlying systemic disease. Head and neck involvement is rare, but possibly more common than once thought. The etiology of this disease is unclear, but may be related to an abnormal immunologic response. There are no pathognomonic histologic or laboratory findings; the diagnosis is made by the clinical appearance of the lesions and disease course. Treatment consists of immunosuppression and local wound care in addition to a search for and treatment of an underlying primary systemic disorder. A case report and review of the literature is presented with discussion of common head and neck manifestations, the differential diagnosis, and treatment alternatives.
