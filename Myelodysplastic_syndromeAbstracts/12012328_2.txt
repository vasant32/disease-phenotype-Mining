Recent studies have shown that point mutations in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and in the transformation of SCN to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is reasonably speculated that the abnormalities in the signal transduction pathways for G-CSF could be partly responsible for the pathogenesis and the development to AML in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Therefore, we investigated the structural and functional abnormalities of the G-CSFR in 14 patients with MDS and 10 normal subjects. In in vitro colony forming assay, MDS samples showed reduced response to growth factors. However, G-CSF, but not GM-CSF and IL-3, enhanced clonal growth in three cases of high risk patients with MDS (RAEB, RAEB-t, and MDS having progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and one low risk patient (RA). Eight out of 14 patients including above 4 patients demonstrated a common deletion of the G-CSFR cDNA; a deletion of three nucleotides (2128-2130) in the juxtamembrane domain of the G-CSFR, which resulted in a conversion of Asn(630)Arg(631) to Lys(630). To assess the functional activities of this deletion in the G-CSFR isoform, a mutant with the same three-nucleotide deletion was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. FDCP-2 cells expressing the G-CSFR isoform responded to G-CSF, and exhibited proliferative responses than did those cells having wild-type G-CSFR. Moreover, these isoforms showed prolonged activation of STAT3 in response to G-CSF than did the wild-type. These results suggest that the deletion in the juxtamembrane domain of the G-CSFR gives a growth advantage to abnormal MDS clones and may contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS.
