Results from two randomized trials have shown that oral beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is effective for treatment of acute gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease. Here, we report results of a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase II study designed to test the hypothesis that acute graft-versus-host disease could be prevented by administration of oral BDP, beginning before hematopoietic cell transplantation and continuing until day 75 after hematopoietic cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. Study drug (BDP or placebo) was administered as 1-mg immediate-release formulation plus 1-mg delayed-release formulation orally four times daily. According to the primary endpoint, systemic glucocorticoid treatment for graft-versus-host disease was given to 60 of the 92 participants (65%) in the BDP arm, versus 31 of 46 participants (67%) in the placebo arm. The secondary efficacy endpoints showed no statistically significant differences between the two arms. The proportion of participants who took at least 90% of the prescribed study drug during the first 4 weeks after hematopoietic cell transplantation was 54% overall. Lower severity of mucositis strongly correlated with higher adherence to the schedule of study drug administration. Inconsistent adherence related to mucositis during recovery after myeloablative conditioning may have obscured a beneficial therapeutic effect in the current study.
