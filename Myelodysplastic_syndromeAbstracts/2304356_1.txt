Bone marrow cultures and survival time were studied in 39 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes. We divided the patients into two groups according to the CFU-GM numbers on day 10: type I with low colony (CFU-GM less than 30) and type II with normal to high colony formation (CFU-GM greater than or equal to 30). The median survival time was shorter for patients with an in vitro growth type II (5 months) than it was for patients with an in vitro growth type I (greater than 36 months). No relations was found between growth types and FAB-type, Bournemouth score or initial karyotype. The initial bone marrow blast percentage correlated well with the in vitro growth number.
