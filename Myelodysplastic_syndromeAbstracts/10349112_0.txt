We studied 22 patients with hematological neoplasias which included: 12 patients with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) following the morphology and cytochemistry criteria established by FAB (French, American and British Committee), a Myeloblastic Leukemia secondary to MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and a biphenotypic acute leukemia where we established the relationship between the traditional peroxidase reaction with the anti-MPO by APAAP. We also carried out the nonspecific esterase reaction and determined the immunologic phenotype by FACS technology. The same procedure was used for the cellular analysis of the light chains kappa (kappa) and lambda (lambda) in 3 cases of hairy cell leukemia, one lymphoma and 4 cases of plasma cell neoplasia and reactive plasma cell disease. We conclude that immunocytochemical reactions must be used when morphology and traditional cytochemical reactions need to be confirmed in order to establish a correct diagnosis and this is specially important for B and T lymphomas. Their prognostic value is restricted and the results are useful as a complement to morphology, cytochemistry and immunological determinations.
