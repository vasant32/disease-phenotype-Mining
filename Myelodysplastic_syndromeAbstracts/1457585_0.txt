Hypoplastic acute leukemia (HAL) is characterized by pancytopenia and by hypocellularity of the bone marrow. The marrow contains equal to or more than 30% myeloblasts. Absence of tissue infiltrates and/or tumor masses is mandatory. Eight patients are described here. They do not fit into the FAB classification for either acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), except for one patient who subsequently proved to have a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The median age is 65 years. Two patients, including the CMML patient, are alive, 22 and 6 months from diagnosis. Six patients have died. The median survival is 8 months. Normal bone marrow cells cultured either with HAL sera or with HAL peripheral blood mononuclear cells as feeders and exogenous GM-CSF yielded subnormal CFU-GM counts. This might indicate inhibitory activity of HAL serum and defective stimulatory activity of HAL peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
