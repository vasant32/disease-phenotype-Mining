The results of a comprehensive study on 1,000 patients who had been cytogenetically diagnosed to have leukemia in our department since 1962 are reported, and the value of cytogenetic diagnosis for leukemia emphasized. In our series, we detected patients with FAB L1 and L2 showing an abnormality rate of 60 and 66%, respectively. They included 20% with Ph1 positive ALL. In FAB L3, we found t(8;14) in 5 of the 6 patients. The FAB M1 group showed the lowest abnormality rate (50%). Forty percent of the M2 patients exhibited t(8;21), 60% of which also showed loss of sex chromosome of either X or Y. Seventy-eight percent of the M3 patients presented t(15;17) (two patients with no detectable t(15;17) showed rearrangements of retinoic acid receptor alpha gene). Inversion of chromosome 16 was found in 10% of the patients with FAB M4. Patients with M6 exhibited relatively complex chromosomes aberrations. RAEB patients showed more frequent and complex type of chromosome aberrations than PARA patients. Cytogenetic and molecular-biological analyses provided valuable information on the pathophysiology of leukemia and suggested the possible localization of novel oncogene(s).
