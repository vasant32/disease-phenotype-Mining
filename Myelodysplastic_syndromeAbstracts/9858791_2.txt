Cytological and histological study of the bone marrow of 33 patients with malignant lymphoma was performed to evaluate (1) the occurrence of secondary myelodysplastic changes, (2) the cell lines involved and (3) whether secondary myelodysplastic changes were similar or different for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD). Different changes in erythro-, granulo- and megakaryopoiesis were revealed. Granulo- and erythropoiesis were disturbed more frequently. Morphological changes of the erythroid series, megaloblastoid maturation of the nucleus and multinuclearity, were seen more often in NHL patients. Cells of the granulocytic series demonstrated different changes: hypogranulation and hypersegmentation in NHL, hypergranulation and DÃ¶hle's bodies in HD. No remarkable dysplastic changes of megakaryopoiesis were demonstrated.
