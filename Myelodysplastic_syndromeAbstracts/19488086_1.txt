 BACKGROUND: A 77-year-old retired research pharmacologist with a long-standing history of anemia and a recent pathologically confirmed diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome was referred to a stroke unit for evaluation of slowly progressive cognitive deterioration, confusion and paroxysmal stroke-like episodes. A previous neurological work-up had revealed no noteworthy abnormalities except for chronic bilateral caudate infarctions seen on MRI and CT examinations of the brain. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, laboratory testing, brain MRI scanning, EEG, transesophageal echocardiography, cerebral angiography, CT scanning, and brain biopsy. DIAGNOSIS: Intravascular lymphomatosis of the brain. MANAGEMENT: Combined chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) and rituximab.
