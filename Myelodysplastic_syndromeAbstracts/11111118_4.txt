Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to detect chromosomal imbalances in 20 patients with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The results obtained were compared with G-banding analysis. This last methodology showed 50% of cases with clonal abnormalities whereas CGH detected 70% of cases with copy number changes. Gains were more frequent than losses and constituted 66% of total changes detected. The most common gains included chromosomes 21 and chromosome region 18p for AML and chromosome 17 and region 1p33p35 for MDS. Losses represent 34% of changes and the regions involved were 5q31q32, 7q22, 7p12 and 13q21q22. CGH revealed additional chromosome imbalances in 12 of 20 cases (60%) which were not detected by traditional cytogenetic studies, demonstrating complex karyotype in 50% (6/12). Combination of CGH and G-banding provides an efficient method to identify critical regions present in the malignant clone, which is of great value in the prognosis and outcome of myeloid neoplasias.
