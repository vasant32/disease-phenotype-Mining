 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess prognostic factors and outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) who received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 195 patients who received ASCT between 1985 and June 2005 were reviewed. Median time from first treatment to ASCT was 2.6 years (0.4-27.3). Demography at ASCT was 61% stage IV, median age 31 years (18-69), median prior treatment (tx) regimens 3 (2-7), median Hasenclever index 3 (0-6); 150 patients had responding disease [54 complete remission (CR), 96 partial remission (PR)], and 45 patients had untested relapse/refractory disease. RESULTS: Post-ASCT, 61% (119/195) patients attained CR with an overall response (CR + PR) of 85%. Twelve patients had nonrelapse mortality. Of 119 patients attaining CR, 27 relapsed: 3 after attaining CR for >5 years and 1 after attaining CR for >10 years. Median overall survival (OS)/progression-free survival (PFS) from ASCT was 9 years/2.9 years. Five-year OS/PFS was 55% of 44% and 10-year OS/PFS was 49.4% of 37% for whole group. Twenty (10%) patients developed second cancer (seven secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). Probability of developing second cancer at 10 years was 14.7% (95% confidence interval 8.9% to 23.8%) and 24.8% at 19 years. CONCLUSION: These data provide the longest follow-up reported for patients receiving ASCT for relapsed/refractory HL. In addition to previously described prognostic factors, our data show that Hasenclever index <3 influences outcome favorably and attaining CR at ASCT leads to a better outcome.
