Four consecutive children with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) underwent matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Ages ranged from 3.2 to 6.3 years. Diagnosis was assessed according to FAB classification: refractory anemia-RA (n = 1), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) (n = 1), and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) (n = 2). Initial treatment included transfusions for all of them, splenectomy (n = 2) and chemotherapy (n = 1). Patients were all prepared with busulfan 21 mg/kg (480 mg/m2), cytosine arabinoside 24,000 mg/m2, melphalan 140 mg/m2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis associated cyclosporine-methotrexate. Engraftment was prompt and complete in all children. Toxicity included severe mucositis (n = 3), moderate veno-occlusive disease (n = 2), acute GVHD (n = 3), chronic GVHD (n = 1). Sequelae have not yet been seen. All patients are alive and disease-free with a follow-up ranging from 7 to 35 months, with a Karnofsky score of 90-100%. Combined busulphan conditioning can offer an alternative to total body irradiation-based regimens in order to avoid late side-effects in children.
