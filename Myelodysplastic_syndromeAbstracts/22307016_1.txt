We previously reported that reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen with fludarabine, BU and 2.5 mg/kg of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) was effective but associated with a high rate of acute and chronic GVHD. Therefore, we increased the dose of r-ATG to 5 mg/kg. In this report, we analyzed 87 patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor from 2000 to 2010. RIC consisted of fludarabine, BU and r-ATG 2.5 mg/kg on 1 day (r-ATG1; n=53) or 2.5 mg/kg per day over 2 days (r-ATG2; n=22). Grade 2-4 acute GVHD incidence at day 100 was 30.2% and 8.8% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.038). Extensive chronic GVHD incidence was 60.4% and 12% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P<0.001). The relapse incidences (RI) at 24 months were 18.9% and 28.5% in r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.640). Overall and PFS were not different between the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups. r-ATG dose at 5 mg/kg in the setting of RIC seems a good balance allowing GVHD prevention and antitumor effect with a remarkable reduction of GVHD incidence without an identical level of increased relapse rate.
