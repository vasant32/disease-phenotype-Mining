Deletions of chromosome 11q[del(11q)] as part of a non-complex karyotype are infrequent in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), leaving the clinicopathologic and genetic features largely undefined. From three large medical centers over a 10-year period, we identified 32 MDS cases where del(11q) was present either as a sole (n=23) or associated with another abnormality (n=9), showing an overall 0.6% frequency in MDS. These patients included 15 men and 17 women, with a median age of 68 years. Three were therapy-related, and 29 were primary MDS. These cases were characterized by transfusion-dependent anemia (65%); frequent ring sideroblasts (RS) (59%); bone marrow hypocellularity (22%), and less severe thrombocytopenia. With a median follow-up of 32 months, 9/24 (38%) cases progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the overall survival (OS) was 35 months (3-105). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed MLL deletion in 6/10 cases, but no cryptic MLL translocations in all 15 MDS cases tested. In contrast, FISH performed in AML with del(11q) showed MLL rearrangement in 3/17 (18%) cases. In summary, del(11)q occurring in a non-complex karyotype is predominantly associated with primary MDS, lack of cryptic MLL rearrangements, and shows characteristic clinicopathological features. These clinicopathological features are likely attributed to commonly deleted regions of 11q and their involved genes.
