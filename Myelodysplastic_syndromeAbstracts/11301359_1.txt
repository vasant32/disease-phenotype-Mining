The molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis is a multistep process that is characterized by both activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In the present study, mutations of N-ras, p53 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) genes and loss of expression of the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) gene were analyzed in 59 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Mutations of N-ras, p53, and FLT-3 genes were detected in 7, 7, 1 of the 59 patients with MDS, respectively. Loss of DCC expression was detected in 16 patients. Type of MDS patients with N-ras mutation were all refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T). Abnormalities of p53 and DCC genes were significantly associated with survival time (p< 0.02, p< 0.004, respectively).
