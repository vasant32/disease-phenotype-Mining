Ten AML- and two MDS-patients in whom conventional chemotherapy was contraindicated or ineffective were treated with low dose ARA-C, 10 mg/m2 per 12hS.C. for 2-4 weeks. Seven patients obtained a complete and two a partial remission. Our findings suggest that low dose ARA-C may act both by induction of differentiation and/or inhibition of proliferation.
