Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is a recurrent abnormality, mainly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and it has been proposed therefore that the deleted region may contain a myeloid tumor suppressor gene. We have recently mapped a human translation termination factor gene, ETF1, to band 5q31 at D5S500, and thus to the smallest commonly deleted segment. We have evaluated ETF1 as a candidate myeloid tumor suppressor gene by analysis of the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60, and of patients suffering from malignant myeloid diseases with cytogenetically-defined abnormalities of chromosome 5. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed hemizygous loss of the ETF1 locus in HL60 cells and in four of five leukemic samples, but no inactivating mutations were identified by sequencing of the remaining ETF1 allele.
