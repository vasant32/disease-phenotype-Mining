Complete remission (CR) is the gold standard for assessing outcomes following chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). "CRp," a response criterion defined as fulfillment of all criteria for CR except platelet count recovery to ≥100 × 10(9)/L, is associated with inferior outcomes following chemotherapy. The prognostic importance of CRp before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains unknown. We analyzed a cohort of AML (n = 334) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 10) patients to determine the prognostic significance of achieving CR versus CRp before allo-SCT. At time of transplantation, 266 patients were in CR (CR1 and ≥CR2) and 78 in CRp (CR1p and ≥CR2p). Median follow-up was 38 months (3-131 months). Overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were most favorable in patients transplanted in CR (CR1 or ≥CR2) compared with CRp (CR1p or ≥CR2p). Achieving CR is therefore associated with improved posttransplantation outcomes compared with achieving CRp and is a significant prognostic factor that needs to be considered when evaluating AML/MDS patients for clinical trials and allo-SCT.
