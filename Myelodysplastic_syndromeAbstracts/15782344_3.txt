We report a 36-year-old male with myeloid/natural killer (NK)-cell precursor acute leukaemia with a complex aberrant karyotype, who was treated according to an acute-myeloid-leukaemia (AML) treatment protocol (idarubicine, cytarabine, and etoposide) followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation and achieved complete remission. He underwent allogeneic matched unrelated donor (MUD) peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and remained in remission throughout his remaining life. Seven months posttransplantation, a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with (20q-) of donor origin was diagnosed causing severe thrombocytopenia and finally leading to infection and death. This patient represents one of the few cases published achieving remission for a significant period of time after being diagnosed with myeloid/NK-cell precursor acute leukaemia, a very rare malignant disease. We conclude, despite the fatal outcome due to infection, that allogeneic PBSCT is a therapeutic option for patients with this entity. In addition, the development of a myelodysplastic syndrome of donor origin is extremely rare and only very few cases are published worldwide.
