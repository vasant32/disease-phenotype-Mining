We determined nine immune function parameters at diagnosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and correlated the results with the FAB classification and prognosis by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with refractory anaemia (RA) and refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RAS) tended to have a higher CD4/CD8 ratio and a lower amount of gamma-globulins and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in serum in comparison to those suffering from the other three subgroups of MDS. FAB classification, neutrophil and CD8+ T-cell number had the best discriminatory capacity for predicting survival less than 1 year, and FAB classification, neutrophil number and serum TNF levels were predictors for conversion to acute leukaemia. The frequent occurrence of infections, on the other hand, could be better predicted by the absolute numbers of neutrophils and CD4+ cells and by the skin test score.
