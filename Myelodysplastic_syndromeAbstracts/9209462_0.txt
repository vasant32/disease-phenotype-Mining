Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome associated with eosinophilia showed a complex translocation with a 46,XY,t(2;18;2)(p23;q11;q32) karyotype. The patient has refractory anemia (RA) according to the French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB) classification, and after 90 months of follow-up he shows no evidence of leukemic transformation. This chromosomal abnormality has not been previously described in myelodysplastic syndromes and may be associated with good prognosis as the patient has been stable for a long time.
