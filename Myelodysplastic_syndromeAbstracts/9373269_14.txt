The relationship between differentiation of human myeloid cells and apoptosis remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that terminal differentiation need not necessarily lead to the apoptotic demise of myeloid cells, while other studies have shown that induction of differentiation is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents, such as chemotherapy and gamma-irradiation. Such results are pertinent to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, where differentiating agents and hemopoietic growth factors are being combined with chemotherapy to enhance response and limit toxicity. To elucidate the factors governing apoptosis in human AML blasts, we have studied the cytotoxic effect of idarubicin on HL60, U937 and KG1 cells, after incubation with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ). We show that prior incubation of human myeloid leukemic cells with ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 D3 induced resistance to idarubicin-induced apoptosis, which was modulated by coincubation with GM-CSF. The altered chemosensitivity of cells depended on the degree of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest induced by incubation with ATRA, 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and GM-CSF and was independent of differentiation status or Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression. These findings suggest that cell-cycle arrest in human leukemic cells can be induced by exogenous agents and may promote drug resistance. Determining the mechanisms by which cell-cycle arrest is induced may permit understanding of the processes by which the cells escape cytotoxic drug-mediated apoptosis.
