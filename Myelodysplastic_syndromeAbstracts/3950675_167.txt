Clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic features in 63 patients with a therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL) following cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy for a previous disease were analyzed. Eleven patients had received only radiotherapy for the primary disorder. In most cases, high doses had been administered to treatment ports that included the pelvic or spinal bone marrow. Twenty-one patients had received only chemotherapy for their primary disease, all for more than 1 year and all but one with an alkylating agent, either alone or in combination with other drugs. Thirty-one patients had received both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, either concurrently or sequentially. A clonal chromosomal abnormality was observed in marrow or blood cells from 61 of the 63 patients (97%). Fifty-five patients (87%) had a clonal abnormality of chromosomes no. 5 and/or 7 consisting of loss of all or part of the long arm of the chromosome. The critical chromosome region that was consistently deleted in all 17 patients with del(5q) comprised bands q23 to q32. In addition to nos. 5 and 7, five other chromosomes (no. 1, 4, 12, 14, and 18) were found to be nonrandomly involved. Both t-MDS and t-ANLL are late complications of cytotoxic therapies that have distinctive clinical and histologic features and are associated with characteristic aberrations of chromosomes no. 5 and 7. It seems likely that these two chromosomes contain genes involved in the pathogenesis of these hematopoietic neoplasms.
