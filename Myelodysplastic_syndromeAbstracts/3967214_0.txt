The frequency and distribution of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was determined in bone marrow and peripheral lymphocytes of patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients with refractory anemia (RA), RA with excess of blasts (REAB), RA with ring sideroblasts, and RA in transformation presented a 2-3-fold increase in SCE frequency in the bone marrow cells. In contrast, lymphocytes from these patients showed only a marginal increase in SCE. Analysis of interchromosomal distribution of SCE indicated a preferential involvement of chromosomes in group C in patients with RA with excess of blasts. Furthermore, the SCE in patients was not found to be influenced by the karyotype status.
