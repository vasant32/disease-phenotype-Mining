HuM195 is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody reactive with CD33, a Mr 67,000 glycoprotein expressed on early myeloid progenitor cells and myeloid leukemia cells. HuM195 has been shown to rapidly target and saturate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells after i.v. infusion into patients and is capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This activity is enhanced in vitro when natural killer (NK) effector cells are preincubated with low concentrations of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Previous Phase I trials of HuM195 in patients with relapsed AML demonstrated safety and attainment of complete responses, but significant antileukemic activity appears limited to patients with low leukemia tumor burdens. Therefore, in the present trial, we sought to determine whether low-dose IL-2 could safely enhance the numbers of NK cells and therefore the cytotoxic capability of HuM195 via presumptive NK cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vivo against myeloid leukemia cells. Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory AML and one patient with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with 0.6x10(6) IU/m2 of s.c. IL-2 daily for 35 days. Starting on day 15, patients received twice weekly i.v. infusions of HuM195 (3.0 mg/m2) for 3 weeks. Immediately after the HuM195 infusion, the patients received IL-2 i.v. infusions over 2 h at one of three escalating dose levels of 0.5x10(6), 1.0x10(6), and 2.0x10(6) IU/m2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantitated and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Safety, tolerability, bone marrow mononuclear cell morphology, and immunophenotype, as well as responses were assessed. Of the 14 patients who entered the study, 10 were able to complete at least one cycle of therapy. Adverse effects to the s.c. IL-2 were relatively mild and included erythema and induration of the skin at the injection site and low-grade fever. Toxicity from the sequential HuM195 and i.v. IL-2 infusions included nausea, rigors, and fever. Toxicity was IL-2 dose related with dose-limiting toxicity seen at the 2.0x10(6) IU/m2 dose level. Three patients had stable disease at the completion of the first cycle and went on to receive a second cycle of treatment. CD3-positive, CD56-positive, and CD33-positive cells were generally found to significantly decrease immediately after each administration of i.v. IL-2 and HuM195. CD56-expressing cells increased in 6 of 10 patients from the beginning to the end of therapy. Among the 10 evaluable patients, 2 patients had significant decreases in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow (one of which achieved a complete bone marrow remission), 5 patients had stable levels of bone marrow blasts, and 3 had progression of disease on therapy. The combination of IL-2 and HuM195 shows modest biological activity and clinical antileukemic activity but also produced significant toxicity.
