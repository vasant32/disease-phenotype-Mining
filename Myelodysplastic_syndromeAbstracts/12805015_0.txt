The clinical, hematological, and cytogenetic data from a 4 year-old child with acute myeloid (AML-M1) and basophilia is reported. Interestingly, cytogenetic investigations revealed the presence of the translocation t(6;9) (p23;q34). This abnormality is rare and associated with myelodysplastic syndromes or with subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (M1, M2, M4, M7), usually with preceding or underlying myelodysplasia. The prognosis is poor, without response to chemotherapy regimen alone. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation appears likely to be a more appropriate treatment.
