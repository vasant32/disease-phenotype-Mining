By using polymerase chain reaction and differential hybridization, point mutations of N-ras oncogene were investigated among 43 patients with hematopoietic malignancies. Six cases were revealed to carry mutational N-ras oncogenes. One case with acute myelocytic leukemia was found to carry a mutation at codon 13, although this case was in complete remission.
