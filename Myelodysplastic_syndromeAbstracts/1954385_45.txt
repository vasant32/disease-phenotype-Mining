We have studied 20 children with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were 3 months to 16 years old at diagnosis of their primary neoplasm and 1 to 24 years old at diagnosis of their secondary neoplasm. The median interval from initial treatment for the first malignancy to diagnosis of therapy-related MDS or AML was 46 months (range, 12 to 116 months). Twelve patients had chromosomal abnormalities resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, three patients had abnormalities of chromosome 11 band q23, one patient had both classes of abnormalities, three patients had other abnormalities, and one patient had a normal karyotype. Ten of 12 patients with chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities had been exposed to an alkylating agent, and two of three patients with 11q23 abnormalities had been exposed to an epipodophyllotoxin. The patient with both classes of abnormalities had been exposed to both types of therapy. We conclude that abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 are common in children with therapy-related MDS or AML. The proposed relationships between exposure to alkylating agents and abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 and between exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and abnormalities of 11q23 are supported in this pediatric series.
