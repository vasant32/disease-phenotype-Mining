Epoetin alfa is being used to treat patients with symptomatic anemia of cancer and to prevent or postpone chemotherapy-induced anemia in cancer treatment. As only approximately 50% of unselected anemic cancer patients respond sufficiently to epoetin alfa treatment, careful patient selection according to reliable prediction criteria is of great importance. Predictions of response to epoetin alfa treatment are based either on the degree of blunted erythropoietin response to the anemic condition or on indicators of responsiveness during the early treatment phase. The most accurate predictions of responsiveness, however, are derived from combinations of predictive factors. Combinations of synergistically acting hematopoietic growth factors, particularly epoetin alfa and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, are beneficial to selected patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and may prolong survival in certain cases. Correction of anemia in cancer patients is particularly important because highly significant correlations have been reported between hemoglobin levels and quality of life in these patients.
