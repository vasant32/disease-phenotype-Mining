OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of hypermethylation of the calcitonin (CT) gene in malignant hematological disorders (MHD). METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with digestion of DNA with Hpa II was used to examine the methylation patterns of the CT gene in 73 patients with MHD, 6 healthy people and 24 patients with nonmalignant hematological disorders (NON-MHD). RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the CT gene occurred in 12 of 14 (85.7%) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 9 of 15 (60%) acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 8 of 10 (80%) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 5 of 15 (33.3%) malignant lymphoma (ML), 2 of 5 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 1 of 2 malignant histiocytosis (MH), 1 of 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 1 of 9 multiple myeloma (MM). However, it did not occur in normal controls and NON-MHD. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of CT gene may serve as an important molecular maker for tumorous cell clone and may be useful in diagnosing MHD, monitoring minimal residual disease and predicting prognosis.
