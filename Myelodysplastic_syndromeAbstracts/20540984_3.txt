 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) on leukemia cell growth and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation was conducted using the MTS assay, cell-cycle analysis, and division tracking. Apoptosis was investigated by Annexin-V/7-aminoactinomycin D and caspase-3 expression. The effect of GSK-3β inhibitors was also tested in vivo in an animal model of leukemia. Gene expression analysis was performed to identify the genes modulated by GSK-3β inhibition in leukemia cells. RESULTS: GSK-3β inhibitors suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in seven leukemia cell lines of diverse origin, four acute myeloid leukemia, one myelodysplastic syndrome, and one acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. GSK-3β inhibitors are cytotoxic for rapidly dividing clonogenic leukemia blasts, and higher doses of the inhibitors are needed to eliminate primitive leukemia progenitor/stem cells. Slow cell-division rate, low drug uptake, and interaction with bone marrow stroma make leukemia cells more resistant to apoptosis induced by GSK-3β inhibitors. Global gene expression analysis combined with functional approaches identified multiple genes and specific signaling pathways modulated by GSK-3β inhibition. An important role for Bcl2 in the regulation of apoptosis induced by GSK-3β inhibitors was defined by expression analysis and confirmed by using pharmacological inhibitors of the protein. In vivo administration of GSK-3β inhibitors delayed tumor formation in a mouse leukemia model. GSK-3β inhibitors did not affect hematopoietic recovery following irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support further evaluation of GSK-3β inhibitors as promising novel agents for therapeutic intervention in leukemia and warrant clinical investigation in leukemia patients.
