We retrospectively studied four cases of t-MDS/AML among 210 (1.9%) consecutive patients with CLL treated at a single center with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) either as the first- or second-line therapy. The median follow-up of the whole cohort of patients was 46months (range: 7-60). Two of these patients (2/130, 1.7%) had been treated with FC only, and two more (2/80, 2.3%) with CHOP and CHOP+FND, respectively, prior to FC. The median age was 61.5years (range: 49-71); three were male. They developed t-MDS/AML after a median latency period of 41months (range: 7-56) from the FC completion. Chromosomal aberrations with an adverse prognostic impact were present in the karyotype of all four patients, including abnormalities of chromosome 5 in three of them, and a rare chromosomal translocation in one patient. Median survival after t-MDS/AML diagnosis was 4months (range: 2-8). Although the agents administered prior to FC make it difficult to assess the risk of t-MDS/AML attributable to FC, this report might be a valuable addition to the literature.
