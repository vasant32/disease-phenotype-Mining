 OBJECTIVE: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is recognized as a preleukemic disorder with a variable risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Usually the blast cells in leukemia are transformed after MDS displays a myeloid phenotype. Lymphoid progression had been reported as myeloid-lymphoid hybrid or early B phenotype, but our patient transformed acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia, which is a rare lymphoid transformation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: We present a case of refractory anemia with excess of blast that transformed into acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. MDS was diagnosed in a 69-year-old man in April 2007. Twelve month later, he developed T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The blasts were positive for expression of CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD45, and HLA-DR, leading to a diagnosis of T-lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, but he died of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of lymphoid transformation is not yet fully understood. This case clinically supports the nature of MDS as a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder. MDS often transforms into acute leukemia, usually of a myeloid phenotype. The transformation of MDS into acute lymphoblastic leukemia is extremely rare.
