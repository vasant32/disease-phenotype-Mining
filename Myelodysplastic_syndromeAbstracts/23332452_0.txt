Azacitidine's efficacy in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) has not been well-studied. In our retrospective review of 84 t-MN patients treated with azacitidine, median overall survival (OS) was 14.5 months and overall response rate was 43%, including 11% complete remission, 4% marrow complete remission, and 11% partial remission. In patients who underwent allogeneic transplant (25%), median OS was 19.2 versus 12.8 months (P=0.023) for those who did not. Response rates were comparable to those reported for de novo myelodysplastic syndrome. When we analyzed outcomes according to five scoring systems, only the Global MD Anderson Risk Model predicted survival with statistical significance.
