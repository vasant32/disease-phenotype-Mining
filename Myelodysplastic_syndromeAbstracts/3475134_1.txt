Bone marrow myeloblasts in 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were quantitated with monoclonal antibodies using the immunoalkaline phosphatase technique. Positive blasts were identified in 7 of the 15 cases with at least one of three antibodies reactive with acute myelomonocytic leukaemic cells (PMN-6, PMN-29, AML 2-23) which were non-reactive with normal myeloblasts. In 5 of these cases increased PM-81 positivity was associated with expression of at least one of the other antigens (PM-81 antibody reacts with all types of acute myeloid leukaemic cells and a certain percentage of normal myeloblasts). The data suggest an aberration of myeloid differentiation in myelodysplastic syndromes which is reflected in altered surface marker features.
