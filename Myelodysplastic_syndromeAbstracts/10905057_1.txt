The treatment of patients with aggressive subclasses of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains a challenge. In an effort to improve the survival of patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), or acute myelogenous leukemia transformed from MDS (MDS-AML), we conducted a small trial in which 28 such patients were treated with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAraC) followed by administration of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The overall rate of response to the treatment was 61%, including 39% with a complete response, which is higher than rates obtained in previous studies in which LDAraC alone was administered to patients with MDS. Median survival was 23.5 months in cases of RAEB, 16.7 months in cases of RAEB-t, and 19.7 months in cases of MDS-AML. The overall survival of the study group appeared to be prolonged in comparison with a historical control group of patients treated with LDAraC alone. It is suggested that M-CSF added to the administration of LDAraC plays an active role in the therapy. No therapy-related death occurred. Some unique actions of M-CSF were suggested in this trial. It is concluded that therapy with LDAraC + M-CSF is a useful treatment option for patients with aggressive subclasses of MDS and MDS-AML to provide better response and survival.
