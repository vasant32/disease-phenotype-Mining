A patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome ([MDS], i.e., refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts [RARS]) and a rapidly fatal clinical course is presented. A cytogenetic analysis showed an isochromosome 17q as a sole abnormality in all metaphases. An association between RARS and i(17q) has not been reported. Furthermore, a mutation of the remaining TP53 gene in exon 6 was evidenced by a single strand conformation polymorphism technique. This unique case illustrates heterogeneity of phenotypic expression of a stem cell disorder in MDS and indicates precaution in classifying hematologic syndromes especially when morphology is correlated with specific cytogenetic changes.
