The effect of an ex vivo expansion culture system using multiple cytokine combinations was evaluated in 38 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with the aim of overcoming the defective in vitro growth of haemopoietic progenitor cells. A combination of four growth factors (GF) including SCF, IL-3, IL-6 and GM-CSF was identified as the optimal combination for expanding clonogenic progenitor cells in MDS bone marrow liquid cultures. The cultures of 50% of the patients (19/38) responded to GF stimulation (mean CFU-GM fold increase 15.65+/-48 at week 4) and showed morphological features of normal and/or dysplastic myeloid differentiation. In 12/38 cases (31%), complete unresponsiveness to multiple cytokine stimulation was observed; a small number of patients (7/38) showed progressive leukaemic growth along the cultures with the presence of 100% immature blasts at week 4. GM-CSF and c-kit receptors, analysed by immuno-histochemistry in 10 patients, were over-expressed in responding patients and either lacking or down-regulated in non-responders. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of cultured interphase cells of nine patients (trisomy 8 in eight patients) showed a clear-cut increase in the percentage of cells with three signals in the two responding patients, thus indicating the expansion of a MDS clone. Multiple cytokine liquid cultures seem to be able to override the refractoriness of MDS progenitor cells to GF stimulation in many cases, revealing a heterogeneity which may have prognostic implications and should be considered in ex-vivo and in vivo clinical trials with cytokine combinations.
