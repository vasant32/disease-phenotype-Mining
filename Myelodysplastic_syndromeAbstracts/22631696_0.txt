We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with targeted oral busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) in a phase II study. Busulfan (1.0 mg/kg) was given initially in six doses. Based on the estimated concentration at steady state after the first dose of BU, subsequent (7th-16th) doses were adjusted to obtain a targeted overall concentration at steady state of 700-900 ng/mL. The primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival (OS). Fifty patients were registered and 46 (median age, 53 years; range, 18-62 years) received planned transplant, including 24 with AML, 16 with myelodysplastic syndrome, and six with CML. Fourteen patients were categorized as standard risk. Nineteen patients received transplant from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings, 27 from unrelated donors. The BU dose required reduction in 32 patients and escalation in six patients. One-year OS was 65% (95% confidence interval, 50-77%). Cumulative incidence of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was 11%. One-year transplant-related mortality was 18%. Both OS and transplant-related mortality were favorable in this study, including patients of older age and with high risk diseases. Individual dose adjustment based on BU pharmacokinetics was feasible and effective in the current phase II study. This trial is registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry System (UMIN-CTR, ID:C000000156).
