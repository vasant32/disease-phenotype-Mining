Endonucleases capable of producing internucleosomal DNA cleavage are one of the key enzymes in apoptosis. We examined endonuclease activities contained in nuclei of CD34+ and erythroid cells in the bone marrow (BM) from 12 patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes. The levels of Mg(2+)-dependent and acidic endonucleases showed little changes as compared with those from normal BM. By contrast, the level of Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease was appreciably higher in MDS erythroid cells than normal counterparts, although the activity varied markedly in CD34+ and erythroid cells. Our results suggested that Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease is related to ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS.
