Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been proven to be an important tool in interphase cytogenetics of solid tumors. Although, because of methodological implications, balanced aberrations are not detected by CGH, the technique has uncovered a variety of new and interesting imbalanced karyotype changes. However, only a few studies deal with its application to hematologic disorders, although this is a main topic of cytogenetics. The aim of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the usefulness of CGH in the examination of hematologic neoplasms. For this purpose, bone marrow aspirates of 33 patients with different hematologic disorders were examined with CGH and the results compared with conventional cytogenetics (CC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CGH showed chromosome changes in 8 of 33 cases. CC found balanced aberrations in 4 of 33 and unbalanced changes in 9 of 33 samples. Differences between CGH and CC in unbalanced aberrations were seen in four cases. In these samples, either the number of aberrant cells found by CC was low and, therefore, difficult to detect by CGH, or complex aberrations in different cell clones as seen in CC were lumped together as one karyotype by CGH. In one sample, CC was not capable of giving any results at all, whereas CGH showed trisomy 8. CGH was also helpful in defining the bands involved in the structural aberrations, which was difficult by CC in some cases because of the low quality of metaphase spreads. All results obtained by CGH were confirmed by FISH, whereas CC and FISH were discordant in one case. Although CGH was not able to detect all aberrations, it gave important additional information for the correct localization of the aberrations found in CC, and it was most helpful in samples not processed successfully in CC. These advantages would open up a new field of application for CGH not only for research, but also for diagnostic purposes.
