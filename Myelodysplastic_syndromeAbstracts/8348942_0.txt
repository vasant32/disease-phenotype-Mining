The red cell ferritin (rFt) level in 10 patients with refractory anemia (RA) was measured and analyzed by column isoelectric focusing (IEF). The levels in 9 of the 10 patients (90.0%) were higher than the upper limit in healthy controls (MV +/- SD: male 14.3 +/- 10.3 ag/cell, female 7.5 +/- 3.6 ag/cell). The isoelectric point (pI) of rFt determined by IEF in healthy subjects ranged from 5.1 to 5.7. However, the pI ranges for RA patients varied widely; the pI value was thought to correlate with the severity of the morphological abnormalities of bone marrow (BM) erythroblasts. That is, the greater the proportion of morphologically abnormal erythroblasts with respect to all erythroid precursors, the lower the pI range for rFt. The rFt content was not related to serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, reticulocyte count, red cell iron content, or BM erythroblast count. These data suggest that rFt synthesis in RA patients is influenced by factor(s) other than iron; this is considered an essential feature of erythropoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
