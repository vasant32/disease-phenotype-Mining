We studied MDS-associated inhibitory activity, which inhibited colony formation in vitro of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM). Macrophages obtained from MDS bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) when pretreated with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) suppressed the growth of normal CFU-GM. These macrophages were designated as 'MDS-derived inhibitory macrophages'. Media conditioned by MDS-derived inhibitory macrophages (MDS-CM) also suppressed the growth of normal CFU-GM. In the MDS-CM, high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and ferritin were found. However, MDS-CM did not contain detectable levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). Antiserum against human placental ferritin and/or against PGE2 blocked the haemopoietic inhibitory activity to some extent. These results suggest that inhibitory macrophages may be responsible for the suppression of granulopoiesis in patients with MDS and that the suppression may be mediated by soluble factors including PGE2 and ferritin.
