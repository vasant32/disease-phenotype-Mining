The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases with different prognosis and evolution. Most of the studies on prognostic factors performed previously have independently evaluated the clinico-hematologic or cytogenetic data at diagnosis. In the present paper, 46 primary MDS were clinically, hematologically, and cytogenetically investigated at diagnosis, in order to determine the principal factors affecting the survival probability between a great number of characteristics. A univariate regression analysis of all the data allows one to recognize that the main factors are: the complexity of karyotype (p = 0.00001), the percentage of type I and total marrow blast cells (p = 0.001), and the abnormal localized immature myeloid precursors' (ALIP) presence (p = 0.001). Twenty-five patients underwent consecutive studies during their evolution. The karyotype instability gives information both on the likely evolution to acute leukemia and on poor survival.
