Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a rare extramedullary solid tumour composed of malignant immature cells of the granulocytic series. It may herald, accompany or signal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). GS may also occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) where it is a sign of imminent disease progression. Three cases of GS are presented; the first one involving the pancreas and preceding AML, the second case affecting uterine cervix in stable phase CGL and the third case is GS of the breast accompanying AML. Any site of the body may be involved by the GS, and morbidity depends on the local organ/tissue affected in addition to the attending primary leukaemia or MDS. Treatment of GS involves surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The objective of this communication is to enhance awareness in personnel providing health care. Further, early diagnosis and treatment affects overall outcome.
