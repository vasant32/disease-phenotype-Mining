To explore the relationship between the expression of CD133 and pathogenesis of leukemia and MDS, immunocytochemistry method was used to examine the expression of CD133 in bone marrow cells of patients with leukemia and MDS. The results showed that the positive rate of CD133 in 41 acute leukemia patients was 51.2%. The expression of CD133 in AML patients (16/29, 55.2%) was significantly higher than that in control group (2/15, 13.3%). There was no significant difference in CD133 expression between CML and control group. The positive rate of CD133 in 9 patients with MDS was 55.56% (5/9). There was no significant difference between MDS and normal control. The expression of CD133 in all leukemia cells with CD34(+) was higher than that in leukemia cells with CD34(-), and there was significant difference in expression of CD133 between them (P < 0.05). The expression of CD133 had no relationship with the clinical prognostic factors such as sex, age, the percentage of leukemic cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow, WBC counts, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts and LDH level. It is concluded that the expression of CD133 in bone marrow cells of patients with AML is higher than that in control group. The expression of CD133 is significantly correlated with the expression of CD34. The high expression of CD133 may be an adverse prognostic factor in acute leukemia.
