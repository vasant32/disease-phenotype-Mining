The putative tumour suppressor gene gravin is down-regulated in several solid tumours and is implicated in tumorigenesis. We have evaluated the expression levels of the gravin gene in the CD34(+)/blast cells of a range of myeloid malignancies as compared with controls using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Gravin was markedly down-regulated in 41 of 41 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), nine of 10 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 33 of 33 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), of whom 24 were in blast crisis (BC). We have shown that gravin is consistently down-regulated in the CD34(+)/blast cells of myeloid malignancies and may play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders.
