To investigate the cytogenetic and clinical characteristics of inv(3q) (q21q26) and t(3;3) (q21; q26) aberrations as well as prognosis, cases were collected and chromosome specimens of bone marrow cells were prepared by 24-hour culture, while G-banding technique was used to perform karyotyping. The results showed that the simple inv(3q) and t(3; 3) aberrations were rare, they commonly combined with other chromosome aberrations such as -7/7q- and t (9; 22). The involved diseases included myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. Out of 24 patients, 2 patients diagnosed with M(5) subtype did not achieve complete remission after multiple chemotherapy; 2 patients received allogenic stem cell transplantation relapsed. It is concluded that 3q21q26 aberration commonly combined with chromosome aberration 7/7q-, for these patients the efficacy of chemical therapy is poor, the efficacy of bone marrow transplant is too poor, these patients with inv(3q) and t(3; 3) aberrations have poor prognosis and short overall survival.
