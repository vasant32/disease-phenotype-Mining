 PURPOSE: This study describes changes in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in patients during chemotherapy before anemia treatment and in those who received no treatment, measuring time from chemotherapy initiation to Hb less than 10 g/dL and anemia treatment initiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study used a database of outpatient oncology practice electronic medical records from January 1, 2006, to August 6, 2009. Unit of analysis was episode of chemotherapy care, beginning at initiation and including consecutive administrations within the next 60 days. Patients received two or more administrations of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, had a cancer diagnosis with at least 60 days of follow-up, and had no myelodysplastic syndrome. A total of 4,864 episodes (4,021 patients) met selection criteria, 73% with baseline Hb of 11 g/dL or greater and 60% receiving no anemia treatment. RESULTS: Episodes without anemia treatment increased from 44.6% (2006) to 77.8% (2009). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) use decreased from 45.4% (2006) to 11.5% (2009). Patients receiving transfusions increased from 3.4% to 8.7% (2006 to 2009; all P < .001). Total proportion of episodes with Hb less than 10 g/dL at anemia treatment increased from 16.2% to 93.1% during the same period (P < .001). Mean Hb values before anemia treatment decreased over time from 10.8 to 8.9 g/dL (2006 to 2009; P < .001). Overall, time from chemotherapy initiation to first anemia treatment increased from 24.7 to 36.9 days (2006 to 2009; P < .01). CONCLUSION: Results suggest increased restrictions were associated with decreased use of ESAs and increased use of transfusions as well as delays in anemia treatment and lower Hb levels before anemia treatment. Additional investigation of the overall impact of delayed treatments on long-term patient outcomes is warranted.
