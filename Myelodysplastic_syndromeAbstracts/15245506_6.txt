We report the use of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)-matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation as a method of establishing a graft-vs.-leukaemia (GvL) effect against myeloid disorders using a fludarabine-melphalan protocol without the use of T-lymphocyte-depleting antibodies. The 16 patients in this group had predominantly poor-risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n=10), AML/myelodysplasia (MDS) (n=2) and MDS (n=4). All but one patient achieved full haematopoietic engraftment. Thirteen of 16 patients are alive and in continued complete remission on completion of this study with a median follow-up of 426 d (range 83-1524). The actuarial 4 yr disease-free and overall survival is 79% for both. Only one patient relapsed following transplant, giving a relapse rate of 6% during the study period. The treatment-related mortality was 13% (n= 2). Overall, acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) occurred in 53% (8/15), with acute GvHD grade II or above occurring in 47% (7/15). In the 13 evaluable patients, chronic GvHD occurred in 46% (6/13), with this being extensive in three patients. These results suggest that a GvL effect can be delivered against poor-risk myeloid disorders with a low non-relapse mortality using this fludarabine-melphalan RIC protocol.
