Secondary acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are known to develop in patients previously treated with different chemotherapeutic regimens. Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been demonstrated in these therapy-related myeloid disorders which often evolve into refractory AML. The prognosis of these patients with conventional chemotherapy has been dismal and only allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers a potential cure. We describe two patients who developed MDS after chemo/radiotherapy and had a spontaneous recovery. One patient was treated with MOPP-ABVD hybrid therapy for Hodgkin's disease, developed pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia and dyserythropoiesis associated with monosomy 7. The other was treated with a combination of chemotherapy including VP-16 for Ewing's sarcoma, developed thrombocytopenia, marrow hypoplasia and dyserythropoiesis associated with an 11q23 translocation. Both patients received rhG-CSF after their cycles of chemotherapy and were considered for a bone marrow transplant. Marrow aspirates at frequent intervals showed gradual disappearance of the abnormal clone with parallel normalization of the peripheral count. In both patients G-CSF might have played a role in the development of the abnormal clone. We suggest that patients with therapy-related MDS without excess of blasts could be closely monitored for karyotypic and hematological improvement rather than transplanted immediately.
