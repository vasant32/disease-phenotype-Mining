Numerous agents induce differentiation and maturation of neoplastic and dysplastic myeloid cells in vitro and some of these agents have been used with limited success in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloid leukaemias. We recently proposed that physiological and pharmacological agents which enhance differentiation and maturation in vitro act by two fundamentally different routes: (1) by hastening the progression through various differentiation/maturation steps; (2) by slowing proliferation (usually by inhibition of DNA synthesis). In order to test this thesis we looked for synergistic effects on differentiation using pairs of agents from the two groups in cultures of cells from myelodysplastic and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and from normal marrow donors. The results with three MDS, two AML and three normal samples show that combinations of differentiation inducing agents (retinoic acid, N-methylformamide) with DNA synthesis inhibitors (6-mercaptopurine, cytosine arabinoside and aphidicolin) produce a differentiation inducing effect equivalent to that of 10-100, or even 1000 fold higher concentrations of single agents. Myelotoxic effects in vitro were not synergistic. The use of these synergistic combinations should greatly enhance the usefulness of differentiation inducers in the therapy of MDS and myeloid leukaemia.
