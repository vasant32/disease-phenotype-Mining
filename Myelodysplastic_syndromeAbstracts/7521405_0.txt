A 42-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of pancytopenia in April 1992. A diagnosis of refractory anemia was made. The karyotype was normal male type on the initial study. Subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) initially increased the peripheral neutrophil count, bat in January 1993, although blast cells did not increase, neutrophils had decreased in spite of the continuation of G-CSF administration. Chromosome analysis showed 46XY, +Y, -7 at this point. By adding 50 mg of cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC) daily, the peripheral neutrophil count again rose dramatically. However, anemia, thrombocytopenia and the chromosomal abnormality were unchanged. These results indicate that SPAC may upregulate the effect of G-CSF on granulopoiesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
