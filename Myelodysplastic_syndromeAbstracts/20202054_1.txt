 BACKGROUND: Skin manifestations associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may reveal bone marrow transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of skin manifestations associated with MDS. In addition, we evaluated the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia transformation associated with skin manifestations. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 157 patients with primary MDS followed up prospectively for a median of 44 months. Skin lesions were prospectively assessed as part of medical examination every 6 months by a board certified dermatologist. Survival analyses were performed to assess the association between the presence of skin lesions and the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (9.55%) experienced skin lesions previously reported as associated with MDS. These were neutrophilic dermatosis (7, 4.46%), specific lesions (5, 3.18%), cutaneous vasculitis (2, 1.27%) and Beh√ßet disease (1, 0.63%). Survival analysis showed that the risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia was slightly but not significantly increased in patients with skin lesions as compared with patients without skin lesions with a relative risk of 2.08 (95% CI 0.92-4.67). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of skin lesions, mostly neutrophilic dermatosis and specific lesions, is relatively high in patients with MDS. There is a trend for a higher risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia in patients with skin lesions.
