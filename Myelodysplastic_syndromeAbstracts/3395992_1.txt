An identical translocation, t(11;21)(q24;q11.2), has been observed in three patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome. In all cases, duplication of the 11q+ marker and loss of the normal chromosome 11 were observed either at diagnosis or during the evolution of the disease. This apparently characteristic chromosome abnormality has not been previously described.
