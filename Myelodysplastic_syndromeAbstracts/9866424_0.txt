We report two cases of cytarabine (Ara-C) induced pericarditis. The first patient was a 61-year-old man with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with trilineage myelodysplasia (M2). Fever and pericardial effusion developed after treatment with low-dose Ara-C and etoposide (VP16) during the patient's second leukemic relapse. The second patient was a 65-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transformed into AML (M2). He achieved a complete remission after treatment with low-dose Ara-C and VP16. However, during consolidation chemotherapy consisting of oral cytarabine ocfosfate and VP16, fever and pericardial effusion developed. In both cases, pericardiocentesis revealed exudative effusion with many neutrophils. Neither bacterial nor fungal infection was demonstrated. Chest symptoms and fever were resolved by methylprednisolone pulse therapy and pericardial drainage. Both patients were given a diagnosis of pericarditis caused by allergic reaction to Ara-C. We also report on 6 other patients with Ara-C syndrome who have been encountered by our hospital.
