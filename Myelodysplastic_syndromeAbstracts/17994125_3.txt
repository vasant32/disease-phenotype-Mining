Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) commonly present with pancytopenia, suggesting that the marrow stroma fails to support the growth of both malignant and normal stem cells. We therefore retrospectively analyzed the duration to engraftment of neutrophils (> or =0.5 x 10(9)/l and > or =1.0 x 10(9)/l) and platelets (> or =20 and > or =50 x 10(9)/l) in 37 MDS patients and 42 patients suffering from primary AML, following allogeneic SCT. A significantly shorter time to engraftment was documented in AML as compared to MDS patients in all four parameters. These results held true even when we subgrouped the patients according to gender, age (50 years being the cutoff age between young and elderly patients), patient-donor relationship, donor match and intensity of conditioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a comparison has been made. We suggest that the longer duration of post transplant pancytopenia that is frequently observed in MDS patients may also influence post transplant outcome.
