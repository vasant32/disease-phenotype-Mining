Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and possible evolution to acute leukaemia. Occurrence of stem cell defects and of immune-mediated mechanisms was evidenced as relevant for pathophysiology of MDS. Here, we described one case of MDS patient carrying CD14(+) CD56(+) monocytes in bone marrow (BM), in presence of a defective HLA-E expression on peripheral blood (PB) cells and of Natural Killer (NK) cell expansion in PB and BM. The defective Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-E expression and the NK expansion are proposed to be relevant for the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia in those patients showing CD14(+) CD56(+) monocytes in BM.
