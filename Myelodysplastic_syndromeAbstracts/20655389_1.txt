Because patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remain in the vicinity of the transplant center for approximately 90 days posttransplantation, identifying prognostic factors to determine those at immediate higher risk of mortality is essential. A normal serum albumin level generally denotes healthiness. We evaluated the prognostic significance of day 90 hypoalbuminemia (and other clinical, pharmacologic, and laboratory variables) in 163 patients, median age 48 years (range, 19-69 years), who underwent allo-HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 124) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 39). Day 90 hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL) was associated with worse nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and poor overall survival (OS). The estimated 1- and 2-year cumulative incidence rates of NRM were 48% and 52%, respectively, and the corresponding OS rates were 7% and 3%. Serum albumin level <3.0 g/dL and Karnofsky score <80 at day 90 were strong independent predictors of worse NRM and OS in multivariate analysis. These results support day 90 hypoalbuminemia as an adverse prognostic marker for NRM and OS after allo-HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
