During a 5 year period, 28 adult patients with megaloblastic anaemia (MA) were treated in University Hospital. 71% of the patients were Indians. Symptoms of anaemia was the main presenting complaint in 18 (64%) of patients while in 2 patients peripheral neuropathy was the main problem. Pancytopenia was a common finding (present in 18 (64%) patients) while 6 (21%) patients had severe thrombocytopenia (less than 20 x 10(9)/L). The peripheral blood morphology provided important diagnostic clues i.e. macrocytes and/or hypersegmented neutrophils seen in most patients. Concurrent iron deficiency 'dampened' the megaloblastic picture. Though most patients suffered from MA of nutritional origin, 3 patients were diagnosed to have pernicious anaemia and 2 patients had myelodysplastic syndrome. Important practice points were detection of concurrent infection and hypokalemia which necessitated appropriate treatment. The controversy of blood transfusion in treatment of MA and the importance of reassessing patients after treatment were highlighted.
