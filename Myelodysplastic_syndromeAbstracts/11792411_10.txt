The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a clinically heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders. Cytogenetic analysis is crucial as it can provide both diagnostic and prognostic information. Herein, 32 cytogenetically normal patients with primary MDS were analyzed both by multiple FISH probes on interphase nuclei (FISH panel testing) and by M-FISH (metaphase nuclei). One patient had a chromosome 13q-arm deletion, while the remaining 31 patients had normal results. These findings confirm standard cytogenetics as an excellent technique in identifying the common chromosomal abnormalities associated with MDS and suggest limited utility for either a FISH panel test or M-FISH in primary MDS.
