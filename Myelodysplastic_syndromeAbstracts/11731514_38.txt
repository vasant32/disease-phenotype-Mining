PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term outcome after allogeneic (allo) and autologous (auto) blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 157 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory HL, who underwent BMT between March 1985 and April 1998. Patients <or= age 55 with HLA-matched siblings were prioritized toward allo BMT. The median age was 28 years (range, 13 to 52 years) for the 53 allo patients and 30.5 years (range, 11 to 62 years) for the 104 auto patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up after BMT for surviving patients was 5.1 years (range, 1 to 13.8 years). For the entire group, the probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) and relapse at 10 years were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 33%) and 58% (95% CI, 48% to 69%), respectively. According to multivariate analysis, disease status before BMT (sensitive relapse if responding to conventional-dose therapy or resistant disease if not) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39, P < .0001) and date of BMT (HR = 0.93, P = .004) were independent predictors of EFS, whereas only disease status (HR = 0.35, P < .0001) influenced relapse. There was a trend for probability of relapse in sensitive patients to be less after allo BMT at 34% (range, 8% to 59%) versus 51% (range, 36% to 67%) for the auto patients (HR = 0.51, P = .17). There was a continuing risk of relapse or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for 12 years after auto BMT, whereas there were no cases of secondary AML/MDS or relapses beyond 3 years after allo BMT. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a clinical graft-versus-HL effect associated with allo BMT. Allo BMT for HL also seems to have a lower risk of secondary AML/MDS than auto BMT. Thus, allo BMT warrants continued study in HL.
