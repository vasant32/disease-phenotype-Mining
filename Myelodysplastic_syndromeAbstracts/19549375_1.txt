The aim of this study was to investigate the difference of Id4 gene promoter methylation in patients with different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). By using MS-PCR method, the methylation status of Id4 gene was detected in 50 patients with different subtypes of MDS. Id4 methylation was also detected in bone marrow samples from patients with iron deficiency anemia which served as control. The results showed that Id4 gene was unmethylated in all of bone marrow samples from controls. In various subtypes of MDS patients, the rate of Id4 gene methylation was different. No Id4 methylation was found in 6 cases of RA, 2 cases of RARS and 4 cases of MDS-U. Id4 methylations was found in 2 out of 18 patients with RCMD. Id4 methylation in 3 out of 12 patients with RAEBI and other 3 out 8 patients with RAEBII were found. In groups with blast ratio lower or higher than 5%, the incidence of Id4 gene methylation were 6.7% and 30% respectively, so that there was significant difference. In tentative conclusion, Id4 gene methylation possibly is found in MDS patients with higher ratio of blast cells.
