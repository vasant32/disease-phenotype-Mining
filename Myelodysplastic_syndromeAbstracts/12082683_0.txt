 PURPOSE: High-dose therapy (HDT) is currently under investigation for patients with advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We report on the toxicity of a modified HDT that combines total-body irradiation (TBI) with involved-field irradiation (IF-RT) for patients with bulky disease or residual lymphomas > 2 cm after induction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 41 patients received HDT which consisted of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fractionated TBI (6 x 2 Gy) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Eleven patients received IF-RT prior to TBI, three patients had already received another radiotherapy treatment prior to HDT. RESULTS: After a medium follow-up of 19 months we observed an overall survival rate of 100%, and a relapse-free survival rate of 78%. Severe toxicity was observed only in one patient who developed a myelodysplastic syndrome, and another patient who showed signs of pneumonitis. About two thirds of the patients claimed minor toxicity of grade I-II according the LENT-SOMA scale, predominantly as a decrease in concentration, reduced sexual functioning, and musculo-skeletal pain. Correspondingly, laboratory tests showed grade I-II changes of blood counts, liver enzymes, hormone levels, and lung function. There was no excess toxicity in the patients who received IF-RT additional to TBI. CONCLUSIONS: HDT including TBI and prior IF-RT is feasible without excess morbidity. Careful follow-up is required to detect myelodysplastic syndrome or endocrine changes of ovarian or testicular function.
