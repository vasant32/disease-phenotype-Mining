Intravenous low-dose 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) yields an approximately 50% overall response rate, including 20-25% complete remission. Decitabine-treated MDS patients can be managed as outpatients after completion of a 3-day infusion schedule. In-hospital nights (IHNs), overall survival (OS), and remaining life spent in hospital were evaluated and compared to a matched control group receiving different standard treatments. Between July 1992 and September 2001, 99 high-risk MDS patients, median age 70 years (range 49-86), were treated with low-dose decitabine. Durations of all hospitalizations were recorded. For matched-pair analysis, 44 decitabine-treated patients were matched to 44 MDS patients according to International Prognostic Scoring System classification, period of diagnosis, age, French-American-British classification, and gender. Median number of IHN across all patients was 56 and survival was 481 days, resulting in 84% of remaining life spent at home. In the matched-pair analysis, the median number of IHN was 57 in the decitabine group vs. 50 in the control group. Median survival was 400 vs. 371 days for the decitabine and control groups, respectively. Median number of remaining life spent at home was identical (83% for both groups). Matched patients who received only best supportive care (n=12) had a shorter median survival than the decitabine patients (234 vs. 400 days), and the proportion of remaining life spent at home was slightly greater (82 vs. 77%). Interestingly, matched patients with induction therapy showed comparable IHN, OS, and remaining life spent at home. In conclusion, high-risk MDS patients treated with low-dose decitabine have better survival, and spend comparable time in hospital than patients treated with supportive treatment.
