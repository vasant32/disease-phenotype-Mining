 PURPOSE: Erythroid apoptosis in low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) maybe mediated via mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation. In the present study, we compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of proerythroid treatment with erythropoietin + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on myelodysplastic erythropoiesis regarding apoptosis and preferential growth of clones with cytogenetic abnormalities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled 15 refractory anemia (RA) and 11 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), including 5q- aberration, monosomy 7, and trisomy 8, before initiation of treatment and followed nine patients after successful treatment. The effects of G-CSF and erythropoietin were assessed. The expression of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) was explored during erythroid maturation. The relative growth of erythroid progenitors with cytogenetic aberrations in presence of erythropoietin was investigated. RESULTS: Significant redistribution of cytochrome c was seen before treatment at all stages of erythroid differentiation. This release was blocked by G-CSF during the whole culture period and by erythropoietin during the latter phase. Both freshly isolated glycophorin A+ bone marrow cells and intermediate erythroblasts during cultivation retained their expression of G-CSFR. Cytochrome c release and caspase activation were significantly less pronounced in progenitors obtained from successfully treated nonanemic patients and showed no further response to G-CSF in vitro. Moreover, erythropoietin significantly promoted growth of cytogenetically normal cells from 5q- patients, whereas no such effect was observed on erythroblasts from monosomy 7 or trisomy 8 patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that growth factors such as erythropoietin and G-CSF can act both via inhibition of apoptosis of myelodysplastic erythroid precursors and via selection of cytogenetically normal progenitors.
