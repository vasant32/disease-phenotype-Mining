A 71-year-old Japanese male with myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to overt leukaemia and hepatocellular carcinoma developed dyspnea and urticaria immediately after infusion of platelet concentrate (PC). He exhibited an identical reaction following blood transfusion. Serum haptoglobin was undetectable. The patient was determined to be homozygous for Hp(del) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibody to haptoglobin was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. No antibodies against human leucocyte antigen (HLA) or platelet-specific antigens were detected. Washed PC and washed red blood cells were effective in preventing the transfusion-related anaphylactoid reactions.
