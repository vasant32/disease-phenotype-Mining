Twenty patients (age range, 4 to 48 years; median age, 36 years) with de novo or drug-induced myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders were treated with myeloablative immunosuppressive therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Four preparative regimens were used; three regimens consisted of combined total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy and one of combination chemotherapy only. One patient received marrow from his identical twin brother, whereas the other 19 patients were grafted with marrow from histocompatible siblings. In 19 patients the abnormal clone was at least temporarily ablated, while in one patient the congenital myelodysplasia persisted. Eight patients are alive and well for +108 to +3,359 days post-transplantation. Nine patients died of transplant-related complications (six of interstitial pneumonia, two of gastrointestinal bleeding, and one of fungal sepsis) and three patients died with persisting or recurring disease. One patient with a late recurrence has undergone a second successful bone marrow transplant procedure. Outcome of BMT was not related to French-American-British (FAB) type, marrow fibrosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, or preparation regimen. Marrow transplantation as a means of providing long-term disease-free survival and possible cure should be considered in patients if a suitable donor is available.
