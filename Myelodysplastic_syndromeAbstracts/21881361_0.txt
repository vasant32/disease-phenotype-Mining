Open heart operations for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are associated with infective and bleeding complications. We report a 67-year-old woman with rheumatic, severe mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis associated with MDS who underwent a mitral valve (MV) repair. Commissurotomy was performed in the anterior commissure. Autologous pericardial patch treated with glutaraldehyde solution was prepared. The anterior leaflet was completely detached from the posterior to the anterior commissure. The anterior leaflet was augmented by autologous pericardial patch treated with glutaraldehyde solution and three pairs of artificial chordae were implanted. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed an increase in the MV orifice and less than trivial mitral regurgitation. Two years after the operation, the patient has normal sinus rhythm with no deterioration of the MV lesion by transthoracic echocardiography. Although the feasibility of MV repair is low in patients with restrictive pathology due to rheumatic disease, MV repair may be preferred in patients with MDS.
