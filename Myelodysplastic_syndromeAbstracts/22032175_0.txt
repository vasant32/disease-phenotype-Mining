Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual stage of Pseudoallescheria boydii, is a fungus ubiquitous in soil as well as organically polluted areas, where nitrogen-containing compounds are abundant. It is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that can range from cutaneous to disseminated infection and can be fatal within months of diagnosis. Here we present a case of disseminated S. apiospermum infection with cutaneous manifestations in a 59-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome, in remission from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, presented with pneumonia and deteriorating mental status. An X-ray computed tomography scan showed three non-contrast-enhancing hypodensities affecting the brain. Many erythematous, indurated skin lesions, measuring 3-5 mm in diameter, were noted on her chest, shoulders and arms. Biopsies were submitted for culture and histology. Histopathologic examination revealed superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Scattered collections of fungal organisms were noted near the eccrine glands. The periodic acid Schiff with diastase stain showed the presence of variable sized spores and hyphae with some acute angle branching. Both tissue and blood cultures were positive for a single Scedosporium species. Histologically, eccrine or peri-eccrine involvement by fungi may be an important finding for Scedosporium infection of the skin.
