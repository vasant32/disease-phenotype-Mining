Myocardial enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), HBD (LDH1 and LDH2), and creatine kinase (CK) and its isoenzyme were monitored in 106 cases of malignant hematologic diseases. The findings were that average values of LDH and HBD increased. There were 82.4% myocardial enzyme levels of 51 patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) returning to normal or making an obvious reduction after chemotherapy associated with drugs of heart toxicity, while there were increases of the myocardial enzyme levels before chemotherapy. Patients with the increasing of enzyme levels were only 3.9% after chemotherapy. After several courses of chemotherapy, the positive rates of the increasings of CK and CK-MB were higher than that of pretreatment. The results suggest that the injuries of myocardium are possible.
