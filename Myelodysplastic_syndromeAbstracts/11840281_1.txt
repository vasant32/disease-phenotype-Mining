We measured plasma nm23-H1 level (nm23-H1), a differentiation inhibitory factor, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The nm23-H1 in AA was not significantly elevated when compared to normal subjects (6.66 +/- 1.20 ng/ml vs 5.13 +/- 0.81 ng/ml; P = 0.274). In contrast, MDS patients had significantly high levels of nm23-H1 compared not only to normal subjects (11.16 +/- 1.42 vs 5.13 +/- 0.81 ng/ml; P = 0.0004) but also to those of the AA group (11.16 +/- 1.42 ng/ml vs 6.66 +/- 1.20 ng/ml; P = 0.018). In the MDS group of patients, no significant difference was observed in the nm23-H1 levels between patients with refractory anemia (RA) and RA with excess blasts (RAEB)/RAEB in transformation (10.71 +/- 1.61 ng/ml vs 9.24 +/- 2.66 ng/ml; P = 0.672). Of the patients with RA, patients with low risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) had significantly low levels of nm23-H1 compared to those of IPSS INT-1 level cases (6.40 +/- 1.36 ng/ml vs 13.05 +/- 2.50 ng/ml; P = 0.0028), suggesting that nm23-H1 may be useful as a prognostic marker for MDS, especially in low risk patients.
