We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes in patients older than 50 years of age who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Twenty-three patients received conventional stem cell transplantation (CST) and 9 patients received reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST). Regimen-related toxicity was observed in 21 (91%) patients with CST and 4 (44%) patients with RIST. Early death occurred within 100 days after transplantation in 6 patients with CST and 2 patients with RIST. Among the patients with complete remission, the two-year probability rate of survival was 44% in patients with CST and 100% in patients with RIST (p=0.08). Among the patients without complete remission, the two-year probability rate of survival was 30% in patients with CST and 0% in those with RIST (p=0.08). For patients receiving RIST without complete remission, relapse and infection were the main causes of death. Our data suggest that patients without complete remission should receive CST to the degree possible.
