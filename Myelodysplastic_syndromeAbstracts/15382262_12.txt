We performed cytogenetic and molecular studies on an adult patient with refractory anemia with an excess of blasts with an add(11)(p15). Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified the extra material on 11p as belonging to chromosome 15. Metaphase FISH with probes for chromosomes 5, 11, and 15 revealed a complex four-break rearrangement. Clone RP5-1173K1, containing exons 10-20 of the NUP98 gene, gave three fluorescence signals on the normal 11, the der(5), and the der(15). 3'-RACE-PCR identified an in-frame fusion between NUP98 and NSD1, which was confirmed by RT-PCR. Two different spliced forms, that is, NUP98 exon 11/NSD1 exon 6 and NUP98 exon 12/NSD1 exon 6, were detected. The reciprocal NSD1/NUP98 was not found. A dual-color experiment with RP5-1173K1 and CTC-549A4, spanning the entire NSD1 gene, indicated an insertion of NUP98 into the NSD1 locus. This is the first report of an adult with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) harboring an NUP98/NSD1 fusion resulting from insertion of 5'-NUP98 into the NSD1/5q35 locus.
