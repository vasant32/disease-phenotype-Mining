Changes of hemostatic markers in 226 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hematopoietic disorders were examined after treatment of DIC. The changes in prothrombin time (PT) ratio, fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), antithrombin, and protein C, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) in all patients with DIC were significant during the clinical course of DIC, but those of D-dimer, thrombomodulin (TM), tissue factor (TF), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were not. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and PT were significantly longer in the poor response group than in good response group. Plasma levels of FDP, TAT, PPIC, SFMC, TM, and DIC score were significantly higher in poor response group than in good response. Protein C and antithrombin levels were significantly lower in poor response group than in good response group. The changes of PT ratio, fibrinogen, FDP, DIC score, antithrombin, plasmin inhibitor, and protein C were significant in the good response group, but these levels were not significant in the poor response group. The changes in plasma TAT and SFMC levels were significant in the good response group but were not in poor response group. The changes in D-dimer, TM, TF, or TFPI were not significant in both groups. These findings suggest that anticoagulant agents should be administered at levels below TAT 40 ng/mL or SFMC 300 microgram/mL in patients with DIC and hematopoietic disorders.
