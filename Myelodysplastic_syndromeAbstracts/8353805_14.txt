We conducted a case control study of 50 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 17 chronic myeloid leukemias (CML), 19 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 246 controls. The cases were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, and chromosome aberrations were recorded according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. Exposure to suspected leukemogenic agents was assessed blindly by an industrial hygienist. Increased risks were noted for mechanics, welders, electricians, and drivers among men and among farmers and textile workers among women. Increased SMRs for leukemias in a census-based cohort study conducted in the same area (Torino) were previously reported for electricians and drivers among men and for textile workers among women. We detected nonstatistically significant increased relative risks for exposure to benzene (odds ratio, OR = 1.7), petrol refining products (1.9), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (1.7), and electromagnetic fields (1.6) in men; in women, a statistically significant association with exposure to pesticides was detected [OR = 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-11.5]. Although exposure to pesticides was confined to AML, MDS cases included a high proportion of subjects exposed to benzene and electromagnetic fields. No particular histologic subtype of AML was associated with chemical exposures except for that of pesticides with the M4 category. Chromosome aberrations were not associated with chemical exposures (OR = 1.0), but a nonstatistically significant excess was noted in association with electromagnetic fields (OR = 2.1).
