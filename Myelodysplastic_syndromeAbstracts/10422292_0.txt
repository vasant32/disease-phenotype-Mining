A 74-year-old woman had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 1986. In June 1994, she suffered exacerbation of pancytopenia with no chromosomal abnormalities, but AML1/EVI1 chimeric mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Two months later, an increase in bone marrow blasts (5%) was noted, and chromosomal analysis detected t(3 ; 21) (q26 ; 22), del(7) (q22), del(11) (q23). In 1995, the marrow blasts increased to 30% and the patient died of disease progression. The AML1/EVI1 gene has been shown to cause blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This case suggested that the AML1/EVI1 gene may be involved in the progression of MDS together with del(7) (q22) and del(11) (q23).
