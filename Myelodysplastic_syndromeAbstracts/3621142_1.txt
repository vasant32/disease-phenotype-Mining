The cell cycle kinetics in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 30 patients with hematologic diseases, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas [10], acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias [10], and myelodysplastic syndromes [10] were studied. Thirty normal healthy subjects formed the control group. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients showed an elongation of the cell cycle time (43% of metaphases in the first cycle), whereas leukemic patients presented a shortening of the cell cycle progression with 46% of cells in the third division. Myelodysplastic syndromes showed most of the metaphases (55%) in the second cycle.
