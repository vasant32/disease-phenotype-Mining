 UNLABELLED: Myelodysplastic syndromes are heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders. Various abnormalities in the immunoregulation system have been reported in patients with MDS. Most of studies were about lymphocytes in peripheral blood. There weren't reports described lymphopoesis in the peripheral blood after reclassification of MDS according WHO. We analyzed retrospectively subopulations of lymphocytes in bone marrow of patients with MDS recognized according to the WHO classification. INVESTIGATED GROUP: There were 58 patients, 24 women and 34 men. We recognized following subtypes of MDS: 5 pts with RA (8.5%), 22-RCMD (38%), 4-RCMD-RS (7%), 14-RAEB1 (24%), 9-RAEB2 (15.5%), 3-MDS-U (5%),1-5q-. METHODS: Cell staining was performed in whole bone marrow during routine phenotyping with using following antibodies: anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD16, anti-CD56, anti-CD19. All of the results have been statistically tested by using t-Student test and Spearmans correlation. RESULTS: There percentage of cells CD3+ was statistically larger, lymphocytes CD19+ statistically smaller, than in healthy in pts with MDS. In analyzed subtypes of MDS: RCMD, RAEB 1 and RAEB2 we detected statistically larger percentage of cells: CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and smaller lymphocytes CD 19+ percentage-than in normal BM. Statistically larger percentage of cells CD3-CD16+CD56+ in subtype RAEB2 than RAEB1 was only one statistically difference between subtypes MDS: RCMD, RAEB1 and RAEB2. Following dependencies were found out in correlation's study: negative correlation between percentage of whole lymphocytes and celullarity of BM, percentage of lymphocytes, CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+ cells and quantative of granulopoesis; positive correlation between percentage of CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells and changes in intensification of granulopoesis and percentage of CD3+CD8+ and quantitative of dyserythropoesis and changes in intensification megakariopoesis. SUMMARY: Our studies show differences in percentage of whole lymphocytes in whole population of pts with MDS and supopulations: RCMD, RAEB1 and RAEB2 in comparison to healthy donors. We showed relationship between: percentage of lymphocytes CD3+ and changes of intensification granulopoesis, CD3+CD8+ cells and dyserythropoesis and megakariopoesis. Detected differences between subtypes RAEB1 and RAEB2 in precemtage cells CD3CD16+CD56+ verified changes between these 2 new isolated by WHO subtypes of MDS.
