Vasculitis may accompany neoplasias and be of paraneoplastic type or associated with drugs used in patient treatment. We evaluated skin biopsies of twenty-eight cases with vasculitis accompanying leukemias reviewed and clinical outcome was evaluated. Eleven of the 28 cases had paraneoplastic vasculitis and 17 had vasculitis associated with various drugs including chemotherapy, cytokines and antibacterial agents. Paraneoplastic vasculitis was seen in 3 cases with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic phase, 5 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, and 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs responsible for the 17 cases of vasculitis included hydroxyurea, vincristine, cytosine-arabinoside, methotrexate, all-trans retinoic acid, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon and antibiotics. Paraneoplastic vasculitis is not rare in leukemias and may be a manifestation of the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. Furthermore paraneoplastic vasculitis can be fatal in myelodysplastic syndromes and may be present clinically before the specific diagnosis is made. Drugs used in routine therapy may be the cause of the vasculitis, thus skin biopsy should be performed in all cutaneous lesions in patients with hemopoietic neoplasias.
