A 58-year-old female was diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB)]. Although melphalan was administered, no response was obtained in the peripheral blood. Sixteen months after diagnosis, she developed RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and then overt leukemia. White blood cell (WBC) count elevated to 28,600/microliters with 34% of blasts. She was administered cytarabine ocfosfate (200 mg-->300 mg/day) orally, resulting in decrease of WBC count and blasts in peripheral blood. The drug has been given for 11 months, and her hematological data have now remained stable in RAEB. Cytarabine ocfosfate might be a useful drug for the treatment of high risk MDS such as RAEB and RAEB-t.
