A case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia with a new translocation, t(2;7)(p13;q36), as the sole karyotypic abnormality is reported. The patient's leukemia evolved from a cytogenetically normal myelodysplastic syndrome of 4 years' duration. Following treatment the patient entered complete remission with loss of the cytogenetically abnormal clone. Subsequent bone marrow analyses showed recurrence of the myelodysplastic syndrome with a normal karyotype. Although both chromosomes 2 and 7 are known to be involved in nonrandom karyotypic changes in human cancer and leukemia, t(2;7)(p13;q36) has not been reported previously.
