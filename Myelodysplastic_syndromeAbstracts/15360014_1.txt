Granulocytic sarcomas are extramedullary tumors (EMD) of malignant myeloid precursor cells. EMD or granulocytic sarcoma of ovary is rare disease. A 15-year-old girl had complaints of abdominal pain and weight loss for 3 months. On physical examination, there were hepatosplenomegaly and a painless mass under the umbilicus. Breast development was grade II. There was no clitoris hypertrophy. Her labia majora were separate and vagina hypoplastic. Hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, white blood cells count 2.8 x 10(6)/1, platelet count 31.6 x 10(9)/1. There were dysplastic features in the blood and bone marrow cells. There were 10 and 22% blasts in the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, respectively. The levels of serum follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormones were high. An inguinal mass (diameter 9.5 x 7.6) cm was detected on computed tomography. The histopathological diagnosis of this was obtained from laporascopy was composed of ovotestis and there was marked blastic infiltration in this ovotestis which had myeloid markers on flow cytometry. In the immunohistochemical analyses of ovotestis and bone marrow, blasts were positive for LCA, CD-13, CD-33 and CD 68. The cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow shaved 46 XY karyotype. No response was achieved with combination chemotherapy and the patient died from progressive leukemia. Here we report a rare patient with myelodysplastic syndrome, EMD and hermaphroditism. To our knowledge this is the first case of MDS, EMD and hermaphroditism.
