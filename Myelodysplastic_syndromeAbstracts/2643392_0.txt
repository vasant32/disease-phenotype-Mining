A total of 165 patients were entered into this study and 140 were evaluate for effects and 165 for toxicities. Of 39 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 21 achieved complete remission (CR), 6 achieved partial remission (PR) with a response rate of 69.2%. In MDS, of 11 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), one good partial response and 4 partial response were observed (CR + PR:45.5%); of 14 patients with RAEB, one complete response, 4 partial response (CR + PR: 35.7%); of 11 patients with RAEB in T, 3 partial response were observed (response rate: 27.3%). Of 13 patients with polycythemia vera, 4 excellent effect and 7 moderate effect (84.6%) were observed. Seven of 30 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia achieved partial response (23.3%). Mean dosages of SM-108 until remission were 400-500 mg/m2/day on CMMoL, RAEB in MDS, polycythemia vera and CML, and 600-800 mg/m2/day on RAEB in T and AML. In the analysis of adverse effects of SM-108, a subjective side effects including mainly gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in 38 cases (23.0%) of the patients : 26 patients (15.8%) showed objective side effects including liver dysfunction, but these symptoms were transient and not serious. Our study indicates that SM-108 is useful agent against MDS, especially CMMoL, RAEB, RAEB in T, polycythemia vera and CML.
