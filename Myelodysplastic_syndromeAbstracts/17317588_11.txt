Marrow fibrosis is considered a poor prognostic factor in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The affect of fibrosis on outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with MDS has not been examined. We performed a retrospective analysis in 471 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia arising from MDS, 113 with and 358 without marrow fibrosis, who received myeloablative allogeneic HCT. Post-HCT follow-up was 0.3-10 years (median, 3.6 years) for patients with, and 0.6-12 years (median, 5 years) for patients without fibrosis. Engraftment was significantly delayed in patients with fibrosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.4; P < .001). Overall, there were no significant differences in overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) between patients with and without fibrosis. However, among patients with advanced disease (int-2 or high-risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System), OS (P = .03), RFS (P = .04), and NRM (P = .04) were inferior when marrow fibrosis was present. Given that marrow fibrosis is a poor prognostic factor for patients with MDS, and that it does not appear to affect outcome of transplantation in patients with earlier-stage disease but has a negative impact on outcome for patients with advanced disease, patients with earlier-stage MDS and marrow fibrosis might be considered for HCT earlier than their disease stage would normally dictate.
