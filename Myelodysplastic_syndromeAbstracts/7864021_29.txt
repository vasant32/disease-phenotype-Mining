Despite hypercellular bone marrows (BM), peripheral cytopenias are the rule in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This study examined the roles played by cell birth and cell death rates in generating this paradox. Cell kinetics from BM biopsies of 35 MDS patients were measured using intravenous infusions of either iododeoxyuridine or bromodeoxyuridine, or both. Degree of apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) was estimated using in situ end-labeling of DNA directly from BM biopsies, which were simultaneously double-labeled from proliferation/PCD. MDS were found to be highly proliferative disorders with large numbers of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells synthesizing DNA. Median cycling time (Tc) of myeloblasts was more rapid than that of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (44.1 hr vs. 56.0 hr). Interestingly, most marrow cells of all three lineages in 32 of 34 evaluable cases were undergoing PCD. In 19 of 32 patients, greater than 75% cells were apoptotic. Surprisingly, large numbers of S-phase cells were found to be simultaneously undergoing PCD, as were stromal cells of the BM microenvironment. We conclude that the extensive apoptosis in hematopoietic cells effectively cancels the high birth rate resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis and accounting for deficient bone marrow function.
