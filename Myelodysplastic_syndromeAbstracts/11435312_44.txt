Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a slowly progressing hematologic malignancy associated with a poor outcome. Despite the relatively high incidence of MDS in the elderly, differentiation of MDS from de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still remains problematic. Identification of genes expressed in an MDS-specific manner would allow the molecular diagnosis of MDS. Toward this goal, AC133 surface marker-positive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like fractions have been collected from a variety of leukemias in a large-scale and long-term genomics project, referred to as "Blast Bank," and transcriptome of these purified blasts from the patients with MDS were then compared with those from AML through the use of oligonucleotide microarrays. A number of genes were shown to be expressed in a disease-specific manner either to MDS or AML. Among the former found was the gene encoding the protein Delta-like (Dlk) that is distantly related to the Delta-Notch family of signaling proteins. Because overexpression of Dlk may play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS, the disease specificity of Dlk expression was tested by a quantitative "real-time" polymerase chain reaction analysis. Examination of the Blast Bank samples from 22 patients with MDS, 31 with AML, and 8 with chronic myeloid leukemia confirmed the highly selective expression of the Dlk gene in the individuals with MDS. Dlk could be the first candidate molecule to differentiate MDS from AML. The proposal is made that microarray analysis with the Blast Bank samples is an efficient approach to extract transcriptome data of clinical relevance for a wide range of hematologic disorders.
