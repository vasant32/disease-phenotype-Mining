Fourty two children with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated in seven centres of The Polish Paediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group in period 1975-1998 were included in the study. In 16 children RAEB-T, in 3 CMML, in 10 RA and in 13 RAEB were diagnosed. BMT is the best therapy for children with MDS. For children, who have not a donor for BMT, Roacutan therapy seems to be the most effective.
