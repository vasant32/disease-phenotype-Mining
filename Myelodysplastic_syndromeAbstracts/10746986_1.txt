We describe the simultaneous presentation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Our patient had MDS (RAEB type) and bone marrow infiltration (40% plasma cells), as well as biclonal paraprotein. Patients with MM, MDS have been reported after chemotherapy but few cases documenting the coexistence of MDS and MM at diagnosis have been reported in the literature.
