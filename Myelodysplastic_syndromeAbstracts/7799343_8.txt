OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rheumatic complications in patients with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with a rheumatic disease and either a myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorder diagnosed on bone marrow examination. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified, 5 with myelodysplastic and 4 with myeloproliferative disorders. Polyarthritis was the most common rheumatic presentation, occurring in 6 patients with a positive rheumatoid factor in 4. Necrotizing vasculitis complicated the course in 3 patients. Autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia were present in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: There is an association between hematologic disorders caused by proliferation of bone marrow derived pluripotent stem cells and rheumatic disorders.
