The bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) labelling of bone marrow cells was studied in 46 subjects. The labelling in 14 patients, mostly untreated, with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and four lymphoma patients was significantly (p = 0.043) higher (11.38 +/- SE 2.3% S-phase cells) than that of marrow cells (7.18 +/- SE 1.04%) from 14 apparently healthy normal controls and from nine patients with non hematologic disease. Six iron deficiency had numerically but not significantly increased values. Bone marrow samples from MDS-patients showing the highest numbers of cells in the DNA-synthesis phase had the lowest numbers of colonies and clusters in the CFU-C assay (p < 0.03). The data suggest that the DNA-synthesis period is longer in MDS than in controls.
