 OBJECTIVE: The relationship between patient characteristics and posaconazole exposures was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model using trial data from neutropenic patients administered oral posaconazole suspension as antifungal prophylaxis. METHODS: Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Covariates were tested using the forward addition, Objective Function (OF) cut-off of 3.84, followed by the backward elimination (OF cut-off 10.88) steps in NONMEM. These covariates included demographics, mucositis, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H(2)-receptor antagonist usage and baseline bilirubin or baseline gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels > or =2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A correlation between posaconazole PK and the occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFI) was also examined. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were demonstrated between posaconazole PK and diarrhea, PPI intake, race, and baseline GGT and bilirubin levels. These covariates did not predominate in patients who developed IFI. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides information regarding the correlation of patient covariates with posaconazole exposures estimated in a clinical setting. The results of this analysis agree with previously reported analyses. However, because of the successful prophylaxis and the low number of posaconazole-treated patients with IFI proven or probable (IFIPP), the absence of a statistically significant relationship between IFIPP and exposure may not mean this relationship does not exist. A meta-analysis of several efficacy trials or exploring alternate composite endpoints for efficacy may be needed to answer this question.
