Objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of autologous cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells combined with IL-2 in treatment of elderly patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 6 elderly MDS patients and were stimulated by cytokines in vitro to form CIK cells. The autologous CIK cells were then infused back into the corresponding patients. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks. Effector cell proportion changes, adverse effects, effects on inflammation, hemoglobin level and blood transfusion were assessed after treatment. The results showed that after autologous CIK cell infusion, the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD56(+) increased significantly (p < 0.05). No severe adverse effects were observed in all patients. It also significantly reduced inflammation frequency and shortened high fever duration. During stable stage of disease, the CIK cell infusion could reduce the red blood cell infusion amount and stabilize hemoglobin level. However, the natural course of transformation from myelodysplastic syndromes to high-risk subtypes could not be changed by CIK cell treatment. It is concluded that the autologous CIK cell infusion is a safe and effective therapy for geriatric myelodysplastic syndrome.
