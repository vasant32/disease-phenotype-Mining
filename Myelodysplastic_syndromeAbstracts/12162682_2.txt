Sodium valproate is widely prescribed for patients with epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Hematologic toxic effects have been largely described in pediatric patients, and dysmyelopoiesis is reported rarely. We describe 2 elderly patients with valproate-associated dysmyelopoiesis and postulate that this particular side effect may be much more common than currently recognized. A correct diagnosis is important for acute patient anagement and for prognostication.
