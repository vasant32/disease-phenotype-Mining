Dlk1 (Pref-1) is a transmembrane and secreted protein, which is a member of the epidermal growth factor-like family, homologous to Notch/Delta/Serrate. We have found by real-time RT-PCR that Dlk1 mRNA levels were high in CD34(+) cells in 10 of 12 MDS samples compared with CD34(+) cells from 11 normals. Also, Dlk1 mRNA was elevated in mononuclear, low density bone marrow cells from 11/38 MDS patients, 5/11 AML M6 and 2/4 AML M7 samples. Furthermore, 5/6 erythroleukemia and 2/2 megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines highly expressed Dlk1 mRNA. Levels of Dlk1 mRNA markedly increased during megakaryocytic differentiation of both CMK megakaryoblasts as well as normal CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. High serum levels of Dlk1 occurred in RA (4/10) and essential thrombocythemia (2/10) patients. Functional studies showed that forced expression of Dlk1 enhanced proliferation of K562 cells growing in 1% fetal bovine serum. Analysis of hematopoiesis of Dlk1 knockout mice suggested that Dlk1 contributed to granulocyte, megakaryocyte and B-cell clonogenic growth and was needed for generation of splenic B-cells. In summary, Dlk1 is overexpressed in selected samples of MDS (especially RA and RAEB) and AML (particularly M6, M7), and it appears to be associated with normal development of megakaryocytes and B cells.
