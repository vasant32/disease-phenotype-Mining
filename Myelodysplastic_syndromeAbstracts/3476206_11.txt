Recently, a novel approach has been used in the treatment of leukemia: induction of the leukemic cells to undergo terminal differentiation. Based on its in vitro ability to induce differentiation in several myeloid leukemic cell lines, retinoic acid (RA) has been applied clinically in cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid and promyelocytic leukemia. In the present study we have determined in detail the ability of RA to induce expression of granulocytic functions in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) and compared it with that of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Several granulocytic characteristics (phagocytosis, surface adherence and generation of free radicals in response to phorbol-ester) were induced to the same degree by both agents. Other normal neutrophil functions, including lysozyme accumulation, spontaneous migration, chemotactic activity toward zymosan-activated serum (containing C5a), the peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and spontaneous motility in semi-solid medium were induced by DMSO, but they were absent or incompletely expressed in RA-induced cells. In contrast, only RA induced migration toward leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Simultaneous treatment with RA and DMSO proved synergistic with respect to morphological maturation and several functions (e.g. NBT reduction), but complementary stimulation of other activities (e.g. chemotaxis, lysozyme content) could not be demonstrated. Furthermore, characteristics induced by DMSO (i.e., expression of C5a and FMLP receptors and accumulation of lysozyme) were inhibited by the addition of RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
