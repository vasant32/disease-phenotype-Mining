OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the influence of myelodysplastic syndromee (MDS) on the course of pregnancy and delivery. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Gynecological and Obstetric Department 1st Medical Faculty Charles University and General Faculty Hospital, Prague. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The authors analyze their experience with the course of pregnancy and delivery in a patient with MDS and refractory anaemia who was treated on account of the disease for several years before pregnancy in the Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion. Pregnancy was not associated with progression of the basic disease and complications which developed during pregnancy were not associated with MDS. Pregnancy was terminated in this patient on account of preeclampsia gravis per sectionem caesarean by delivery of a healthy foetus. CONCLUSION: The example draws attention to a serious haematological disease while during pregnancy and delivery deterioration of the basic disease was not observed.
