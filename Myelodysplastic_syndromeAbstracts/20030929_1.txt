The aim of this study was to gain more insight into the understanding of myelodysplastic syndrome in the clinical and laboratory features. The clinical data of 65 patients with MDS were reviewed and analysed. According to FAB criteria, 65 patients were classified as follows: 27 patients with RA, 1 patient with RAS, 33 patients with RAEB, 3 patients with RAEB-T, and 1 patient with CMML. The median age of them was 66 years old (range 19-89 years), and 6 patients had a history of toxic exposure (secondary MDS). The bone marrow smears, bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic examinations were performed in this study. The results showed that dysplasia was found in 64 patients examined with bone marrow smears (98.5%), among them trilineage dysplasia in 21 patients (32.3%), bilineage dysplasia in 33 patients (50.8%), only erythroid dysplasia in 8 cases (12.3%) and 2 patients (3.1%) only with myeloid dysplasia. The bone marrow biopsy was performed in 38 patients, abnormal localization of immature precursor (ALIP) occurred in 6 cases. 29 patients had abnormal karyotypes, accounting for 59.2% of the 49 patients subjected cytogenetic examination. The abnormal chromosome was the major cytogenetic abnormality, which occurred more often in secondary MDS and the patients with RAEB or RAEB-T. Among the 49 patients who had received cytogenetic examination, 15 patients transformed into AML with the incidence of 30.61%, but only 3 out of 20 patients in the group of normal chromosome transformed into AML (15%), while 12 out of 29 patients in the group of abnormal karyotypes transformed into AML (41.4%). The median time of following up was 35 months (range 2 - 106 months). The median survival time was 26.8 months and 8 months in the patients with normal karyotype and chromosome aberrations respectively. In conclusion, the incidence of MDS in our country is younger than that in Western countries, the rate of abnormal chromosome in high risk MDS is higher than that in low risk MDS. Meanwhile, those who have the change of chromosome are related to the transformation of MDS into AML and have shorter survival time than those MDS patients with normal karyotypes.
