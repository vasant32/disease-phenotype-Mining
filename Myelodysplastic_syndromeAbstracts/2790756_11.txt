The cytological and cytogenetic features of six patients with myeloid neoplasia and t(6;9)(p23;q34) including a case of acute myelofibrosis (AMF), a refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), and four cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) are described. Two patients in this series, both affected by ANLL type M2, presented an increase of bone marrow basophils, suggesting that this cytological-cytogenetic association is not absolute and that it may be more frequently observed in ANLL with maturation. All patients with de novo ANLL showed associated myelodysplastic features, and one patient presented a dysmyelopoietic syndrome, later evolving into ANLL. The presence of the t(6;9) in a range of myeloid neoplasias, with either concurrent myelodysplastic features or a preleukemic phase in cases of ANLL, provide evidence that this chromosome aberration may always involve a multipotent myeloid stem cell. Data on toxic exposure of the patients suggests that myeloproliferative disorders with the t(6;9) may frequently represent environmentally induced neoplasias.
