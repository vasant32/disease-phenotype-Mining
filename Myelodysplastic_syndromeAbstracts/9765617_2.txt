The WT1 tumor suppressor gene was examined for mutations in a panel of 44 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) secondary to MDS, using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and sequencing analysis. A WT1 mutation was detected in one out of 17 cases of AML secondary to MDS. This mutation exists upstream of the zinc finger region and is predicted to produce a truncated WT1 protein lacking the zinc finger region. No mutations were detected in 27 MDS patients who had not progressed to AML. This is the first report of analysis for WT1 mutations in a large number of MDS patients, suggesting that WT1 mutations are uncommon in MDS. Abnormalities in this gene may, however, contribute to a small proportion of cases showing progression from MDS into AML.
