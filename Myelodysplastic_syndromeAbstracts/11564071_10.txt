Seven adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were treated with total body irradiation (TBI), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and cyclophosphamide (CY), followed by unrelated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched cord blood transplantation (CBT). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was infused continuously from 12 h before until the end of Ara-C therapy to enhance the antileukaemia effect of Ara-C. Five patients are alive and free of disease at 7-31 months after transplantation. These preliminary results suggest that adult MDS-related secondary AML patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.
