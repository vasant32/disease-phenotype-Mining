In the present study we carried out allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 14 leukemia children with high risk prognostic factors. Six patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), four with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), two with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and two with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Among these patients, six with ANLL, two with ALL, one with CML and one with MDS were alive in complete remission 8 to 58 months post-BMT. Four patients died of relapse (one with ALL, and one with MDS), and chronic GVHD (one with ALL and one with CML). In six patients recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rG-CSF) was used to shorten the period of granulocytopenia. The mean time of recovery to granulocyte count of 500/mm3 was 13.2 days in the rG-CSF+ group, being 15.9 days faster than that in the rG-CSF- group. In light of these results, allogeneic BMT is shown to be a choice of treatment for leukemia children with high risk prognostic factors and rG-CSF may be an effective reagent to prevent infectious episodes in BMT.
