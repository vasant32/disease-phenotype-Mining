An 80-year-old man with MDS-refractory anemia (RA) suffered transformation to a leukemic state after 18 months. The karyotype of the bone marrow cells was 47, XY, +8 in 8 cells among 20 dividing cells analyzed. Combination therapy of 150 micrograms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 250 mg of cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC) for 3 weeks had no beneficial effect. Then, the patient was subjected to low-dose (2 mg daily) melphalan therapy. Gradual and concurrent improvement in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia occurred, and the patient became free of transfusions at 2 weeks after the treatment began. Since then, his performance status has improved from grade 4 on his diagnosis of AML to grade 2. Cytogenetic analysis was normal in all 20 dividing cells in the bone marrow examination and melphalan had no adverse effect. Recently, several reports of low dose chemotherapy for elderly patients or high risk leukemia have been described, and have sustained for the QOL therapy. In the present case, low-dose melphalan therapy was effective and, moreover the abnormal karyotype of trisomy eight had disappeared.
