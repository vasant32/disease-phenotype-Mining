Serum beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) was measured on 182 samples from 98 patients with diseases characterized by proliferation of predominantly non-lymphoid marrow elements. Raised levels were found in myeloproliferative disorders, chronic granulocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and in many patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The most striking elevation was seen in acute and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. These raised serum levels are probably derived from increased cell turnover, and it is suggested that cells of monocyte-macrophage series are particularly high producers of beta 2-m.
