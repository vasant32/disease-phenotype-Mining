Adenovirus (AdV) infections are prevalent in bone marrow transplant patients, usually associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a major complication mainly attributed to this virus. The authors report a case of AdV HC in a myelodysplastic patient undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive urine AdV antigen using indirect immunofluorescence assay. The patient gradually improved after adequate hydration, supportive treatment and reduced dose of cyclosporine, and was discharged on the ninth day of hospitalization. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of AdV HC in stem cell transplantation in Southeast Asia.
