Data regarding flow cytometry (FC) in nonacute myeloid disorders is confounded by variable gating strategies and controls limited to normal bone marrow (BM) samples. Blasts in diagnostic BM samples of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMMLs) were compared with 20 nonneoplastic cytopenias/cytoses (CCs) and negative staging BM samples using 4-color FC. Blasts in 10 of 20 CCs showed immunophenotypic differences vs control samples. Immunophenotypic alterations were identified in 18 of 21 MDSs, 11 of 14 MPNs, and 7 of 7 CMMLs vs control samples and 13 (62%) of 21 MDSs, 7 (50%) of 14 MPNs, and 3 (43%) of 7 CMMLs vs CCs. Neoplastic-specific blast immunophenotypic changes included expression of CD7, CD11b, CD15, CD36, and CD56; CD34 overexpression; HLA-DR variability; lack of CD13 and CD33; underexpression of CD13, CD33, CD45, and HLA-DR; and partial loss of CD13, CD33, CD38, and CD117. In all cases, blasts were CD34+. Several blast immunophenotypic alterations are shared in neoplastic and nonneoplastic BM samples. Approximately 40% to 60% of neoplastic BM samples exhibited aberrancies not seen in reactive BM samples.
