OBJECTIVE: To investigate expression of Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1 genes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and its role in pathogenesis of MDS. METHODS: Expression of Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1 genes was examined in 31 MDS, 11 post MDS acute myeloid leukemia (post MDS AML) and 34 de novo AML patients by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Evi1 expression was not detected in 8 normal controls, but low MDS1-Evi1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi1/GAPDH < 0.1) detected in 3 of the 8 controls. Evi1 mRNA was expressed in 1 of 8 RA, 8 of 13 RAEB and 6 of 9 RAEB-t patients, and the percentage of Evi1 expression in RAEB(t) patients was higher than that in RA(P < 0.05). MDS1-Evi1 expression was detected in 5 of 8 RA, 9 of 13 RAEB and 5 of 9 RAEB-t patients, and MDS1-Evi1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi1/GAPDH > 0.1) in the patients were markedly higher than those in the controls. Evi1 expression was gradually increased in 4 of 5 RAEB-t patients with transformation from MDS to AML. The percentages of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi1 expression in post MDS AML patients were higher than those in de novo AML (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The numbers of colony formation of progenitor cells in Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1-positive MDS patients were decreased as compared with Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of Evi1 and overexpression of MDS1-Evi1 might play a certain role in the pathogenesis or progression of MDS and post MDS AML.
