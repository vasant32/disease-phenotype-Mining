We report a patient with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph +ve) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), treated with hydroxyurea alone, who upon disease progression developed an additional Ph - ve clone containing chromosomal abnormalities typical of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Retrospective analysis of a cryopreserved stem cell specimen from diagnosis confirmed that this second clone developed during the course of treatment. The development of a clone with additional cytogenetic abnormalities in CML has only been reported after leukemogenic treatment, stem cell transplantation or interferon. We report a case of secondary Ph - ve MDS/AML during blast crisis in a patient treated with hydroxyurea for CML.
