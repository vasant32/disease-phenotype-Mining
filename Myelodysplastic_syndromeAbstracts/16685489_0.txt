 BACKGROUND: Leukemias are a challenge and a cost factor to society because of their frequency in all age groups. They also serve as a model for a variety of diseases and possess exemplary relevance for basic research and patient care. Leukemia research and therapy have achieved high standards and even a leading position in Germany with regard to clinical trials, standardization of diagnostics and molecular studies of prognostic factors, signal transduction and gene expression. Progress is hampered, however, by fragmentation of leukemia trial groups, diagnostic approaches and treatment research activities. GOALS: A network was therefore created to integrate the leading leukemia trial groups on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) and their interdisciplinary partners (diagnostics, treatment research, biometry) in cooperation with basic research and pharmaceutical industry to foster advancements in leukemiarelated research and health care through clinical trials, promotion of translational research, introduction of standards for diagnostics and therapy, and development of evidence-based guidelines. ACHIEVEMENTS: Achievements include establishment of central information, communication and management structures, creation of an AML intergroup comprising five study groups, formation of an MDS study group and establishment of platforms for diagnostics, genomics and proteomics, and medical informatics. Exchange of scientific progress is mediated by intra- and internet, biannual newsletters, regular project group meetings, and annual network symposia. PERSPECTIVES: On the basis of experience with the Competence Network "Acute and chronic leukemias" with its management, communication and information structures, the "European LeukemiaNet" (ELN) has been established within the 6th Framework Program of the European Union. The ELN integrates 78 leading leukemia trial groups (AML, ALL, CML, CLL, MDS, and CMPD), their 83 interdisciplinary partner groups (diagnostics, treatment research, registry, guidelines), industry and SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) across Europe to form a cooperative network for advancements in leukemia-related research and health care.
