We report the results of unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) for 13 adult patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The median age was 40 years, the median weight was 51 kg, and the median number of infused nucleated cells was 2.43 x 107/kg. Twelve patients had myeloid reconstitution, and the median time to more than 0.5 x 109/L (5 x 108/L) absolute neutrophil count was 22.5 days. A self-sustained platelet count more than 50 x 109/L was achieved in 11 patients at a median time of 49 days. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurred in 9 of 12 evaluable patients and chronic GVHD in 8 of 11 evaluable patients. Ten patients are alive and free of disease at between 171 and 1558 days after transplantation. The probability of disease-free survival at 2 years was 76.2%. These results suggest that adult advanced MDS patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.
