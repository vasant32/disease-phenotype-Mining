We report the case of a 59-year-old woman treated for a refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis during induction therapy combining fludarabine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone. CMV infection occurred rarely during cytarabine and anthracyclin based induction therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or RAEB. CMV infection is usually observed in immunocompromised patients but some cases have been recently observed in patients after autologous stem-cell transplantation with or without CD34 + stem-cell selection. We discuss this case and issues arising from it in relation to the use of combination of high-dose cytarabine and fludarabine.
