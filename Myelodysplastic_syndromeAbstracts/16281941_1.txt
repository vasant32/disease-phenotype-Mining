The minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) and Cdc6 proteins are important regulators of eucaryotic DNA replication. In most normal tissues, a similar proportion of cells express Mcm-2 and Ki-67. The present study showed that in both normal and abnormal states, the proportion of megakaryocytes expressing Mcm-2 is roughly seven times as many as those that express Ki-67. This is likely to be related to the process of endomitosis and endoreduplication. We also demonstrated that a significantly lower proportion of megakaryocytes in myelodysplastic syndrome express Mcm-2. These findings provide new insights into megakaryocyte biology.
