Here we report two patients with hematological malignancies associated with complications of fatal cardiac zygomycosis. The first case, a 72-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome being treated with low-dose cytarabine, died of sudden cardiac arrest. An autopsy revealed disseminated zygomycosis accompanied with occlusion of the coronary artery by fungal thrombi. The second case, a 52-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, developed febrile neutropenia and skin eruptions with induration on the face and extremities during the first induction chemotherapy. She experienced sudden bradycardia with unstable hemodynamics and died of acute myocardial infarction. Histological examination of a skin biopsy demonstrated zygomycosis. In light of the above, it should be kept in mind that cardiac zygomycosis might occur in hematologically compromised patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.
