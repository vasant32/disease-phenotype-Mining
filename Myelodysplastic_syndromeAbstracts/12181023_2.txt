Recent studies have shown a good response to immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA) in patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We have treated six transfusion-dependent MDS patients with CSA for a minimum of 3 months. None of these patients showed a significant response, while the drug was withdrawn in 3/6 patients because of intolerable side-effects. Two reasons for the failure of this treatment in our patients can be advanced. Firstly, the hypoplastic variant of MDS predominated in previous studies in contrast to ours. Secondly, the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive agents in previous studies might have enhanced the effect of CSA. We suggest further therapeutic trials of CSA in MDS, selecting patients on the basis of in vitro studies that predict an immunological basis for their disease, to assess its efficacy in prolonging survival.
