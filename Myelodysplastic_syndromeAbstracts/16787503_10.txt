The incidence of FLT3 mutations (internal tandem duplication and Asp835) was investigated in bone marrow samples from 97 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome [(MDS); excluding cases with refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation] at the time of diagnosis and several time points thereafter. Three patients had FLT3 mutations at presentation. Forty-two patients progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), including the three patients with FLT3 mutations at MDS diagnosis. Three additional patients acquired FLT3 mutations and progressed to AML in 1 month. FLT3 mutations seem to be a critical additional genetic event that transforms a minority of MDS patients to AML.
