A five-year-old boy initially diagnosed common ALL was developed to acute myelomonocytic leukemia. At onset, the bone marrow was hypercellular and 77% of the cells were blasts, mainly lymphoblast-like cells and cytogenetic study demonstrated 45, XY, -7 in all blasts. Cytochemically most of those blasts were negative for peroxidase, sudan black B, alpha-NB esterase staining. The immunological phenotype was J5 (CD10)+, I2 (HLA-DR)+, SmIg-, CyIgmu-, Leu1 (CD5)-, OKT11 (CD2)-, MY7 (CD13)-, suggesting common ALL. Eight months later, the bone marrow cells were occupied with large sized blasts which were almost positive for peroxidase stain and the cells showed coexpression of Mo1 (CD11b)+, MY4 (CD14)+, MY7+, MY9 (CD33)+, MCS2 (CD13)+, I2+, J5-, B4 (CD19)-, Mo2 (CDw14)-, at relapse. He died 2 years and 6 months after his initial diagnosis. An autopsy was performed which revealed generalized infiltration of leukemic cells and aspergillosis of the lung. In general, monosomy 7 is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome in childhood, and is terminated to acute myeloblastic leukemia. In this case, bone marrow blasts demonstrated monosomy 7 cytogenetically, and this case was considered as an acute mixed lineage leukemia of bilineal type. And this case proved that a monosomy 7 can also be terminated to acute mixed lineage leukemia with both lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes.
