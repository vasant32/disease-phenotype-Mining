Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis, which may be associated with systemic conditions such as hematologic disorders. We present a patient who had been diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome associated with PG at onset, in whom a febrile ulcerative skin lesion developed following cytosine arabinoside, aclarubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) combination chemotherapy in the course of the disease. Skin biopsy revealed dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis with central epidermal ulceration, consistent with the diagnosis of PG. Oral prednisolone was effective for the skin lesion. In this case, G-CSF application may participate in the recurrence of PG.
