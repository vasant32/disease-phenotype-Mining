 PURPOSE: Epigenetic silencing via aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation of normal genes has been described as a leukemogenic mechanism in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). We hypothesized that MG98, an oligonucleotide antisense to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), could reverse malignant phenotypes by down-regulating DNMT1 and inducing reexpression of hypermethylated genes. This phase I study was conducted to determine a biologically effective dose and describe the safety of MG98 in MDS/AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three patients with MDS (n = 11) and AML (n = 12) were enrolled. Biologically effective dose was defined as the dose at which > or =50% of patients experienced >50% reduction in DNMT1 expression with acceptable toxicity. Escalating doses of MG98 were administered according to two schedules (2-hour i.v. bolus followed by 5-day continuous i.v. infusion every 14 days, or 14-day continuous i.v. infusion every 21 days). RESULTS: DNMT1 down-regulation was observed in 8 patients. However, biologically effective dose was not reached. Reexpression of target genes (P15, WIT1, and ER) was observed in 12 patients but did not correlate with DNMT1 down-regulation. Escalation was stopped due to dose-limiting toxicities (bone pain, nausea, and fever). No objective clinical response was observed. Disease stabilization occurred in 6 (26%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: No pharmacodynamic or clinical activity was observed at MG98 doses and schedules administered. Despite this, pursuing DNMT1 down-regulation remains a sound approach for targeting aberrant epigenetics in AML/MDS. Future studies with different formulation and/or doses and schedules will be required to ensure efficient MG98 intracellular uptake and fully evaluate its therapeutic potential.
