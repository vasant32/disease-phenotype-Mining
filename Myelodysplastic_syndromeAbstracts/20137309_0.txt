 OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of Cysleine-rich 61(Cyr61) gene in the different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and the significance of Cyr61 in the genesis progression, and transformation of MDS and the relationship between Cyr61 and vascular endothelial grown factor (VEGF). METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical S-P were used to detect mRNA and protein expressions of Cyr61 and VEGF in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from 28 MDS, 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and 10 normal volunteers. RESULTS: Expressions of Cyr61 and VEGF were higher in MDS and AML patients than in controls (P < 0.05). The expressions of Cyr61 and VEGF were significantly higher in high risk group (0.3998 +/- 0.2647, 0.4775 +/- 0.1342) than that in low risk MDS group (0.2213 +/- 0.1465, 0.2872 +/- 0.2341) (P < 0.05), but no significant difference between high risk MDS and AML patients. Expressions of Cyr61 and VEGF protein were higher in MDS patients than in normal controls (P < 0.05), and were significantly higher in high risk MDS group \[(38.7 +/- 2.9)%, (43.2 +/- 2.7)%\] than in low risk group \[(31.4 +/- 3.1)%, (33.5 +/- 3.4)%\] (P < 0.05). Expressions of Cyr61 and VEGF were significantly correlated (r = 0.8762, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Cyr61 and VEGF may play a role in the angiogenesis and pathogenesis of MDS.
