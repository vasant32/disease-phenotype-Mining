Secondary acute myeloid leukemia with threelineage displasy (sAML/MDS) has been described as a complication of therapeutic approach with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) in the patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). It is not yet clear whether the sAML/MDS is a consequence of a standard therapeutic regimen, applied before transplantation, or a high-dose chemotherapy. In a female patient with initially resistant form of HD at III-B-b clinical stadium (bulky disease in neck and mediastinum) after the initial treatment (MOPPx4; ABVDx3; BEA-COPPx2), high-dose chemotherapy has been applied according to BEAM protocol with autologous SCT. In a period after transplantation, radiotherapy (RT) has been applied at initial region of the disease and a patient reached complete remission (CR), which lasted for a 27 months. After that period sAML/MDS has been observed. Application of more standard therapeutic cycles and characteristic cytogenetic findings are the facts that support the opinion that sAML/MDS is a consequence of standard treatment before transplantation, rather than high-dose chemotherapy. That finding implies the need for correct choice of the HD patients suitable for early SCT therapeutic approach.
