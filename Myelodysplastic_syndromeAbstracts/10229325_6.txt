It is known that the levels of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) are greatly reduced in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To date, however, only limited information exists on the growth kinetics of these cells in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC), particularly in terms of erythroid and multipotent progenitors. In the present study, we have determined the HPC content in the bone marrow of 12 MDS patients and followed the proliferation kinetics of myeloid (including granulocyte, macrophage and granulocyte macrophage), erythroid (including early and late) and multipotent progenitor cells in LTMC throughout a 7-week culture period. Both the non-adherent and adherent fractions of the cultures were analyzed, so we were able to look at progenitor cells in suspension and those that physically associated to the stromal cell layer developed in culture. All 12 patients were grouped based on their FAB subtype and the in vitro growth of the HPC was analyzed accordingly. The results presented here indicate that in the majority of MDS patients, pronounced deficiencies exist both in the content and the long-term proliferation of marrow HPC. Such deficiencies were particularly evident for multipotent progenitors and those committed to the erythroid lineage, in which alterations in the maturation process also seem to be present. Our results suggest that, at least in some patients, HPC--besides showing an impaired proliferative capacity--lose their ability to adhere to the stromal cell layers developed in culture. RA patients showed the less affected in vitro HPC growth, whereas HPC from RAEB and RAEB-t showed a markedly deficient growth in culture. Interestingly, myelopoiesis was significantly increased in cultures of CMML patients. These results give some new insights into the biology of MDS-derived HPC.
