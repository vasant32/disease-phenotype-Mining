OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the detection of trisomy 8 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) and interphase FISH using SpectrumGreen labelled chromosome 8 centromere specific probe were simultaneously carried out to detect trisomy 8 in 69 MDS and 6 normal individuals. RESULTS: Two hundred interphase cells were counted and cells with three green hybridization spots > 3% was assigned. Eleven cases displayed trisomy 8 by CC and were confirmed in 10 by FISH. In 7 cases, the percentage of trisomy 8 cells was significantly lower by FISH than by CC. Seven cases displayed trisomy 8 by FISH in 58 cases who did not show trisomy 8 by CC. Of the 7 cases, two had 2 and 3 marker chromosomes respectively, 4 had normal karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Interphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome. It was a important complement to CC.
