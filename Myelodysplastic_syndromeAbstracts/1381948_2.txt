A case of myelodysplasia was found to have a complex bone marrow karyotype, involving an apparent whole-arm translocation between 17q and 18q. The application of a simplified fluorescence in situ hybridization technique, using directly fluorochrome-labeled centromere-specific alpha-satellite DNA probes, demonstrated the presence of sequences from both chromosomes 17 and 18 in the centromere of the derivative chromosome. This proves that a true whole-arm translocation had occurred. The case exemplifies how in situ hybridization analysis can be used to resolve interpretation problems in cancer cytogenetics.
