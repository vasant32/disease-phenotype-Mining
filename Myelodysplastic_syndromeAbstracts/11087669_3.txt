Loss of a whole chromosome 5, or a del(5q), is a recurring abnormality in malignant myeloid diseases. By cytogenetic and molecular analyses, we delineated previously a 1- to 1.5-Mb region that is deleted in all patients with a del(5q). In our efforts to identify a myeloid tumor suppressor gene within the commonly deleted segment (CDS), we have cloned and characterized the genes encoding three putative nuclear proteins, each of which contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). In addition, C5ORF5 contains a putative rhoGAP domain at the N-terminus, C5ORF6 has a proline-rich sequence near the N-terminus, and C5ORF7 has a zinc-finger domain that partially overlaps the NLS. All three genes are ubiquitously expressed and encode novel proteins. The C5ORF5 cDNA is 5.47 kb encoding a protein of 915 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 105 kDa. C5ORF5 has 23 exons spanning over 27 kb. The C5ORF6 transcript is 4.1 kb encoding a protein of 392 aa with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 43 kDa. C5ORF6 has 5 exons and spans approximately 11 kb. The C5ORF7 cDNA is 6.3 kb and encodes a protein of 1417 aa with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 155 kDa. C5ORF7 has 24 exons spanning approximately 64 kb. All three genes were localized to the distal half of the CDS between D5S1983 and D5S500. We evaluated each as a candidate tumor suppressor gene by the analysis of myeloid leukemia cells from patients with -5/del(5q), but no inactivating mutations were identified.
