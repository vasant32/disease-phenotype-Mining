Fifteen patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders were treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside therapy. While severe toxicity was produced in every patient, only two of the 15 patients entered complete remission and two achieved partial remission status. The therapeutic responses were confined to patients who had severe myelofibrosis of apparently recent onset.
