Cytogenetic analysis of 72 consecutive de novo myelodysplastic syndrome patients revealed monosomy 7 in 12 cases. In 4 of these cases, the -7 was the only abnormality, whereas the remaining 8 cases showed additional chromosomal aberrations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) utilizing chromosome 7 alpha-satellite and painting probes and other specific probes, when necessary, provided evidence of unusual and unsuspected structural rearrangements involving chromosome 7. FISH analysis showed that the small fragment found in one patient and the ring found in each of two other patients were chromosome 7-derived rings. FISH also revealed the insertion of chromosome 7 sequences into autosomes in three other patients and unusual translocations in the remaining two patients. By comparing the results obtained by using banding techniques to those obtained by using the FISH technique, we deduced the involvement of chromosome 7 with partial deletion of the short arm in all eight examined patients. Our study confirms the ability of FISH to detect chromosomal aberrations that would otherwise not be identified and the tendency of chromosome 7 to be involved in many different rearrangements. From a clinical point of view, we confirm that patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes with complex karyotypes involving chromosome 7 do not respond to treatment and have a poor prognosis.
