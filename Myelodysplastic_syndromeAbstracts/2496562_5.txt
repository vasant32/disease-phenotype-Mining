The authors describe a case of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) showing trisomy of chromosome 8. This anomaly, particularly common in cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), has never been previously found to be associated with this rare type of leukemia. Thus CNL may occasionally be cytogenetically indistinguishable from cases of MDS.
