A 57-year-old female developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that terminated as a biphenotypic leukemia after exposure to chemoradiotherapy. Double staining of blast cells, using monoclonal antibodies specific for myeloid and lymphoid lineage, demonstrated that one-third of the leukemic cells simultaneously expressed the E rosette-associated antigen (OKT11) and myeloid-associated antigen (MY7). This finding suggests the possibility that some cases of MDS are clonal disorders that arise in a pluripotent stem cell that can also differentiate to T cell lineage.
