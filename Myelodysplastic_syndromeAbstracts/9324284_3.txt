Between May 1984 and October 1995 we performed 114 autologous stem cell transplants for lymphoma in our centre; 77/114 (68%) were transplanted after primary therapy. The conditioning regimen varied according to diagnosis; 26 patients were conditioned with melphalan and total body irradiation, 66 received melphalan and etoposide and the remainder (50) were conditioned with melphalan alone. The median follow-up is 62 months. Only two new haematological malignancies have occurred, both in patients with Hodgkin's disease. One patient developed Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia 18 months post-transplant. In this case, because of the timing of the haematological disorder, we considered the malignancy to be concurrent with or to have preceded the transplant. A second patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia 20 months post-transplant. She had been treated for Hodgkin's disease for 10 years and was transplanted in third complete remission. Cytogenetic analysis in this case showed trisomy 11. We believe this to have been an unequivocal second malignancy. Our finding of a 1.1% incidence of secondary haematological malignancy (95% CI 0.02-4.96) from a census population adds weight to the hypothesis that haematological problems post-transplant reflects prior chemotherapy rather than toxicity from the transplant procedure itself.
