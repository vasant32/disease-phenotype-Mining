Gene amplification is one of the mechanisms for activating proto-oncogenes resulting in an enhanced expression of the corresponding gene product. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), amplification of the proto-oncogene MLL has been described only in seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report five new patients (four had de novo AML, one had a de novo myelodysplastic syndrome) displaying different mechanisms of MLL amplification, suspected by G-banding and confirmed by FISH analysis. In two patients, MLL was amplified on double-minute chromosomes (dmins). In both cases, an interstitial deletion in 11q23 including the MLL gene was associated with the occurrence of the dmins containing MLL. As a rarely described mechanism, MLL amplification in the form of size-variable ring chromosomes was observed in two patients. Remodeling of the ring chromosomes leads to multiple copies of MLL and obviously provided a selective growth advantage. In one of the two cases with ring chromosomes, the centromeric alpha-satellite DNA of the ring chromosome was not detectable. Our fifth patient showed the unique finding of MLL amplification within a uniformly (homogeneously?) stained region in interaction with amplified ribosomal DNA sequences. Also, one of the patients with ring chromosomes exhibited the amplification of ribosomal DNA on the ring chromosomes. The transcriptionally active genes for ribosomal RNA could probably enhance the expression of MLL. In one of our five patients, we found the new combination of concomitant amplification of the proto-oncogenes MLL and MYC.
