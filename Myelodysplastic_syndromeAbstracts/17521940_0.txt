Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) allogeneic transplantation is now commonly used as a therapeutic tool in patients with certain types of hematologic malignancies. Such patients, on account of severe pre-graft conditioning regimens, present with severe marrow aplasia justifying specific transfusion care. Given a complex immunological situation (immediately after transplantation, co-existence of two cell populations with different immunohematological characteristics), transfusion protocols must rest on clear and well-defined recommendations. Recent transfusion recommendations in settings of HSC allogeneic transplantation have defined criteria for the choice of blood products (red blood cell concentrates, plasma and platelet concentrates) depending on recipient and graft immunohematological characteristics (minor/major/mixed ABO compatibility/incompatibility and time of transplantation). Transfusion instructions are summarized in a synthesis document entitled : "Instructions for transfusion following HSC allogeneic transplantation". This document specifies the immunohematological characteristics of blood products and various transfusion protocols (systematic irradiation, negative CMV, etc.). This document is used by the teams who distribute blood products, for selection purposes, as well as by the medical transfusion team when they perform ultimate pre-transfusion control steps.
