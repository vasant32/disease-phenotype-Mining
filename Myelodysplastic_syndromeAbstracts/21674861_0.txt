 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of the expression status of 10 different genes involved in epigenetic regulation and apoptosis by the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-Aza), as markers of response to treatment, in two different human malignant haematopoietic cell lines. METHODS: In our analysis we used the SybrGreen technology and gene-specific primers for the qRT-PCR analysis of 10 genes, in cDNA of PC-MDS and K562 cell lines, treated by 1 micromole of 5-Aza for 24h. RESULTS: DNMT1 and DNMT3A showed statistically significant decrease of expression in 5-Aza-treated PC-MDS cells, whereas DNMT3B showed significantly decreased expression in 5-Aza-treated K562 cells. The members of the Bcl- 2 family of apoptosis-regulating genes Bcl-2 and Bax showed statistically significant differences in expression, in comparison with non-treated PC-MDS cells. Our most interesting result was the significant upregulation (re-expression) of p15, in 5-Aza-treated PC-MDS cells. CONCLUSION: The re-expression of p15 in PC-MDS cell line evaluated by qRT-PCR makes this novel cell line a suitable model for the studies of pharmacologic demethylation as a plausible mechanism resulting in hematologic response in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
