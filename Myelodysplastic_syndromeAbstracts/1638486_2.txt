A 51-year-old woman with no history of prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia (ET) according to the diagnostic criteria established by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG). Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow metaphases revealed both normal female karyotype and a single clonal abnormality, 46,XX,del(5)(q22q35). While chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in ET, their incidence is very low, and no specific abnormality has been found. Many of the reported cases of ET with chromosomal aberrations, including 5q-, do not meet the diagnostic criteria proposed by the PVSG, and may represent one of the other myeloproliferative disorders or a myelodysplastic syndrome. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the 5q- syndrome, which may present with thrombocytosis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, from ET. Our patient appears to be the first example of untreated ET clearly meeting the PVSG criteria in which 5q- was the only clonal abnormality seen at diagnosis.
