We report 2 of 80 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) cytogenetically studied, with involvement of chromosome 13. The first case had a t(6;13), and the second had a t(1;13). Abnormalities of chromosome 13 mainly involving loss of band 13q14 have been described in hematologic malignancies. In both our cases band 13q14 did not participate in the deleted segment.
