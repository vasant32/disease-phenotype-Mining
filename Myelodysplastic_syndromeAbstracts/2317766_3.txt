We describe a technique for freezing and thawing human leukemic cells for cytogenetic studies. We studied 64 harvests on 26 cryopreserved samples from 20 individuals. Chromosome quality was best in the samples from patients with myeloid disturbances. Successful chromosome studies of approximately 50% of the samples were accomplished. Cryopreservation of leukemic cells is not a substitute for fresh material because the method produces relatively few metaphases and mediocre chromosome spreading and banding. However, when rigid and appropriate research objectives are applied, chromosome analysis of cryopreserved leukemic cells can be a viable alternative to analysis of fresh cells.
