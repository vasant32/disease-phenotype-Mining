BACKGROUND: Treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) remains unsatisfactory. A limited number of reports provide contradictory information on whether danazol, a synthetic androgen, may be useful in patients with MDS. METHODS: Between 1984 and 1992, 76 patients were treated with danazol (Danatrol, Winthrop) in an open nonrandomized study. Clinical status, blood counts, differential marrow cell counts, transfusion requirements, and liver enzymes were monitored at 3-month intervals during and 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. The authors present the retrospective analysis of this cohort of patients. RESULTS: This study shows a limited usefulness of danazol in patients with MDS. Blood counts were not significantly changed during danazol administration; neither were transfusion requirements. Overall survival and the rate of leukemic transformation were not affected when compared with 50 untreated patients or with data available in the literature. An increase in platelet numbers in four patients and in hemoglobin level in one patient was observed; these patients were unremarkable and were not transfused before initial danazol therapy; therefore, changes in blood counts were of limited clinical significance. The search for subgroups of patients likely to have a favorable response was unsuccessful. Side effects of danazol were limited. In addition, this study provides information on the frequency of antiplatelet antibodies and other autoantibodies in patients with MDS. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support a positive effect of danazol in patients with MDS during long term follow-up. Anecdotal positive evolution in a few patients cannot be formally ascribed to danazol. These results should be interpreted by comparison with previous publications that report on small numbers of patients with limited follow-up. Based on these data, the authors cannot recommend the systematic use of danazol in MDS.
