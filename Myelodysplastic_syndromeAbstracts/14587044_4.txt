Dermatomyositis (DM) has not yet been reported as a complication of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 50-year-old man was diagnosed as having MDS because of the presence of anemia, the appearance of immature cells in peripheral blood, and the abnormal cellular morphology. A few months later, high fever, myalgia and erythema developed. Although DM symptoms were resistant to high-dose corticosteroid administration, methotrexate (MTX) therapy improved not only the symptoms of DM but also hematologic findings related to MDS. This indicates that immunosuppressive therapy including MTX administration can be useful for patients with MDS with autoimmune symptoms.
