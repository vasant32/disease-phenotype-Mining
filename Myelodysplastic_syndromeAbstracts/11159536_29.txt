The TEL gene on 12p12-13 is a target for a number of translocations associated with various hematological malignancies. The fusion of the TEL gene to the Syk gene in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with t(9;12)(q22;p12) is reported. Southern blot analysis of patient bone marrow cells with TEL and Syk gene probes detected rearranged fragments. Anchored polymerase chain reaction identified the Syk gene, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, on 9q22 fused downstream of TEL exon 5. The TEL gene was fused in-frame to Syk and produced a fusion protein that was constitutively phosphorylated in tyrosine with dimerization that was mediated by the helix-loop-helix domain of TEL. A TEL-Syk fusion product transformed the murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to interleukin-3 growth factor independence. TEL-Syk is a novel transforming protein and leads to the transformation of hematopoietic cells. These data implicate that the rearranged Syk gene is involved in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies.
