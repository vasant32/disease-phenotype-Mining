PURPOSE: Evaluation of MRI perfusion parameters of the lumbar spine in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to determine the vascularisation and anti-angiogenetic effects of thalidomide therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 20 healthy normal persons and 28 MDS patients a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (d-MRI) of the lumbar spine was performed. After the initial d-MRI-investigation 24 of the 28 MDS patients received an anti-angiogenetic therapy with thalidomide. With an average of 4.2 months after the beginning of therapy a d-MRI-follow-up examination in 9 of these patients was performed. The amplitude and exchange-rate constant were calculated and a statistical comparison of these values between healthy persons and MDS patients as well as a correlation with the clinical course was executed. RESULTS: Compared with the normal controls the MDS patients showed a higher amplitude (normal persons: 14.4 +/- 5.2, MDS: 24.8 +/- 8.1) and exchange-rate constant (normal persons: 0.124 +/- 0.042, MDS: 0.136 +/- 0.036). In 7 of 9 MDS patients undergoing thalidomide therapy a reduction of the amplitude and exchange rate constant values was evident in the d-MRI follow-up examinations. Clinically these patients showed a therapy response with complete or partial disease remission. CONCLUSIONS: In MDS patients significantly higher d-MRI parameters can be demonstrated than in normal persons. Under anti-angiogenetic treatment these values decrease in case of a response to therapy. Thus, d-MRI seems suitable for the evaluation of anti-angiogenetic therapy effects.
