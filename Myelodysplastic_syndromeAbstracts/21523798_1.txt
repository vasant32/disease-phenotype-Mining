The impact of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) on the outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from unrelated -donors (UD) remains to be determined. We therefore assessed 128 patients, aged 16 to 66 years, with acute leukemia (n = 105) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 23) in a UD-HCT trial using RIC with busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. Patients were transplanted with unmanipulated bone marrow (BM, n = 41) or mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (M-PB, n = 87) and received cyclosporine and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. After a median follow-up of 26.7 months (range, 5.9-70.7 months) in surviving patients, 19 patients had died without progression/recurrence of underlying disease, giving a cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) of 17% (95% confidence interval, 11%-27%; 1-year TRM, 14%). Graft failure (n = 7) and infections (n = 5) were the most common causes of TRM. Only three patients died due to GVHD (acute, one; chronic, two). Graft failure, which occurred in eight patients, showed a significant correlation with graft source (BM, 6/41 vs. M-PB, 2/87; P = 0.009). Donor-patient HLA-disparity did not correlate with GVHD, 1-year TRM, and graft failure. RIC containing antithymocyte globulin led to decreased GVHD-associated, as well as overall, TRM after UD-HCT.
