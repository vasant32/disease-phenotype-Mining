Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in childhood are rare hematologic diseases. MDS with t(3;5) (NPM/MLF1) is an unusual subtype without a well-defined clinical and prognostic pattern. A poor outcome has been reported, suggesting that hematopoietic transplantation is the only treatment option. Here in we described a 2-year-old child diagnosed with the disease, without a suitable hematopoietic donor, treated early in the disease with chemotherapy. He is alive and well 4 years after the end of treatment. This unusual MDS needs further studies to better understand the disease.
