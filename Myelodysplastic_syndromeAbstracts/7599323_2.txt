To clarify the biological behavior of micromegakaryocytes in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the relationship between the morphological classification and the ploidy of megakaryocytes was studied in bone marrow aspirates obtained from patients with MDS and from normal controls. The morphology was determined according to Feinendegen's classification, which is considered to reflect megakaryocytic maturation, and the ploidy was determined by microcytofluorometry, using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining after the removal of Wright-Giemsa stain. Most micromegakaryocytes (i.e., megakaryocytes < 20 microns in diameter) in MDS were morphologically mature, as were those in the normal controls. The peak micromegakaryocytic ploidy was 4N or 8N, whereas that of the megakaryocytes in normal controls was 16N. These findings indicated that the micromegakaryocytes in MDS were morphologically mature but had impaired polyploidization.
