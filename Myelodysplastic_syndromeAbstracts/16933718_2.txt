Angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of haematological neoplasms and may be correlated with the prognosis. We recently evaluated the microvessel densities in trephine biopsy sections of seventeen patients of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Of the 17 cases, 2 were RAEB-t, 3 were RAEB, one was RARS and 11 were of the subtype RA (FAB subtyping). The microvessel counts were measured in the bone marrow biopsy sections by immunohistochemical staining, using CD34 reactive monoclonal antibodies. MVD was significantly higher in the cases of RAEB and RAEB-t as compared to the cases of RA. The average MVD per x400 in the cases of RA was 5.7 +/- 4.7 with a median value of 4.65 (range 19) whereas it was 45.4 +/- 10.0 and 44.0 (range 27.3) respectively in RAEB and RAEB-t (p <.001), the 95% confidence interval being (2.94, 8.5) and (36.6, 54.3), for the two groups respectively. This finding may imply that subtypes of MDS with a higher tendency for converting to acute leukaemia are associated with increased angiogenesis as compared to other subtypes where the risk of progression to acute leukaemia is much lower.
