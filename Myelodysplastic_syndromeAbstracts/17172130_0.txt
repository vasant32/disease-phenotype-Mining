 OBJECTIVE: To summarize the diagnostic experience of primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in order to improve the diagnostic level. METHODS: Using prospective cohort study to collect consecutive samples. Diagnoses of 282 MDS cases were defined according to FAB and WHO classification. RESULTS: The median age at MDS onset was 56. 19.5% and 24.5% of cases occurred at age 50 - 59 and 70 - 79, respectively. Presence of immature granulocytes and erythroblasts in peripheral blood (PB) were found in 67% and 48% of the MDS patients, respectively. The percentage (68%) of FAB-RA and WHO-RCMD patients in China is relatively high compared to that in western countries. The abnormality of chromosome (31.2%) was lower than that in the West, and similar to that in Japan. Eighty nine percent of the MDS patients could be diagnosed on cell morphology in PB and bone marrow (BM) aspirate. Ninety four percent of MDS could be diagnosed by combination of BM aspirate and core biopsy. Ninety seven percent of the patients could be recognized by combination of bone marrow aspirate, core biopsy and cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: The subtypes and clinical features of Chinese MDS patients were somewhat different from the West, but similar to that in Japan. Diagnostic efficiency can be extremely improved by combination of bone marrow aspirate, core biopsy and cytogenetics.
