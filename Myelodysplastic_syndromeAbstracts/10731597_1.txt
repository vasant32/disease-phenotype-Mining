Acute myeloid leukemia with minimal signs of myeloid differentiation (AML-M0) is a recent addition to the FAB group classification. Chromosome data is scarce, but existing reports describe a high incidence of complex karyotypes and myelodysplastic syndrome-like chromosome alterations, while single chromosome translocations have rarely been reported. We describe the case of a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with AML-M0 with a novel translocation t(11;12)(q23-24;q24) as the sole karyotypic marker. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to assess MLL gene splitting did not show rearrangement of this oncogene.
