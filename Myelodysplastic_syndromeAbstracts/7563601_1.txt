A 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, IgG lambda type Durie-Salmon Stage II, was admitted because of gradually developing anemia and increased blasts with abnormal karyotype in her bone marrow after 10 years of treatment. The chromosomal analysis showed 44, XX, del(5q), del(7q), -9, add(12p), -21, typical of secondary MDS due to the cumulative alkylating agents. Thrombocytosis concomitantly occurred with emergence of chromosomal abnormality, but the serum interleukin 6 level was not elevated, which suggested that it was related to development of secondary MDS.
