 BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is an oral, small-molecule targeting therapy which inhibits epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors. Erlotinib has been administered for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present report, unusual hematologic complications were detected after erlotinib was administered as second-line monotherapy in pretreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Four patients pre-treated with cisplatin or its analog-based combinations, were evaluated. Erlotinib was given at a dose of 150 mg daily. In cases of intolerable adverse reactions, the dose was either reduced to 100 mg daily or treatment was interrupted for a maximum of two weeks. RESULTS: Serious hematologic toxicity (or complications) developed in these 4 patients after 4-8.5 months of treatment. Two patients developed leukemias (AML, CML) and two, myelodysplastic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Whether or not these hematologic complications were related to erlotinib treatment is comprehensively discussed.
