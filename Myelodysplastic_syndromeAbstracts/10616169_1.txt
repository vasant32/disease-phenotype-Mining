Glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 polymorphism is a marker for susceptibility to smoking-related neoplasms, such as lung and bladder cancer. Recently, a genetic deletion of GSTT1, an isoenzyme of GST, has been reported to be associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A 59-year-old man with a long-term smoking habit was treated successfully for non-small-cell lung cancer. Four years after the surgical removal of his lung cancer, he developed MDS and died. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping method, he was found to have a deletion of both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. Screening for the deletion of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes may be useful for assessing individual genetic susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancer and MDS.
