Responsiveness of bone marrow erythropoietic stem cells (CFU-E and BFU-E) to recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-Ep) was examined in vitro in 23 patients with aplastic anemia and 14 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to investigate the clinical use of rh-Ep for these diseases. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured by methylcellulose methods for CFU-E and BFU-E assays. In normals, the CFU-E numbers reached a plateau of increase at Ep doses of almost 2-5 units, and no further increase was observed with the addition of larger Ep doses. In aplastic anemia, the responses of CFU-E to Ep were relatively good in nonsevere type and generally poor in severe type. However, the CFU-E numbers increased with increasing doses of Ep in some of the patients with aplastic anemia. Among the patients with MDS, the responses of CFU-E to Ep were relatively good in primary acquired refractory anemia (PARA) and primary acquired sideroblastic anemia. On the other hand, the responses of CFU-E to Ep were poor in refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation among the MDS patients. BFU-E responses to Ep were poor in severe aplastic anemia, RAEB, and RAEB-T. However, there are Ep responsive patients in some of aplastic anemia and PARA. High titers of rh-Ep were suggested to be effective clinically in some patients with aplastic anemia and those with PARA.
