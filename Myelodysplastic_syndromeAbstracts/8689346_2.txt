 PURPOSE: This study reports the association of myelodysplasia with Turner syndrome. PATIENT AND METHODS: An 11-year-old girl with Turner syndrome was found to have mild macrocytic anemia that persisted during 2 years. RESULTS: Examination of the bone marrow revealed dyserythropoietic features with multinucleation consistent with refractory anemia. Levels of hemoglobin F were also markedly elevated (57%). She also had transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, as well as abnormal platelet function studies. The hematopoietic abnormalities were mild and may have been missed were she not followed for her hypertension and aortic coarctation. CONCLUSIONS: Myelodysplastic syndromes in children are frequently associated with chromosomal abnormalities, but an association with Turner syndrome has not been previously described. This could be due to the fact that mild hematopoietic abnormalities in these patients may not be investigated.
