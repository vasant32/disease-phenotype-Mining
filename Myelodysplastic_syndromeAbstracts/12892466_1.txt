Cardiac surgery in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) increases the risk of bleeding and infection. Here we report a case of a 70-year-old man with MDS who underwent successful replacement of the aortic root with the valve-sparing technique and proximal arch for aneurysmal dilatation from the aortic root to ascending aorta with moderate aortic valve regurgitation. Perioperatively, a transfusion of red blood cells and an infusion of a grannulocyte colony-stimulating factor were required for his serious erythrocytopenia and leukocytopenia. Bleeding tendency was so severe that re-exploration to control postoperative surgical bleeding was performed and a large amount of blood cells were transfused. There was no infection on the postoperative course. Perioperative management for cardiac surgery in patients with MDS must be carefully programmed by a co-operative team consisting of cardiovascular surgeons and hematologists.
