Fungal infections represent a life-threatening complication for patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Historically, antifungal monotherapy is associated with a poor outcome. We treated three children with hematological malignancies and proven fungal infections (one cerebral mold infection, one disseminated Candida infection, one naso-pharyngeal mucor infection) with combination antifungal therapy plus granulocyte-colony-stimulation-factor-mobilized granulocyte transfusions as secondary prophylaxis during subsequent neutropenic episodes. With this approach, the fungal infection was effectively treated, and the anticancer therapy was completed without major delay. All children survived the fungal infection and the underlying malignancy. These experiences illustrate the feasibility of this approach using more than one antifungal agent together with immune-therapy in high-risk patients.
