We report the case of a 36 year old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and pancytopenia with refractory anemia with excess blasts confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. He was subsequently found to have advanced HIV infection. Both the HIV infection and the myelodysplastic syndrome responded to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) with sustained normalization of his hematologic abnormalities within 79 days.
