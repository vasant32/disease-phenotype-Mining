Cytosine arabinoside, 3 g/m2, every 12 h for 6 days, followed by fractionated total body irradiation, 200 cGy twice daily for 3 days, was administered to 39 adult patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Allogeneic transplant patients received cyclosporin and methotrexate for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease. There were 21 autologous transplants (16 with acute leukemia, four with an advanced stage of chronic myelocytic leukemia, and one with lymphoma) and 18 allogeneic transplants (14 with acute leukemia, two with an advanced stage of chronic myelocytic leukemia and two with myelodysplastic syndrome). Toxicities were compared between the two groups. There was a significantly greater degree and duration of mucositis and a greater frequency of radiation-type retinopathy developing in the allogeneic group, predominantly in those having had radiation for prophylaxis or treatment of central nervous system leukemia. Seven of 11 acute leukemic patients who received autologous transplants in remission survive. Two of seven acute leukemias who received allogeneic transplants while in remission survive. Although the increased morbidity, retinitis and mucositis, observed in the allogeneic group indicates that this regimen when combined with methotrexate and cyclosporin is too toxic, the results in autologous transplantation in acute leukemia in remission are encouraging.
