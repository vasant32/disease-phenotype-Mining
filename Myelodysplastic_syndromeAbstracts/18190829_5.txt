Hemorrhagic cystitis is 1 of the most troublesome complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning regimens. We conducted a nonrandomized controlled clinical study to investigate the role of continuous bladder irrigation in addition to mesna, hydration, and alkalization in the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. A total of 80 eligible patients entered the study. From May 2006, 40 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation received continuous bladder irrigation in addition to the common protocol. A historical control group of 40 consecutive patients with same inclusion criteria who did not receive bladder irrigation was enrolled from before May 2006. Hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 50% of patients in the no bladder irrigation group versus 32% in bladder irrigation group (P = 0.11). The mean duration of hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly reduced in the bladder irrigation group (10 vs. 18 days; P = 0.02). Duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the bladder irrigation group (30.2 vs. 39.6; P < 0.001). Late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis that occurred beyond 4 weeks after allo-hemorrhagic cystitis happened more significantly in the no bladder irrigation group (P = 0.001). High-grade hemorrhagic cystitis was more frequently associated with high-grade graft-versus-host disease within 30 days after transplant (P = 0.06). In general, continuous bladder irrigation added to mesna, hydration, and alkalization regimens was well tolerated, decreased the complications of hemorrhagic cystitis, and may be useful in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. However, more investigations with randomized controlled clinical trials with more patients are needed.
