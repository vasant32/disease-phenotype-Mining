We report here the case of a patient with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) which evolved into RAEB in transformation. The standard Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome was found by cytogenetic study at diagnosis and during evolution. Southern blot analysis showed breakpoint cluster region (bcr) rearrangement as observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
