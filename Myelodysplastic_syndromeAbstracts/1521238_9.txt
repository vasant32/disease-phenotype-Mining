Chromosome analyses were performed in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who showed trisomy of chromosome 8 during the course of their disease. Four of these patients showed trisomy 8 at the diagnosis of MDS, and the remaining one had trisomy 8 when the leukemia phase developed. The proportion of bone marrow (BM) cells with trisomy 8 in the four patients who showed trisomy 8 at MDS diagnosis fluctuated, and this fluctuation was not related to the percentage of blasts in the BM or to progression of the disease. However, in two patients, metaphase cells with trisomy 8 disappeared when their anemic state improved, although leuko-thrombocytopenia was still present, suggesting that the decrease in the number of BM cells with trisomy 8 reflects hematologic features in some MDS patients. These findings indicate that trisomy 8 in our MDS patients was possibly not the primary event in the genesis of the disease, and that there may have been competition between a normal karyotype clone and a trisomy-8-positive clone. Our results further suggest that the presence of a clone with trisomy 8 is not always a sign of disease progression or of poor prognosis in MDS patients.
