The proliferation characteristics of leukemic cells may be a determining factor in disease course and response to therapy. The present study compares the rate of cell-cycle progression in the bone marrow of 16 hematologically normal subjects, 19 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 23 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in bone marrow cells is also compared. MDS and AML patients showed a reduction in the rate of cell-cycle progression compared with normal subjects. Patients with 'high risk' MDS (RAEB/RAEB-t) did not differ significantly from patients with AML but had a significantly slower rate of cell-cycle progression than patients with 'low-risk' MDS (PASA/RA). There was no correlation between the rate of cell-cycle progression and clonal karyotype status or the percentage of blast cells in either MDS or AML. There were no significant differences in SCE frequency between normal subjects and MDS or AML patients.
