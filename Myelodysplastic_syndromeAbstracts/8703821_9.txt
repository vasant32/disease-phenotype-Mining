With the increasing use of chemotherapy for many different primary malignancies, secondary or therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are becoming more common. The risk of developing sAML has been estimated to be between 2% and 10%, depending upon the type, duration and dosage of previous therapy (Michels et al, 1985; Shulman, 1993; Robinson & Mertens, 1993; Ballen & Antin, 1993). It is therefore one of the most serious long-term complications of current cancer treatment and is likely to increase as longer survival rates for the primary tumour are achieved. An increasing range of drugs have been reported to cause sAML, including the alkylating agents, the epipodophyllotoxins and the anthracyclines, both as single agents and in combination (Pedersen-Bjergaard & Philip, 1991; Pedersen-Bjergaard & Rowley, 1994). We report two cases of secondary AML in which platinum compounds were the sole prior chemotherapy.
