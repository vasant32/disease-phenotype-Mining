We report a case of fungemia caused by Scedosporium prolificans, an emerging pathogen. An 83-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and agranulocytosis was admitted for pneumonia in January 2009. He was treated with meropenem, minocycline, and gamma-globulin for pneumonia and G-CSF and platelet transfusion for MDS. Although he recovered from pneumonia as neutrophil count increased, intermittent fever continued. On hospital day 17, blood culture yielded fungal colonies indicating S. prolificans. Voriconazole was started immediately, but the man's general condition deteriorated with cerebral infarction and he died of cerebral hemorrhage on hospital day 65. Attention must therefore be paid to the increasing scedosporiosis incidence in Japan.
