The aim of this study was to test the clinical utility of reticulocyte maturation parameters in the differential diagnosis of macrocytic anemias. Using an automated reticulocyte counter, we analyzed immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), mean reticulocyte volume (MRV) and mean fluorescence index (MFI) in peripheral blood samples from healthy donors (n = 30), patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 35), with megaloblastic anemia (MA, n = 10) and with non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemias (NMMA, n = 30). Macrocytic anemias due to ineffective erythropoiesis (MA and MDS) showed reticulocytes skewed to a more immature fraction. Therefore, they have a larger volume and a greater RNA content than healthy controls. Interestingly, reticulocytes in both low and high risk MDS are significantly larger (127.3 vs. 118.3 fl, P < 0.01) and have a greater RNA content (MFI 20.5 vs. 12.9, P < 0.01 and IRF 22.5 vs. 9.1%, P < 0.01) than NMMA patients. We conclude that measurement of reticulocyte maturation parameters may be a very useful tool in the differential diagnosis of macrocytic anemia. The presence of extremely high values of IRF (>16%), MFI (>18) and MRV (>129 fl), makes the diagnosis of NMMA very unlikely. An underlying MDS should, therefore, be sought.
