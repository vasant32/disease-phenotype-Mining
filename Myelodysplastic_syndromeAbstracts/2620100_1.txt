An expert system is described that includes interpretation of the results from a complete blood count as well as data from bone marrow aspiration. The system utilizes Bayes' rule. It has previously been tested on 180 cases of anemia including 20 benign and malignant hematologic disorders. On the data set, the system achieved 84% satisfactory diagnoses. In the present study, patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and with disorders of heme synthesis have been added to the test cases. For support, the expert system requires an IBM Personal Computer or equivalent. The program is available commercially (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL).
