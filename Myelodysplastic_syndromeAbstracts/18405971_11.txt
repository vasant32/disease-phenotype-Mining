In December 2005, 11 Canadian hematologists met to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline that would address the diagnosis, monitoring, management, and rationale for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This Expert Panel consisted of hematologists from across Canada, each with an active practice in a major population centre or a rural area. Based on an extensive literature search and years of clinical experience, their mandate was to address common clinical practice questions, particularly why treat, whom to treat, when to initiate treatment, and how to treat iron overload in patients with MDS.
