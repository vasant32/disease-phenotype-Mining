Due to infectious and bleeding risks, adults with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes typically remain hospitalized after remission induction chemotherapy until blood count recovery. Here, we explored the medical and financial effects of discharge immediately after chemotherapy completion with close outpatient follow up. Within 12 months, 15 patients fulfilling both medical and logistical criteria were discharged early, whereas 5 patients meeting medical criteria only served as inpatient controls. No patient died. Patients discharged early spent a median of 8 days (range 3-36 days), or 54% of their study time, as outpatients. These patients required less time on intravenous antibiotics (6 vs. 16 days; P=0.11), received fewer red blood cell transfusions (0.25 vs. 0.48 units/day; P=0.08), and incurred lower median daily charges ($3,270 vs. $5,467; P=0.01) than controls. Thus, early discharge of selected patients appears, safe and may reduce cost and resource utilization. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00844441).
