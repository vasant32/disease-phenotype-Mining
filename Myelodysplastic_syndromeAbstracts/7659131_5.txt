This paper describes a 71-year-old man with myelodysplasia who required multiple transfusions and subsequent deferoxamine chelation therapy and who then developed indolent cutaneous and probable pulmonary infection with Rhizopus species. The patient did not have rapidly progressive infection as has been described in almost all previously reported deferoxamine-treated patients with zygomycosis. Amphotericin B therapy was successful in curing the infection.
