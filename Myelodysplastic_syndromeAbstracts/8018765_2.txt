Seven children with a primary myelodysplastic syndrome were seen at our center over a 9-year period. Two presented with refractory anemia, three with refractory anemia with excess of blasts, and two with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. All children received supportive therapy, including blood transfusions in five of them. Three patients developed acute myeloid leukemia and were treated with intensive chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic or autologous marrow transplantation in the two responders. All three died of either infection or progressive disease. The other four patients are still alive a median of 71 months (range 38-130) after diagnosis. These results confirm the difficulties in managing patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
