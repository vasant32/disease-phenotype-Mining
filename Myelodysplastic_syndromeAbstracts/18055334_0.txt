Over the last several years, there has been substantial progress in the definition, diagnosis, and management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). This progress includes the new World Health Organization classification and the revised standardized response criteria to be applicable to most new compounds, which, taken together with the International Prognostic Scoring System, provide a uniform basis for the management of individual patients. The recent introduction of certain new agents, as well as an apparent increase in the use of stem cell transplantation with a variety of so-called reduced-intensity settings, has indeed raised the hope that we are entering a new era of MDS treatment.
