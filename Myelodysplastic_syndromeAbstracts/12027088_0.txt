We report a case of an unusual form of cutaneous tuberculosis in an 82-year-old woman. She visited our hospital because of an intractable ulcer on the fifth finger of her right hand. While examining the ulcer surrounding half of her right fifth finger and covered with necrotic tissue, we also perceived a nodule with crust on the forearm, multiple subcutaneous nodules on the right forearm and upper arm, and a hen's-egg-sized agglomerative nodule on the axilla. All the lesions were located on her right arm. Skin biopsy specimens showed granulomatous tissue with necrosis in the lesions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified by culture of a biopsied specimen, so the diagnosis was confirmed. Further examination revealed that she also had pulmonary tuberculosis. Cutaneous tuberculoses are classified morphologically with reference to host immune status, but no satisfactory classification exists. The present case can't be classified into any of the types which have been proposed so far. She is elderly and suffers from liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and myelodysplastic syndrome. The resulting acquired immunosuppression may have caused a unique form of cutaneous tuberculosis.
