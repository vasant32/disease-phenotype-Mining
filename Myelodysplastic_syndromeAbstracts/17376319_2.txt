We determined the outcome of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation according to their international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) risk categories at diagnosis. A total of 11 females and 7 males, with a median age of 45 years, were transplanted. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 6-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS) for Less Advanced (Low and Intermediate-1 risk IPSS) and Advanced (Intermediate-2 and High risk IPSS) MDS was 71.4% and 43.6%, respectively (p=0.002). We did not observe a difference in EFS depending on cytogenetics at diagnosis (good risk 53.8% Vs intermediate and high risk 53.3%, p=ns), neither on the type of conditioning regimen used (myeloablative 50% Vs reduced intensity 52.2%, p=ns). Our results support that IPSS score at diagnosis may be used to predict EFS in patients with MDS undergoing allogeneic SCT.
