Deferoxamine (DFO) is an iron chelator used to treat iron overload in patients receiving chronic blood transfusions, and is usually administered as overnight subcutaneous infusions. ISOSFER was a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study conducted in metropolitan France that evaluated patient characteristics, quality of life (QoL), compliance and patient satisfaction with DFO monotherapy. Of 70 patients with either thalassemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes, 30% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with DFO. Patients' SF-36 scores were lower than those of the general French population, and lower among patients with comorbidities and those dissatisfied with treatment. Although 72% of patients had good compliance to DFO, 57% reported missing at least one infusion in the previous month, and 82% of patients expressed a preference for oral therapy. These results suggest that QoL is severely compromised in patients receiving DFO, and that compliance is not optimal.
