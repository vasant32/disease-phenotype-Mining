Two cases of unclassified chronic myeloproliferative disorders (UCMPD), diagnosed by hematological, cytogenetic and DNA analyses, are described. Case 1: a 63 year old female was admitted because of leukocytosis (96,800/microliters) and splenomegaly. Hematological examinations revealed an increase of the granulocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score was 121. The patient developed blast crisis after 12 months of the chronic phase. Case 2: a 48 year old male was presented with fever and leukocytosis (20,000/microliters). Hematological examinations revealed an increase of granulocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The NAP score was 33. Maturation-arrest in granulocytic series and morphological abnormalities of marrow cells were not observed in the two cases. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells disclosed 46, XX, i (17 q) in case 1 and 47, XY, +8 in case 2. Southern blot analysis using 3' bcr probe and TransProbe-1 showed no bcr rearrangement. These cases are thought to be valuable in order to clarify the relationship between UCMPD and CMPD such as Ph1 negative chronic myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.
