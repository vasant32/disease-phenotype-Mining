 AIMS: We earlier identified a novel gene human CAP10-like protein 46 KD (hCLP46) from human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome CD34(+) cells, but the function of this gene remains unclear. In this study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assay was developed to quantify expression of hCLP46 in the peripheral blood of AML and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) primary samples and in six leukemic cell lines. Also, we investigated expression of CDKN2A/B and the apoptosis in U937 cells when hCLP46 is downregulated in vitro. RESULTS: Our findings showed that hCLP46 was overexpressed in AML, T-ALL, and the leukemic cell lines. Suppressing hCLP46 overexpression had no effect on expression of CDKN2A/B and apoptosis of U937 cells. CONCLUSION: Considering that hCLP46 has the capability of modifying the Notch pathway, our finding adds weight to the importance of Notch signaling in hematopoiesis and suggests that overexpression of hCLP46 might be an early event in the pathogenesis of AML and T-ALL.
