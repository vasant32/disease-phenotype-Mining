This study was aimed to investigate the effect of sodium valproate(VPA) on human myelodysplastic syndrome cell line SKM-1 and its mechanism. The cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expressions of c-flipl, c-flips and dlk1 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that VPA could inhibited the growth of SKM-1 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The flow cytometric analysis indicated that VPA could induce cell apoptosis, apoptosis rate increased in dose-dependent manner. The expressions of c-flipl, c-flips and dlk1 mRNA in SKM-1 cell treated with VPA decreased using of VPA. It is concluded that VPA can induce apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of SKM-1 cells. In this process, the decreasing of c-flipl, c-flips and dlk1 mRNA expression may play important roles.
