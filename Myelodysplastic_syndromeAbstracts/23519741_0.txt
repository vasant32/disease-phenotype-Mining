BackgroundThe alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is widely used for the treatment of gliomas. Although reports of treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with TMZ are accumulating, it remains unclear whether TMZ has the same leukemogenic potential as other alkylating agents.MethodsWe performed a single-institution retrospective analysis using a database of 359 glioma patients given nimustine (ACNU)-based therapy, TMZ-based therapy, or combination therapy, who were followed up for a minimum of 2 months, between January 1990 and December 2009, at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Japan.ResultsOf the 359 patients, 225 received ACNU alone or ACNU plus other chemotherapeutic drugs (ACNU-based group; median follow-up period, 31.4 mo), 63 patients received ACNU-based therapy followed by TMZ therapy (ACNU-TMZ group; median follow-up period, 19.1 mo), and 71 patients received TMZ alone or TMZ plus other chemotherapeutic drugs (TMZ-based group; median follow-up period, 16.9 mo). Three patients in the ACNU-based group developed MDS/AML (incidence rate: 2.9 cases per 1000 person-years), 2 patients in the ACNU-TMZ group developed MDS/AML (13.0 cases per 1000 person-years), and 1 patient in the TMZ-based group developed ALL (9.9 cases per 1000 person-years).ConclusionsDespite the limitations of this study, published reports and our results suggest that TMZ induces secondary hematological malignancies, particularly ALL, and might shorten the latency period when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
