PRDM16 is a member of the PR domain-containing protein family and is associated with various disease states including myelodysplastic syndrome and adult T-cell leukemia, as well as developmental abnormalities such as cleft palate. It is also known to act as a regulator of cell differentiation. Expression analysis of PRDM16 is limited, especially within the developing embryo. The current study evaluated the temporal and spatial localization of PRDM16 during early mouse development (embryonic days 8.5-14.5). PRDM16 was first detected on E9.5 in a limited number of tissues and by E14.5, was expressed in a broad range of developing tissues including those of the brain, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. The expression pattern is consistent with a role for PRDM16 in the development of multiple tissues. Collectively, these studies are the first to characterize the expression of the PRDM16 gene during early murine development.
