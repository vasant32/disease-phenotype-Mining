Cytogenetic analysis can be important in determining the prognosis and diagnosis of a number of hematological disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here, we compared metaphase chromosomal analyses on bone marrow aspirates from MDS patients with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for chromosomes nos. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 20. Forty-three patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E1996 for low risk MDS and five patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E3996 for high risk MDS were studied by both metaphase chromosomal analysis and interphase FISH. Excluding those with a clonal loss of the Y chromosome, an abnormal clone was detected by cytogenetic analysis in 18 of 48 samples (37.5%). In comparison, our FISH panel detected an abnormal clone in 17 of 48 samples (35.4%). Twenty-nine of 30 samples with apparently normal karyotypes, including those with a missing Y chromosome, were also normal by our FISH panel. One patient had an occult deletion of chromosome 11 that was detected by FISH. These results indicate that around 60% of patients with MDS do not have abnormalities that are detectable by either chromosomal or FISH studies. In addition, it appears that interphase FISH studies are nearly as sensitive as cytogenetic analyses and can be a useful tool in studying bone marrow aspirates where cytogenetic analysis is not possible.
