This paper reports on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by cultured mononuclear adherent cells derived from bone marrow of 25 patients affected by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of different FAB subtypes. Mean production of GM-CSF was much lower than in controls, without significant differences among different subtypes. Mean production of TNF was similar in MDS patients and in controls, but noteworthy differences were observed between patients with RA, RAEB and RAEB-t and patients with RARS and CMML. Growth of bone marrow granulocyte macrophage and erythroid progenitors did not correlate with TNF and GM-CSF production, although in MDS subtypes with higher GM-CSF levels, colony growth was slightly higher than in subtypes with lower GM-CSF production.
