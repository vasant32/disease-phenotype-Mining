The expression of three heat shock proteins (HSPs)-HSP90 alpha, HSP70, HSP27 in cells obtained from 22 patients with leukemia, K562 erythroleukemia cell line, and normal blood cells was observed by means of RNA dot blot analysis. The results showed that the expression of the HSP27 gene was enhanced in 4 cases of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), 7 cases of acute nonlymphoid leukemia (ANLL) and 2 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as compared with that of the normal blood cells, yet there was no significant difference in the HSP27 expression between the ALL and ANLL cells. The expression of HSP70 in all the 5 ALL and ANLL patients was much lower than that of the normal subjects, except 1 case of ALL and 1 case of MDS, in which the expression was obviously enhanced. All the cases including 11 ANLL, 5 ALL and 1 MDS had higher HSP90 alpha expression than the normal subjects. The enhanced expression of HSP90 alpha in leukemia cells may be associated with the active and indefinite proliferation of leukemia cells. Our results also suggest that the high expression of the HSP27 gene may not be confined to a specific type of acute leukemia.
