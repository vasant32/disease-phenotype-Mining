To study the effects and possible mechanism of Vitamin K(2) (VK(2)) in the treatment of MDS-JSN04 cells, the changes of morphologic features of MDS-JSN04 cells were investigated by cytomorphology, the apoptosis of MDS-JSN04 cells was observed by transmission electron microscope; cellular proliferation was determined by the MTT assay; cell apoptosis, cell cycle shift and expression of myeloid-specific differentiation antigen (CD11b, CD13) were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of apoptosis-related genes bcl-2, survivin and bax were detected by retrotranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the activity of caspase-3 was determined by chemiluminescence assay. The results showed that the typical apoptotic morphological features appeared in cells treated with VK(2) for 72 hours; VK(2) induced apoptosis of MDS-JSN04 cells and in a dose-and-time-dependent manner, G(0)/G(1) cell arrest and significantly down-regulated the expression of bcl-2 and survivin, but had no effect on the expression of bax; the activity of caspase-3 significantly increased. It is concluded that VK(2) induces apoptosis of MDS-JSN04 cells through activating caspase-3 pathways and the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2, survivin may play an important role in this process.
