Usually the chromosome anomalies encountered in ALL are modal number abnormalities (hyperdiploidy or hypodiploidy) and structural anomalies such as t(8;14), t(11;14), t(9;22), t(1;19) and del(6p). The 5q- syndrome is mainly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and with ANLL (M1, M2, M3). We report the case of a patient presenting with a mosaic karyotype 46,XY/92,XXYY,del(5)(q13 q34) in the following proportion 1/3 normal mitoses and 2/3 tetraploid mitoses.
