 OBJECTIVE: The advancement of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation techniques and the increase in frequency of hematological malignancy in older patients are expected to expand the indications to include more elderly patients. We investigated the problem of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in patients over 40 years old. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 21 consecutive patients (13 males and 8 females) over 40 years old who underwent allo-BMT at our center during the past 12 years. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 46 years, and 5 patients were over 50 years old. There were 8 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 5 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 2 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The 3-year overall survival rate was 43.0%. Overall survival was associated with recovery of platelets in less than 30 days and recovery of neutrophil counts in less than 15 days. We did not observe any severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or regimen-related toxicities. Twelve patients died of transplantation-related diseases. CONCLUSION: A faster recovery of the neutrophil and platelet counts was significantly associated with overall survival. Decreasing transplantation-related death, particularly by infection control, in allo-BMT in patients over age 40 is an important problem.
