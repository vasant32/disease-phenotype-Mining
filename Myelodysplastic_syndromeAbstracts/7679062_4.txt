The superoxide (O2-)-releasing capacity in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and the priming effects of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on FMLP-induced O2- release were investigated in neutrophils from 14 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The O2(-)-releasing capacity in MDS neutrophils varied from patient to patient. As compared with normal neutrophils, the O2(-)-releasing capacity in MDS neutrophils was increased in 9/14 patients, normal in three patients and decreased in two patients. There was no close relationship between the O2(-)-releasing capacity and the peripheral blood neutrophil count or the plasma concentration of C-reactive protein. The priming of neutrophils by rhG-CSF was not observed in five patients, whereas rhGM-CSF primed neutrophils from all patients. The priming effect of rhGM-CSF was consistently greater than that of rhG-CSF in each patient. The intravenous administration of rhG-CSF (300 micrograms/body) to two MDS patients showed an increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil count and enhancement of neutrophil O2- release. These findings demonstrate that the neutrophil O2(-)-releasing capacity in MDS varies from patient to patient and is not always impaired, and that rhGM-CSF is able to prime neutrophils which never respond to rhG-CSF.
