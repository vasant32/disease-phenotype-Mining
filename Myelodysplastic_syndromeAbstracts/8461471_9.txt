Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 are among the most characteristic abnormalities observed in myeloid disorders. To assess the lineage involvement of peripheral blood cells from patients with a 5q--anomaly, purified neutrophils, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity using six different highly polymorphic mininucleotide and dinucleotide (CA) repeat sequences from the 5q31 to 5q33 region. Ten patients were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and proved to be informative for at least one marker. Six patients showed a complete or partial disappearance of an allele in myeloid cells, whereas cells of lymphoid lineages exhibited full heterozygosity. The other patients displayed no allelic loss, indicating that the informative markers were located outside the deleted chromosomal segments. In addition, three female patients who were also polymorphic for the BstXI site in the PGK-1 gene were analyzed for the methylation status of this gene. Clonality of hematopoiesis, as determined by non-random X-chromosome inactivation, followed the same cell pattern as the 5q-specific allelic losses. In conclusion, using tumor-specific and clonal markers, we have demonstrated that the 5q- anomaly is restricted to cells of myeloid origin, leaving lymphoid cells unaffected.
