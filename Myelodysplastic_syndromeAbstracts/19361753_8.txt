The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of alemtuzumab on treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DSF) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) undergoing reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). We compared the outcome of 95 patients treated at the University of Chicago with fludarabine melphalan (Flu + Mel) + alemtuzumab conditioning and 59 patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center with Flu + Mel conditioning. Both groups had similar patient and donor characteristics. There were no significant differences in TRM, relapse, survival, and DFS between the 2 groups. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV (relative risk [RR] 5.5, P < .01) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (RR 6.6, P < .01) were significantly lower in patients receiving alemtuzumab. The addition of alemtuzumab to an RIC regimen dramatically reduces the incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD in patients with AML and MDS undergoing allogeneic transplantation. TRM, relapse risk, OS and DFS are not affected.
