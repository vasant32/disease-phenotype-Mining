 OBJECTIVE: To report clinical experiences and cytogenetic findings of transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in neonates with and without Down syndrome (DS). METHODS: GATA1 gene was screened in DNA samples from neonates presenting with TMD during their leukemic and remission status. RESULTS: Six neonates (2 phenotypically normal and 4 DS) born in the past 6 years had presented with TMD; all had trisomy 21 during leukemic status. Two DS infants died during early infancy, one of hepatic failure and one of cardiac complication. One non-DS infant evolved into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia since 14 months old. Three other patients have not developed true leukemia after follow-up of 8, 9, and 70 months, respectively. The authors detected mutations within exon 2 of GATA1 gene in 3 DS and 2 non-DS infants. All these mutations disappeared after remission of TMD, but an identical mutation was detected in one non-DS patient when evolving into MDS. Trisomy 21 was confined to leukemic clone in non-DS patients. CONCLUSIONS: TMD should be considered in case of congenital leukemia with megakaryoblastic features and accompanied by trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation. Both DS and non-DS patients will possibly develop true leukemia within few years.
