 INTRODUCTION: Bone marrow transplantation from HLA identical family donors is the treatment of choice for children with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA). When no donor is available, combined immunosuppressive therapy is given. AIM: Evaluation of results of immunosuppressive therapy in children with severe aplastic anaemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: SAA was diagnosed in 85 children (31 girls, 54 boys) aged 2-17.5 years in the eleven centres of the Polish Paediatric Leukaemia and Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) in Poland between 1993-2003 years. All patients received protocol of the Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party of the Europe Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT): antilymphocyte globulin or antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A, prednisolone and granulocyto- or granulocyto-macrophagic-cell stimulation factor was additionally administered during deep neutropenia. Haematological response was evaluated on day 84, 112 or 180 of the therapy. RESULTS: complete remission occurred in 43 patients (50.5%), partial remission in 22 (25.4%), no response was obtained in 20 children (23.7%) in 180 day of the therapy. Period of observation was from 12 months to 10.5 years. During this time relapse occurred in 6 patients (7%). We observed 16 deaths: 7 early during the first 3 months of immunosuppressive therapy (IS) and 9 after the first 3 months of IS. Conclusion: the actual survival at 10-years, after immunosuppressive therapy is 81.2% in our group. Transformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was not observed in any of our patients. We observed one case with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).
