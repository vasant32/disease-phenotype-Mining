Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome or chondroectodermal dysplasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a variable spectrum of clinical findings. Classical EVC syndrome comprises a tetrad of clinical manifestations of chondrodystrophy, polydactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cardiac defects. In several case reports, dysplasia involving other organs has also been identified. Hematologic abnormalities have been rarely reported in patients with EVC syndrome. Here, we report a case of a 3-year-old Hispanic boy with EVC syndrome and marked dyserythropoiesis. The dyserythropoiesis may be part of an isolated myelodysplastic change or a primary myelodysplastic syndrome and likely represents an unusual EVC syndrome association. To our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported.
