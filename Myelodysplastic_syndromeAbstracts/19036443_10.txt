Few areas concerning the care of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have prompted as much disagreement among clinicians as the appropriate role of iron chelation therapy. At least eight conflicting guidelines or consensus statements on iron management in MDS have been published by medical organizations during the past 6 years. Uncertainties about the clinical importance of iron overload and the necessity for iron chelation in transfusion-requiring patients with MDS have caused confusion for patients. Here, I summarize what we have learned and what we still do not know about the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of iron overload in patients with MDS, including the merits and drawbacks of the oral iron chelator, deferasirox. I also draw parallels between iron and radon with respect to the possibility of biological harm, lack of definitive study results, existence of groups at special risk, and fear that the ongoing uncertainties about these elements incite in patients.
