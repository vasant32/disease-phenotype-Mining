We reported the case of a female in chronic dialysis since 3 years who developed a normocytic a regenerative anemia with no evident etiology. A bone marrow smear revealed a copper deficiency, a rare cause of anemia in general and dialyzed populations. Copper supplementation improved anemia with a decrease in transfusions rate and erythropoietin dosage. This case suggests that a copper deficiency has to be considered when a myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with neurologic symptoms and granulocytes precursors vacuolization identified in bone marrow smear. A blood titration of trace elements should be considered in front of a refractory anemia with no evident etiology.
