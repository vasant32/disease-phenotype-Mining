Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is best performed with an HLA-identical sibling donor (matched related donor, MRD) to reduce the risk of early complications such as acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGvHD). However, as only about 30% of recipients have an MRD for this potentially curative approach, the use of family donors with one or two mismatches in the HLA-antigens (mismatch related donor, MMRD) or fully matched unrelated donors (MUD) (''alternative donors'') has been introduced in the allogeneic SCT setting in recent years. To evaluate the feasibility of allogeneic SCT from alternative donors by using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) we initiated a prospective, phase II study in 1996. From April 1996 to July 1998, 18 patients with various hematological malignancies underwent allogeneic SCT from alternative donors (two patients with MUD and 16 patients with MMRD). All patients received stable engraftment and none of the patients had graft rejection. The rate of aGvHD (grades II-IV) and the relapse rate at last follow-up (seven to nine yr after SCT) were with 40% and 24%, respectively, comparable with those found in patients receiving allogeneic SCT from MRD. However, five yr after allogeneic SCT only 17% were alive, which was mainly due to the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of 59%. We conclude that allogeneic PBSC transplantation by using alternative donors is associated with an unsatisfying long-term TRM rate. The significance of TRM and particular late deaths has to be evaluated further in this transplantation setting.
