Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow have been described as adult stem cells with the ability of extensive self-renewal and clonal expansion, as well as the capacity to differentiate into various tissue types and to modulate the immune system. Some data indicate that leukapheresis products may also contain non-hematopoietic stem cells, as they occur in whole bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, there is still controversy whether MSC expand in the host after transplantation like blood progenitor cells do. Therefore, we were interested in finding out if graft MSC can be detected in leukapheresis products and in bone marrow after BMT and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Every sample from total bone marrow transplants exhibited growth of MSC after in vitro culture, but not one of nine leukapheresis products did. In addition, bone marrow aspirates of 9 patients receiving BMT and of 18 patients after PBSCT were examined for origin of MSC. Almost all MSC samples exhibited a complete host profile, whereas peripheral blood cells were of donor origin. We conclude that even if trace amounts of MSC are co-transplanted during PBSCT or BMT, they do not expand significantly in the host bone marrow.
