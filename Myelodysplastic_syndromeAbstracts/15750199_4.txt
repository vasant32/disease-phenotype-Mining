Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation of myeloid cell precursors. Research has mainly focused on the cellular events, but the bone marrow matrix has attracted minor interest. In this study bone marrow biopsies were obtained from 35 newly diagnosed AML patients. The bone marrows were analyzed regarding the occurrence and distribution of hyaluronan (HYA) and reticulin fibers (type III collagen). The bone marrow sections were analyzed histochemically and compared with bone marrows from 30 healthy controls. The HYA staining was significantly stronger in the AML patients compared with the controls. Only one patient demonstrated abnormal reticulin staining score, but in the group of patients with antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the reticulin staining score was significantly higher compared with the patients with de novo AML. There was a significant correlation between the HYA staining and reticulin staining scores in the AML patients as was seen in the control group.
