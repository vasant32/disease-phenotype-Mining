Although a number of reports have suggested clinical efficacy of low-dose Ara-C (LoDAC) in the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this therapy remains controversial. Clinical trials presently are being conducted to determine the efficacy of LoDAC in these hematologic disorders. Patient education related to self-administration of the agent and monitoring of potential toxicities are primary components of nursing management. It is likely that nurses in acute care, ambulatory, and community settings will be involved in the management of patients receiving this therapy.
