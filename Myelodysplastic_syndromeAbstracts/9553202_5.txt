Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) may be accompanied by systemic mastocytosis. The mechanisms which play a role in the evolution of mastocytosis, however, are not well understood. We report on a case of refractory and anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and co-existing bone marrow mastocytosis. Compact mast cell (MC) infiltrates were detected in bone marrow sections by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to tryptase. In addition, the MC were found to express c-kit, the tyrosine kinase receptor for MGF (mast cell growth factor = stem cell factor, SCF). Activating point mutations in the kinase domain of c-kit (often found in mastocytosis) were not detectable. However, the mononuclear cells (MNC) of the bone marrow expressed mRNA specific for MITF, a transcription factor that regulates expression of c-kit and differentiation of MC. Surprisingly, the c-kit ligand SCF was found to augment expression of MITF mRNA in bone marrow MNC. Whether this augmentation represents a general response (preventing loss of growth factor receptor expression during cell maturation) common to all types of hemopoietic progenitors, or is confined to (some forms of) mastocytosis, remains unknown.
