Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is an adaptor protein that associates with the receptor of erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and thrombopoietin; however, its role is not known in myelodysplasia. We, herein, report a significantly lower IRS2 expression in MDS cells, compared to normal cells. IRS2 expression was reduced in high-risk, compared to low-risk disease, and positively correlated with neutrophil and platelet counts. IRS2 was upregulated during erythroid differentiation of CD34(+) cells from normal donors and low-risk MDS patients and also during erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic differentiation in cell lines. These results suggest that defective IRS2 expression plays a role in the impaired hematopoietic cell differentiation in MDS.
