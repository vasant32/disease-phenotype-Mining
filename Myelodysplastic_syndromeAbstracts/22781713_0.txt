 OBJECTIVE: To explore the frequencies of heterozygosity in X-linked G6PD, P55, BTK, and FHL-1 gene exonic polymorphic loci among Chinese females and the value of determination of hematopoietic clonality by detection of these X-chromosome exonic polymorphisms based on X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP)-transcription-based clonality assays (TCA). METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 446 Chinese healthy females. Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) or PCR-restriction enzyme digestion method was applied for detecting G6PD, P55, BTK and FHL-1 polymorphisms. Those heterozygotic loci were used as markers to examine the hematopoietic clonality of bone marrow mononuclear cells by TCA from essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients with JAK2V617F mutation and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with abnormal karyotype. RESULTS: Among the total 446 genomic DNA samples, the frequencies of heterozygosity in G6PD, P55, BTK and FHL-1 loci were 12.8%, 29.4%, 52.0% and 46.4%, respectively. About 81.4% of females were heterozygous at one or more loci. All 10 ET patients with JAK2V617F mutation and 2 MDS patients with abnormal karyotype, which were heterozygotic in either locus, had monoclonal/oligoclonal hematopoiesis. CONCLUSION: Clonality detection based on X chromosome inactivation patterns-transcription based clonality assays is applicable to about 80% of Chinese females.
