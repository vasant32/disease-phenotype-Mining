 OBJECTIVE: To explore the indication and optimum time for treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with HLA identical sibling grafts. METHODS: From June 1997 to Sep. 2004, a total of 30 patients with MDS were treated with allo-HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors in our institute. On HSCT, 4 patients had refractory anemia (RA) , 2 RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) , 7 RA with excess blasts(RAEB) , 14 RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) , 3 already progressed to secondary AML. For IPSS system, 6 patients were in intermediate- I risk group, 11 in intermediate- li risk group, and 13 in high risk group. The modified BU/CY conditioning regimen was used. Four patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 8 received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) , and 18 received BMT + PBSCT. RESULTS: The 3-year expected overall survival (OS) was 63.61%, 3-year expected disease-free survival ( DFS) 61.41%, and relapse rate 5.26%; OS for RA/ RAS, RAEB and RAEB-t/AML subgroup was 83.33%, 34.29% and 66.67% , respectively, and all had no statistic difference among them. OS for IPSS-intermediate and high risk subgroup was 64.7% , and 69.0% respectively, also had no statistic difference. 3-year expected OS in no aGVHD,grade I - II aGVHD and grade III - IV aGVHD group was 57.75% , 100% and 0% , respectively (P = 0.009). Pre-HSCT chemotherapy, disease subtype and cGVHD all had no correlation with LFS or OS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: For young MDS patients having HLA-identical sibling donors, HSCT should be the first line therapy and performed as soon as possible.
