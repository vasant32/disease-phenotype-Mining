For several haematological malignancies, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice. In most cases an HLA-identical sibling is required. If the mother of a patient is pregnant, cord blood from a related donor, which can be used for stem cell transplantation, might be obtainable in the near future. For the patient, knowledge of the foetal HLA-type can be important since it might influence choice of treatment and timing of transplantation. If the foetus is HLA compatible, as would be the situation in 25% of cases, the delivery has to be arranged in such a way that cord stem cells can be collected. As a result, in the other 75% of cases (spontaneous) delivery can take place in the home/local setting. Here we report four cases in which amniocentesis was performed and HLA-typing influenced treatment of the patient and delivery of the sibling.
