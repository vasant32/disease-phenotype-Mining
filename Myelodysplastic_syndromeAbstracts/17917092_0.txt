We report on cell growth, morphology, and immunocytochemistry of the first human cell line, PC-MDS, derived from a bone marrow of a patient with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome who had no overt leukemia post-MDS phase. This cell population consisted of fast-growing mononuclear cells. Standard cytochemistry methods for detection of MPO, lipids, glycogen and ANAE gave results as follows: MPO and SBB negative while PAS and ANAE positive. Positive cytochemical staining and immunophenotype analyses indicated that PC-MDS cells have some characteristics of the early myeloid precursor cell. As the first t-MDS derived cell line it could be a new tool in evaluation of complex biology of MDS and also serves as a model for diverse in-vitro research.
