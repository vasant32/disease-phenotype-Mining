AIM: To define incidence of HBV infection in patients with blood diseases caused by blood components transfusion; correlation between infection rate and blood disease nosological entity, intensity of hemoreplacement therapy, time of hepatitis B incubation period in patients with hematological malignancies after the diagnosis and initiation of polychemotherapy (PCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2000-2007 a prospective clinicoepidemiological trial was made to detect markers of HBV infection among 303 patients 15 to 76 years of age treated in the department of acute leukemia chemotherapy of N.N. Burdenko Military Hospital for acute lymphoid and myeloblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia in a blastic crisis, myelodysplastic syndrome in blast transformation, lymphoproliferative diseases with bone marrow affection. Statistic processing was performed with standard methods. RESULTS: HBV infection markers were detected in 30 (9.9%) of 303 examinees. Among the infected patients there were 16 (53.4%) patients with different variants of acute myeloblastic leukemia, 12 (40.0%) with different immunophenotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 (3.3%) patient with acute biphenotypical leukemia and 1 (3.3%) with lymphoma/leukemia. HBV infection was registered in patients 2 to 32 months after the beginning of the treatment. Most of the patients - 23 (74%) of 30 - were infected with HBV within the first year after hematological diagnosis and PCT induction course. HBV was diagnosed within treatment year two in 5 (16%) patients and within year three after PCT in 3 (10%). CONCLUSION: High incidence of HBV infection in patients with hematological malignancies points to a high epidemiological risk of hemoreplacement therapy, unsatisfactory quality of donor blood testing and necessity of updating methods of donor infection detection. To lower the risk of HBV infection in patients with hematological malignancies it is necessary to perform vaccine prophylaxis of hepatitis B before PCT.
