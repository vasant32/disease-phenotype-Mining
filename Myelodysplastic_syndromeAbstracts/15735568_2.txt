 BACKGROUND: Infertility after hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST) is a serious problem for young patients. Autologous gamete collection before HST may be a promising strategy to overcome infertility. MATERIAL/METHODS: From October 1988 to December 2003, six male and nine female patients with hematological malignancies had autologous gametes collected before HST. The data on autologous gamete collection were analyzed. RESULTS: Sperm could be collected from three patients. However, in two of the three, the numbers and motility of the sperm were severely depleted because they received chemotherapy for one and 11 cycles, respectively. Normal sperm was only collected from one patient with myelodysplastic syndrome who had no history of receiving chemotherapy. One or more oocytes could be collected in five of nine female patients, although the five received multiple cycles of chemotherapy. The successful oocyte collection was associated with an ovulation stimulant. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous oocye collection before HST may be possible, even if patients receive multiple cycles of chemotherapy. In contrast, autologous sperm collection before HST may be difficult after patients receive chemotherapy. Successful pregnancy using autologous gametes after HST remains extremely difficult, especially in female patients; however, it is important to give information on infertility and autologous gamete collection to patients scheduled for HST.
