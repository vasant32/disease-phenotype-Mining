The combination of fludarabine (FDR), high dose cytarabine and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (FLAG) with or without idarubicin (Ida) was used in the treatment of poor risk acute leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a single centre experience. A total of 105 patients were treated over a 4-year period with 59% achieving a complete remission (CR); no statistical difference observed between FLAG and FLAG-Ida. For patients responding to FLAG +/- Ida, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 11 months and 23% at 5 years. Such patients proceeded either to further chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The median EFS (13 months vs. 8 months) and projected 5-year survival (37% vs. 13%) of patients undergoing HSCT was significantly better than those who did not (P = 0.021). In all, 14 of 72 patients remain alive in continuing CR (median duration 43 months) with 10 of 31 having had a HSCT vs. four of 41 that did not (P = 0.033). Both regimens were well tolerated, with the majority of patients experiencing grade 1 or less non-haematological toxicity (mainly nausea and vomiting). The median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 28 and 31 d, respectively. No significant differences were seen with the addition of ida. There was a 17% incidence of treatment-related deaths, of which 39% was caused by invasive aspergillus infection. The results show that FLAG +/- Ida is an effective and well-tolerated remission induction regimen for poor risk leukaemia and MDS.
