BACKGROUND: Clinical and cytogenetic analyses were performed in 97 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to evaluate risk factors for poor prognosis. METHODS/RESULTS: Among them, 22 patients survived for less than 1 year: 10 of these had complex chromosomal abnormalities (complex aberrations), but only 5 of the remaining 75 patients who survived longer than 12 months did. Leukemia did not develop in approximately half of the patients who died within 1 year. The occurrence rate of leukemic transformation appears to depend on MDS subtypes rather than cytogenetic changes. In contrast, the percentage of patients who survived for less than 1 year is related to chromosomal changes, especially to complex aberrations. Of particular interest in this study is that 7 of 11 patients with MDS who had myelofibrosis survived for less than 1 year, and 5 of 7 patients with secondary MDS were included in this group showing a poor prognosis. By hematologic analysis, significant differences were found in the hemoglobin values and platelet counts of patients who survived for less than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis, three major risk factors for a poor prognosis were identified: complex aberrations, a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy (secondary MDS), and development of myelofibrosis. The survival probability in the patients with MDS having at least one of these three factors was significantly low when compared with that in patients without these factors, indicating that cytogenetic analysis in combination with observance of certain clinical manifestations is important in therapeutic management of patients with MDS.
