A 57-year-old female presented with general fatigue. She had neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data revealed anemia and leukopenia (1,500/microliters) with a differential count of 4.5% leukemic cells. The myelogram revealed 34.4% leukemic cells, of which diameter ranged from 20 to 28 microns. The diagnosis was acute myelogenous leukemia (FAB: M2) with myelodysplasia. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the leukemic cells had chromosome abnormalities involving both diploidy and tetraploidy with structural rearrangement. Structural rearrangement included del(5) (q22q33), del(15) (q22q24), and t(3; 12) (q25;p13). Small dose aclacinomycin-A treatment was effective in reducing the number of leukemic cells in bone marrow, and both anemia and leukocytopenia were improved.
