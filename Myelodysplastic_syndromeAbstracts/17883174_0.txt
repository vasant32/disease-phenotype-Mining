Bone marrow mastocytosis, though infrequently documented in Indian patients, may be observed in association with many non mast cell hematological neoplasms, including acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We report three cases of acute myeloid leukemia with excess of mast cells in the bone marrow (BM) samples. Mast cell hyperplasia may remain under diagnosed due to shortcoming of morphological identification and diagnostic workup.
