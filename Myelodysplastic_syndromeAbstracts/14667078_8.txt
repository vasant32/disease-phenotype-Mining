Kabuki syndrome is a dysmorphogenic syndrome which has been reported in over 300 patients since it was first described in Japan in 1981. In addition to its cardinal features (typical facies, mild-to-moderate learning disability, short stature, skeletal anomalies, and dermatoglyphic abnormalities with persistent foetal fingerpads), neurological anomalies are frequently reported, including epilepsy in 8% of those with the syndrome. We present here a 22-year-old white female patient with refractory partial epilepsy, Kabuki syndrome, and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria on MRI: the first reported case of this association. The aetiology of the syndrome, including the diverse genetic changes recognized, is then discussed.
