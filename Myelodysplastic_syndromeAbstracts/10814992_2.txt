A 28-year-old Japanese woman with suspected essential thrombocythemia (ET) had marked thrombocytosis, mild leukocytosis with normal neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity, and no anemia. She was monitored without being given any medication. Eleven years later, complete blood counts showed no remarkable changes but some non-lobulated mononuclear megakaryocytes were found in the bone marrow. Cytogenetic analysis revealed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-). Subsequently, hemoglobin and platelet counts decreased gradually, splenomegaly appeared and progressed, after which myelofibrosis developed. Acute leukemia developed 16 years after the first documentation of thrombocytosis. 5q- syndrome is known to be a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with unique clinical features and cases with this syndrome presenting with thrombocytosis of more than 1,000 x 10(9)/L but without anemia are rare. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that in this patient transition to acute leukemia occurred following development of myelofibrosis and marked splenomegaly, which are generally observed in blastic crises resulting from chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD). The patient showed features indicative of CMPD rather than of MDS in spite of presenting with 5q- chromosomal abnormality. This case supports the concept of "mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes" and suggests the possibility of the appearance of CMPD-like manifestations in 5q- syndrome.
