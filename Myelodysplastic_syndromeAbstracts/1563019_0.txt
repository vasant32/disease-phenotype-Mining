In this study we analysed the in vitro effect of recombinant interferon gamma on cytotoxic activities mediated by both lymphoid and polymorphonuclear cells from 16 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Our results indicate the inability of interferon to restore the defective natural killer activity, natural killer cells and lectin-induced cytotoxicity. On the contrary we detected a boosting effect on the depressed polymorphonuclear cell cytotoxic activities. In our view, the ability of interferon to potentiate polymorphonuclear cell lytic efficiency could support an alternative defensive pathway against either neoplastic or infectious agents.
