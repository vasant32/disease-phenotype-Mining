Despite the absence of a robust evidence base, there is growing consensus that effective treatment of iron overload leads to decreased morbidity and premature mortality in patients with good prognosis myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Furthermore, new treatment modalities, including disease-modifying therapies (lenalidamide and azacytidine) and reduced intensity conditioning therapies for allogeneic blood stem cell transplants, are offering the prospect of longer survival for patients with traditionally less favourable prognosis MDS, who might also benefit from iron chelation. This article proposes assessment of patients with MDS and related bone marrow failure syndromes to determine suitability for iron chelation. Iron chelation therapy options and monitoring are discussed.
