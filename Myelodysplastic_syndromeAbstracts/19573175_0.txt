We retrospectively investigated 31 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients receiving myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and focused on prognostic factors affecting the long-term outcome. Patients were classified according to the French-American-British classification and the HCT-comorbidity index was determined. Cytosine arabinoside or thiotepa combined with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation was used as myeloablative conditioning in eight and 23 patients respectively. After a follow-up period of 0.8-14.2 years from transplantation (median: 6.4 years), 23 patients were alive in complete remission, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 79% and 72% respectively. The cumulative nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 22% at 5 years. According to multivariate analysis, > or =20% blasts in the bone marrow and an HCT-comorbidity score > or = 3 were significantly associated with poor OS and DFS. Patients with a high HCT-comorbidity score and male patients receiving transplantation from female donors were significantly more likely to have a higher NRM according to the univariate, but not the multivariate analysis. These data suggest that comorbidity and the tumor burden at the time of transplantation may be useful variables for predicting the outcome in MDS patients receiving myeloablative HCT.
