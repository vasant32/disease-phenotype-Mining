Chromosome 1 pericentromeric heterochromatin (1q) has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) results from marrow failure in two or more cell lineages. Although trisomy 1q has been reported in MDS, it is usually present with additional common abnormalities such as trisomy 8, monosomy 5 or monosomy 7, leading to speculation that 1q abnormalities are mostly secondary events representing clonal evolution. We report two cases of MDS in which consistent involvement of 1q heterochromatin is seen as the primary clonal abnormality. Both patients presented with fatigue and pancytopenia. Based on the published reports and our cases, we propose that the 1q heterochromatin plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of MDS. Abnormalities involving 1q result in aberrant heterochromatin/euchromatin junctions, leading to gene dosage abnormalities. Further studies of 1q abnormalities in MDS might provide specific insights as to the exact role of the excess 1q heterochromatin in the etiology of MDS.
