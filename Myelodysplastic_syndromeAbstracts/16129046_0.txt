To study the effect of interleukin-15 (IL-15) on the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of MDS CD34(+) cells, CD34(+) cells of high enrichment were separated by MACS system, and cultured in liquid media with different concentration of IL-15 in treated group and without IL-15 in the control group. Apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors was assayed by propidium iodine staining and cell by FCM, and the other MDS CD34(+) cells were stained by cytochemical staining after culture. The results showed that after culture with IL-15 the proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34(+) cells were obviously promoted. It was found the every lineage of mature cells developed, the expressions of cell surface antigens CD71, CD33 and CD19 all increased in the MDS CD34(+) cell treated with IL-15. It is suggested that IL-15 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34(+) cells, and partly shows anti-apoptosis effects which may be applicable to the therapy MDS.
