Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator in the interferon system and acts as a tumor suppressor. The structurally related IRF-2 represses the effects of IRF-1 by competitive binding to the same DNA sequence elements. Changes in the relative balance between IRF-1 and IRF-2 lead to dysregulation of cell growth and may play a role in the development of neoplasias. The loss of functional IRF-1 has been observed in a number of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia, suggesting a potentially critical role of IRF-1 in leukemogenesis. We studied the expression of both transcription factors in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells of children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) using RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization. No significant difference between the expression levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 could be detected in PB and BM of patients with JMML and normal donors. Although our results are preliminary they suggest that neither the tumor suppressor gene IRF-1 nor the oncogene IRF-2 is involved in the pathogenesis of JMML.
