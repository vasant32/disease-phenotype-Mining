Engraftment in relation to infused CD34+ cell number was retrospectively analysed in 66 patients with hematological diseases: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 33), multiple myeloma (n = 21), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 7), Hodgkin's disease (n = 4) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). Progenitor cells were mobilized with rhG-CSF, alone or in association with chemotherapy. The cells were harvested by leukapheresis until at least 2 x 10(6) CD34+/kg body weight were obtained. A total of 194 leukaphereses were performed (median = 3 per patient, range 1-9). A median of 3.40 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg (range 0.31-27.59) and a median of 7.15 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg (range 1.31-115.70) were transplanted. Regardless of transfusional support or patient diagnosis, engraftment was rapid in patients who had received > or = 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg. In this case, absolute neutrophil blood count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l was obtained on day 12 post graft (range 7-19) and platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/l was also reached after the same median time interval (range 8-121). From the present results, a minimal threshold of 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg appears to be suitable for providing rapid and complete hematopoieitc reconstitution in patients exposed to high doses of chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation. Furthermore, administration of rhG-CSF during post-graft period significantly decreased the neutrophil time recovery (P = 0.002) but not that of platelets (P > 0.05).
