Some patients found to have clonal panmyelopathies develop an acquired defect of haemoglobin synthesis clinically similar to haemoglobin H disease. A 58 year-old male diagnosed of simple refractory anaemia developed microcytosis and hypochromia. At the same time, his myelodysplastic syndrome became a refractory anaemia with excess of blasts. 33% of the red blood cells had "golf ball" inclusions after incubation with brilliant cresyl blue. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis revealed an haemoglobin H band. The globin chain synthesis alpha/beta ratio was 0.69. The molecular analysis demonstrated the integrity of both alpha genes in each chromosome. There were no familiar antecedent of haemoglobinopathy.
