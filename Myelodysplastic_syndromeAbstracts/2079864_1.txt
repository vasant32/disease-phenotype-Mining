In a patient with myelodysplastic syndrom complement fixing IgG1 anti-Ge three weeks after Ge positive serologically compatible blood transfusion was found. The patient and one of his children were Ge-1, -2, -3. Red cells were elliptocytic. The patient's nonconsanguineous wife and other family members were Ge positive. In the red cell membranes of Ge negative persons glycophorin C was lacking. Abnormal glycophorin was present in the red cell membranes of all family members. Anti-Ge appeared to be of no clinical significance. Transfusion of serologically incompatible Ge positive blood provided beneficial effect. After this transfusion anti-Ge disappeared from the serum and was not detected at the whole follow-up, although the patient received Ge positive blood several times. Immunological tolerance towards Ge antigen is suggested.
