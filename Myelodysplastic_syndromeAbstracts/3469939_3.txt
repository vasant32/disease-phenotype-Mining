A patient presented with a myelodysplastic syndrome and bone marrow eosinophilia that evolved six months later into an acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Cytogenetic analyses of the bone marrow revealed 86% of the metaphases with 45,X-Y,inv(16)(p13;q22),t(11;17) (q11;q25),del(21)(q13) and 14% of the metaphases with the same abnormalities but with a Y chromosome. The association of ANLL, bone marrow eosinophilia, and abnormal chromosome 16 has previously been reported and has been suggested to have a favorable prognosis. Our patient is unique in that ANLL was preceded by a preleukemic phase associated with bone marrow eosinophilia. When complete remission was achieved, the bone marrow cytogenetics returned to normal, and the eosinophilia disappeared.
