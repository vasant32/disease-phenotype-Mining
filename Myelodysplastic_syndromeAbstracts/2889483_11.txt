Partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 is a common abnormality in the bone marrow cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). This study was undertaken to characterize the chromosome breakpoints in molecular terms and to determine if hemizygosity or submicroscopic deletions occur in patients without any cytogenetically detectable abnormality of chromosome 7. We studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms with 10 chromosome 7-specific DNA probes in separated WBC fractions. No molecular abnormalities occurred in lymphocyte-derived DNA. Several probes located in band 7q22 or distally thereof detected deletion of one allele in granulocyte-derived DNA from all four patients with chromosome 7 long arm deletion. In the granulocytes of one patient heterozygosity for the T cell receptor beta chain gene (in band 7q35) indicated that the deletion was interstitial. NJ-3, a proalpha2(I)collagen gene probe (in band 7q21-22) detected heterozygosity in the granulocytes of one patient. No hemizygosity or deletions were found in four patients with two normal chromosomes 7. These results confirm that mature granulocytes but not lymphocytes are derived from the abnormal clone. Interstitial deletions exist, and the extent of deleted genomic material varies among patients.
