Chronic exposure to high concentrations of benzene can result in the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Studies of patients occupationally exposed to benzene show a pattern of cytogenetic aberrations involving high frequency of loss of all or part of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 as well as trisomy 8. The pattern of reoccurring chromosome abnormalities associated with the development of leukemia can be used as a guide in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases. Therefore, a research project was designed to determine whether a metabolite of benzene, hydroquinone (HQ), could directly induce loss of chromosome 5 and/or 7 and gain of chromosome 8. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific 5, 7 and 8 probes we demonstrate that 42, 49 and 26 microM HQ induces monosomy 5, 7 and 8, respectively, in the human lymphoblast cell line GM09948. These results demonstrate for the first time that HQ induces a specific chromosome loss found in secondary MDS/AML. The pattern of chromosome 5 and/or 7 loss in benzene-induced MDS/AML is probably due to selective cell survival after HQ exposure rather than specific targeting of HQ for chromosomes 5 or 7.
