A prospective randomised trial was performed in patients given HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for haematological malignancy comparing the combination of cyclosporin and methotrexate (CM) (n = 20) with the combination of cyclosporin, methotrexate and prednisolone (CMP) (n = 21) as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). There was no significant differences between the two arms for the incidence of acute GVHD grades I-IV, acute GVHD grades II-IV, chronic GVHD, interstitial pneumonitis, relapse, survival and disease-free survival. The actuarial incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV in the CMP group was 10% and in the CM group 15% (ns). The incidence of leukaemic relapse in good risk patients was 42% in the CMP group and 40% in the CM group (ns), although the majority of these relapses were cytogenetic relapses only in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV in both arms of the current trial was significantly lower than in our previous trial comparing cyclosporin and methotrexate as single agents. Leukaemic relapse is now the principal cause of treatment failure in this patient population. We conclude that prednisolone should not be included as part of the prophylactic GVHD regime and that further improvement in therapeutic outcome is dependent upon better control of the underlying malignancy.
