A 65-year-old female with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL) developed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), successfully treated with cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC) is reported. Ubenimex, calcitriol and corticosteroid had a minor effect on her MDS. Since she had severe anemia and congestive heart failure on developing leukemia, she was treated with oral administration of SPAC, a cytidine deaminase resistant derivative of Ara-C. After the second course of SPAC (200 mg/day, for 14-28 days), marked erythroid bursts were found and she entered complete remission. The samplings of SPAC and its metabolites of SPAC were investigated in 2 cases including this case, but there seemed to be no relation between their content and effects. In AML patients, especially in cases developed from MDS, SPAC might be useful because it can be given orally even in an outpatient.
