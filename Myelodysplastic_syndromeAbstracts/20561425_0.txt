The aim of this study was to explore the measurement and clinical significance of serum thrombopoietin (TPO) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL). The levels of serum TPO and lactate dehydrogenase in 25 patients with MDS and 40 patients with AL were measured by using sandwich ELISA and velocity methods before chemotherapy, at the stages of bone marrow depression and bone marrow recovery, respectively. The levels of serum TPO and LDH in 15 healthy controls were also measured. The results indicated that the serum TPO and LDH levels in ALL, AML and MDS patients before chemotherapy were significantly higher than those in healthy controls, the differences were statistically significant (q = 7.2943 - 27.4149, p < 0.001). The serum TPO and LDH levels in the patients at the stages of bone marrow depression or bone marrow recovery were significantly lower than those in patients before treatment (q = 7.2943 - 25.9396, p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences as compared with healthy controls (q = 1.4816 - 2.5657, p > 0.05). It is concluded that there is a strong correlation between serum TPO, LDH levels and the status of patients with hematologic malignancies, suggesting that TPO and LDH levels can be used for evaluation of therapeutic effect in hematologic malignancies.
