Panniculitis is an uncommon condition in childhood and may prove difficult to diagnose both clinically and histologically. The clinical spectrum is similar to that in adults and has been associated with many primary diseases. Noninfectious causes are less common in children than in adults. The pathogenesis remains uncertain in a significant number of children. In some it may be a malignant, unremitting disease which can be fatal. We present a boy aged 13 years with panniculitis of the right foot as presenting sign for the ultimate diagnosis myelodysplasia-acute myeloid leukemia. To our knowledge this is the first report on a young boy.
