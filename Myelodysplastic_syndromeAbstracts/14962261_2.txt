A randomised multicentre study was conducted among patients over 65 yr of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to compare oral treatment with etoposide 80 mg/m(2) and thioguanine 100 mg/m(2) twice daily on 5 d and idarubicin 15 mg/m(2) on 3 d (ETI) to a mainly i.v. combination of cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) twice daily on 5 d, idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) x 1, and thioguanine (TAI). Ninety-two patients were enrolled. Their median age was 72 yr, range 65-84 yr. Sixty-five patients had de novo AML, 21 AML subsequent to myelodysplastic syndrome, and six treatment-related AML. They received at first a 6-d i.v. treatment with cytarabine and idarubicin. After the first treatment, 68 patients were randomised to receive two cycles of ETI (n = 36) or TAI (n = 32) and thereafter maintenance with mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Of the 92 patients, 52 (57%) achieved remission at some stage. The median survival was 10 months. There were no significant differences between the patients randomised to ETI or TAI in the remission rate (67% vs. 72%), survival (12 months from randomisation in both arms), event-free survival or relapse rate. The patients randomised to receive ETI spent significantly fewer days at hospital during the two randomised cycles (20 vs. 41 d, P = 0.010), and they had fewer days with infusions, shorter neutropenias and thrombocytopenias and fewer and less severe infections. In conclusion, treatment with oral ETI resulted in a similar antileukaemic effect as obtained with mainly i.v. TAI, with less toxicity and reduced need for hospitalisation.
