This study was aimed to evaluate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome possess immunosuppressive effect. MSCs from bone marrow samples of MDS patients were isolated, cultured and expanded. MSCs were morphologically analyzed and their immunophenotype were determined by flow cytometry. Various amounts of MSCs were added into one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction. MSCs from MDS patients were tested for their ability to suppress in vitro proliferation of autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The results showed that 3 x 10(3 - 1) x 10(5) MSCs from MDS patients could inhibit autologuous PBLs proliferation to (66.9 +/- 20.1)% - (30.2 +/- 5.9)% of maximal response, as well as inhibit allogeneic PBLs proliferation to (56.6 +/- 14.7)% - (20.5% +/- 9.7)% of maximal response, as compared with inhibitory ability of MSCs from healthy donors, there was no significant difference (P>0.05). It is concluded MSCs from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome also possess immunosuppressive activity.
