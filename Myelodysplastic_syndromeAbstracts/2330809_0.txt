Fifty one patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated between September, 1985 and October, 1988 were retrospectively studied. The incidence of cancer was compared with that in the Cancer Registry population of Japan for the same age and sex distribution. In this series, 4 cancers were observed. The risk of cancers developing in patients with MDS was 4.65 times that for an age- and sex-matched population.
