BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of leukemia cutis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is important because these lesions can precede acute peripheral blood or bone marrow transformation. Leukemia cutis is usually easy to recognize, but atypical lesions are not well described. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe unusual specific lesions in MDS. METHODS: Data from patients with myeloid malignancies and leukemia cutis were reviewed. Only patients with MDS and cutaneous lesions different from typical tumors were included. Clinical features were analyzed. RESULTS: Four patients with MDS and unusual specific cutaneous lesions were found. They had ecchymoses, necrotic plaques or ulcers, and prurigo-like lesions. In three of four patients appearance of these skin lesions heralded or was concomitant with acute transformation. CONCLUSION: Specific cutaneous lesions can display unusual patterns. Early biopsy of cutaneous lesions in MDS is indicated.
