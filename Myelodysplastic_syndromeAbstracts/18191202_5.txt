Anemia in MDS with 5q deletion was generally considered, until the advent of lenalidomide, unresponsive to available treatments. We analyzed erythroid response to erythropoetin (EPO) or darbepoetin (DAR) and thalidomide in MDS with 5q deletion treated by French centers (GFM) and in whom karyotype was successfully performed. Of 345 patients treated with EPO or DAR+/-G-CSF, 48 had 5q deletion. The response rate was 46% (31% major, 15% minor) according to International Working Group (IWG) 2000 criteria versus 64% in patients without 5q deletion (p=0.03). According to IWG 2006 criteria, the response rate in patients with 5q deletion was 39% versus 52% in patients without 5q deletion (p=0.10). Mean duration of response was 14 months versus 25 months (IWG 2000) and 13 months versus 27 months (IWG 2006) in 5q deletion and non-5q deletion patients (p=0.019 and 0.003, respectively). Of 120 MDS treated with thalidomide, all of whom had successful cytogenetic analysis, 37% of the 24 patients with 5q deletion responded (IWG 2000 criteria, 20% major, 17% minor) with a mean duration of 9.5 months, versus 32% (18% major, 14% minor) in MDS without 5q deletion and a mean response duration of 9 months (p=NS). Our results confirm that response rates to EPO or DAR and thalidomide are clearly inferior to those obtained with lenalidomide.
