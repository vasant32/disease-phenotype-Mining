Forty patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) preceded by MDS were treated with intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy in a prospective multicenter pilot study. They were given two cycles of cytarabine 100 mg/m with 12-h intervals on days 1-7 and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on days 5-7, both intravenously. Patients who were in remission after these two cycles were given two further cycles of cytarabine on days 1-5 and idarubicin on day 5. No maintenance treatment was given. Eleven out of 19 MDS patients (58%) and 10 out of 21 AML patients (48%), in total 21 out of 40 patients (53%), entered remission. Eight patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The follow-up time was 13-48 (median 33) months. At the time of the analysis, seven patients survived, four patients with MDS all of whom had been treated with bone marrow transplantation (three in continuous remission), and three patients with AML treated with chemotherapy only (two in continuous remission). The median survival of the patients treated with chemotherapy only was 12 months, with the median progression-free survival being 8 months. In view of the poor prognostic factors of the patients, the remission rate was satisfactory, but the responses as well as the survival were short. The post-remission treatment needs to be improved.
