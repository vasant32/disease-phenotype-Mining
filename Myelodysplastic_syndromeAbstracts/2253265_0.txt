The authors analyze data of 259 patients assembled in seven haematological departments by the Czechoslovak cooperative MDS group and compare them with world-wide groups. The mean age of 60 years of our patients is by 5-10 years lower than of groups reported abroad. In our group and in the majority of groups abroad refractory anaemia predominates over "preleukaemic" types of MDS. CMML is obviously a heterogeneous group from the diagnostic aspect. With the exception of CMML there is marked agreement as regards survival of different types of MDS starting with the longest survival of RAS, via RA, RAEB and finally the lowest survival of patients with RAEB-T. The diagnostic classification is thus to a certain extent also the prognosis of the patient with MDS. Transformation into AL (in 22% in our group) belongs to groups with a lower incidence of AL. Nevertheless more than 50% of the patients do not die from AL but from the sequelae of cytopenia. The incidence of secondary MDS (in the authors' group 13% patients, most frequently after mutagens) is mentioned in groups reported abroad only in one quarter of the papers. The incidence of chromosomal aberrations in our group is one of the highest in the world and along with the low average age of our patients is an alarming finding.
