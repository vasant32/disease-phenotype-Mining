The clinical, hematological, and cytogenetical features of six patients with hematological disorders secondary to Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), are described. Three patients developed a dysmyelopoietic syndrome (DMS); three, an acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Chromosomal analyses showed a normal karyotype in one case and an abnormal one in five cases: one with a 53-chromosome clone, two with a pseudodiploid pattern plus hyperdiploid subclones, and two with a hypodiploid pattern. Trisomy 21 was observed in two cases, tetrasomy 21 in one case, monosomy 5 and monosomy 7 in two cases. The correlations of chromosomal changes with hematological abnormalities or clinical aspects are discussed.
