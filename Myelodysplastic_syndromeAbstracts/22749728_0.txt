Sweet's syndrome or acute neutrophilic febrile dermatosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by the appearance of skin lesions produced by a neutrophilic dermal infiltrate, fever and peripheral leukocytosis. It may be associated with hematologic diseases, including leukemia, with immune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, or can occur in isolation. The myelodysplasias are hematological disorders characterized by one or more cytopenias secondary to bone marrow dysfunction. We present the case of a patient with Sweet's syndrome associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and treated with glucocorticoids who did not present a good clinical outcome. We discuss the different treatment of these diseases because in most cases glucocorticoids, which are the treatment of choice in Sweet's syndrome, may be insufficient.
