In order to characterize clinical and biological characteristics of elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we retrospectively analysed 83 elderly patients aged 60 years or more and, as a control, 114 younger patients aged 15 to 59 years who were admitted to our hospital between August 1984 and January 1998. There was a significantly higher incidence of preceding myelodysplastic syndromes in the elderly patients. They also had a significantly higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (loss or partial deletion of chromosome 5 or 7) and a significantly lower incidence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(15:17), t(8:21), or inv(16). With regard to FAB subtypes in de novo AML, the incidence of M3 subtype was significantly lower in the elderly group. Myeloperoxidase positivity of AML cells in the elderly group was lower than that in the younger group. Laboratory data at presentation disclosed a lower peripheral leukemic cell count, a higher fibrinogen level, a lower serum protein level, and a higher serum creatinine level in the elderly group. They also had poorer performance status and more frequent concomitant diseases at presentation, including liver diseases, heart diseases, or documented infections. It was concluded that elderly AML patients 60 years or older had a higher incidence of poor prognostic factors compared to younger patients.
