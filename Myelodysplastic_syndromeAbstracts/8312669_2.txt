Three cases of primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with myelofibrosis were initially diagnosed as refractory anemia by the presence of bicytopenia or pancytopenia and having normo- or hypercellular marrow with dysplastic features. The bone marrow aspiration of these patients showed dry tap a few months after admission, or on admission. Their bone marrow biopsy specimens revealed various grades of increased formation of reticulin fibers. One patient entered into complete remission in response to metenolone, while the other two patients died of cerebral hemorrhage several months after admission. These results indicate that this disease should be classified as a distinct subgroup of MDS.
