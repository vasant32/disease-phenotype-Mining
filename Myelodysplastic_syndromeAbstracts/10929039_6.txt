Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach, we examined the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in relation to chromosomal imbalances in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Two of 26 patients displayed MSI (8%), one of them at five loci. LOH was detected in six out of 26 cases (23%), predominantly involving markers IRF1 [5q31] and WT1 [11p]. Two patients displayed a corresponding chromosomal deletion by conventional cytogenetics. Supporting the mutator phenotype hypothesis, a significant coincidence of LOH, MSI and chromosome abnormalities was observed (P < 0.025). Moreover, our data suggest that LOH represents an initial rather than a secondary genetic event in MDS, promoting genetic instability in a subset of patients.
