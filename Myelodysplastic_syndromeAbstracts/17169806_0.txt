We investigate the role of mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as their downstream scaffold molecules in leukemogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Chinese patients. Genes of interest included FLT3, PDGFRbeta, KDR, CSF2Rbeta, SOCS1, PIAS3 and SHIP. The coding sequence of these genes was analysed by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to search novel mutations. A novel mutation (A > T, Q1154L) of SHIP (1 of 192, 0.52%) was identified and another novel mutation (C > T, R685C) of PDGFRbeta (2 of 192, 1.04%). In addition, FLT3 mutations were seen in three of five patients with AML following myelodysplastic syndrome (60%) and 39 of 268 (14.6%) de novo AML patients (P < 0.05). No mutations were found in the coding sequence regions of KDR, CSF2Rbeta, SOCS1 or PIAS3.
