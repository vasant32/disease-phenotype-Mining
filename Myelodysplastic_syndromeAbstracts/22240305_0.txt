An 84-year-old man presented with the chief complaints of fever and disturbance of consciousness at another hospital. A sheath dilator had been inserted into the urethra instead of an indwelling catheter at the hospital. Since he had previously been treated for myelodysplastic syndrome in our Department of Internal Medicine, he was transferred to our hospital. He presented at our Department with the chief complaints of urinary difficulty and lower abdominal fullness. Kidney-ureter-bladder x-ray and computed tomography revealed the sheath dilator in the uretha and bladder. First, we performed a percutaneous cystostomy under local anesthesia. Second, we utilized optical forceps and successfully removed the sheath dilator transurethrally under intravenous anesthesia.
