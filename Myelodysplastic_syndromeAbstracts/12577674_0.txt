Several reports have documented various forms of glomerular diseases in adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but similar reports in children are lacking. We describe two children with MDS-associated with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome (NS). Patient 1, who had MDS with myelofibrosis, presented also hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, chronic hepatitis, moderate proteinuria, hypocomplementamia and elevated ANA titer. During initial prednisone treatment proteinuria markedly diminished and partial but transient haematological improvement occurred. Relapse subsequently occurred that was manifested by overt NS and pancytopenia. High doses of prednisolone led to remission of the renal disease but haematological remission did not occur. Persisting pancytopenia and repeated infections terminated in sepsis, two years after the onset of MDS. Patient 2, who had refractory anaemia with clonal monosomy 19, manifested bowel disease, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia and non-organic specific autoantibodies. Prednisone led to both clinical and haematological remission. Haematologic disease relapsed 12 months later, when nephrotic-range proteinuria, haematuria and mild azotaemia were also found. Corticosteroid treatment led to long-lasting renal and haematologic remission, maintained by a small dosage of prednisone. In both patients, renal biopsy findings were consistent with those seen in idiopathic NS. A Medline search disclosed 16 cases of glomerulopathy in the course of MDS in adult patients. Clinical features included NS, usually accompanied by renal insufficiency with either acute, chronic, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. On biopsy, membranous nephropathy, crescentic or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and AL amyloidosis, were found. We conclude: (1) that glomerular disease may be present and should be searched for in patients with MDS; (2) that MDS can be added to the list of rare conditions associated with corticosteroid-responsive NS in children.
