This study was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of a dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)-based intravenous formulation of busulphan in the conditioning of 45 patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Busulphan was given as a single daily dose. In 15 patients a single dose of intravenous busulphan, given over 3 h in 1 d, was combined with additional oral (single daily) doses. Thirty patients received all four daily doses intravenously. Busulphan plasma levels were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. There was no major acute toxicity with daily intravenous doses of 2.8-3.1 mg/kg infused over 3 h. No veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was seen in 30 patients receiving busulphan as an intravenous formulation over 4 d. In the group of 15 patients receiving three oral doses and one intravenous single daily dose, one patient experienced mild VOD. Pharmacokinetic samples were taken over at least 2 d of treatment in 44 patients. The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) values normalized for a dose of 1 mg/kg were 7000 ng/ml x h on d 1 and 5890 ng/ml x h on d 4, thus showing a moderate decrease over time. This was accompanied by a moderate increase of the clearance from 2.6 to 3.0 ml/min/kg. Administration of busulphan as a DMSO-based intravenous formulation was well tolerated. The total dose of busulphan can be given in four (rather than the typical 16) doses. With such a regimen, the intravenous administration becomes feasible on an outpatient basis.
