A 19 year old woman presented as a case of haemolytic anaemia due to multi-enzyme deficiency of the erythrocyte. After a transient improvement with folic acid therapy, she developed acute myeloblastic leukaemia. This is the second reported case of a myelodysplastic syndrome presenting with a haemolytic picture and subsequently developing an acute myeloblastic leukaemia.
