Monosomy 21 is a rare acquired karyotypic abnormality associated with myeloid disorders. Occurrence of loss of one chromosome 21 in the background of trisomy 21 in Down syndrome, resulting in the pseudo-normalization of trisomy 21, is a novel finding. The case is described of a patient with Down syndrome who acquired such a genetic abnormality as a result of myelodysplastic syndrome.
