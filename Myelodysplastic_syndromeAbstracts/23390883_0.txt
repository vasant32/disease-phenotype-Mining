SF3B1, located on chromosome 2q33.1, encodes a core component of RNA-splicing machinery, and its mutation has been described in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) characterized with ring sideroblasts (RS). To explore the reliability and sensitivity of the high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) technique for the identification of the SF3B1 mutations, mutations in 92 patients with MDS were detected in this study. The sensitivity could reach 5%, obviously higher than the 25% of direct DNA sequencing. A low frequency (5.4%) of SF3B1 mutations were identified in patients with MDS, including three cases of K700E, one case of H662Q, and one case of K666M. Further, SF3B1 mutations were more frequently recurrent in the 33% of patients with MDS characterized with RS, whereas in other subtypes of MDS, only 2.3% of patients were detected with SF3B1 mutations (p=0.006). In conclusion, a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and high-throughput HRMA assay has been established for the scanning of SF3B1 mutations.
