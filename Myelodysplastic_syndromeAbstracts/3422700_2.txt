Novel techniques were used to detect which cell lineages were affected by monosomy 7 in a patient who had myelodysplastic syndrome and later developed acute leukemia. The patient had had paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria for 20 years before developing refractory anemia with excess of blasts. Cytogenetic analysis at the myelodysplastic stage disclosed monosomy 7 in bone marrow mitoses. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of fractionated white blood cells with the chromosome 7-specific probes MetH and MetD revealed that blood monocytes and most bone marrow erythroblasts but not blood granulocytes or lymphocytes were affected by monosomy 7. The patient later developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia with blast cells positive for markers of the myelomonocytic lineage but negative for granulocytic markers in a standard surface marker analysis. The leukemic blast cells had monosomy 7 as determined by direct cytogenetic investigation. Thus, the monocytes were found to be affected by monosomy 7 in this patient 8 months before her myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myelomonocytic leukemia, and the affected cells had the same biologic markers at both stages of the disease.
