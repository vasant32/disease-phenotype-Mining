The article is concerned with incidence, clinical features, response to therapy, and prognosis of patients with hypocellular myelodysplastic syndromes. Bone marrow (BM) cellularity <30% (or <20% in patients >70 yr) was found in 24 of 236 (10.2%) trephine biopsies. Median age was 61 yr, with significant male predominance (M/F=3.0) At diagnosis, median hemoglobin was 83 g/L, median platelet and neutrofil counts were 31x109/L and 1.2x109/L, respectively. According to FAB classification, 17 patients had RA, 6 had RAEB, and only 1 had RAEB-t. Beside marrow hypoplasia, the most prominent PH finding was megakaryocyte hypoplasia and dysplasia, found in two-thirds of cases, each. Comparison between hypocellular and normo/hypercellular MDS cases regarding clinicopathological features showed younger age, more severe cytopenia, less blood and BM blast infiltration, MK hypoproliferation, and more pronounced stromal reactions in former cases. Karyotypic abnormalities were present in 12.5% hypocellular cases, in contrast to 44.6% normo/hypercellular cases (p=0.0025). Eleven patients were treated with supportive therapy alone, six with danazol or androgens, six with immunosuppressive therapy, and one with LDARAC. However, complete or partial response was achieved in only four patients treated with danazol or androgens. None of the patients developed leukemia. Eleven patients died, so marrow insufficiency was the main cause of death. Median survival was 33 mo for hypocellular MDS, and 19 mo for normo/hypercellular MDS (p=0.09). The results confirm the existence of hypocellular variant of MDS, which seems to have better prognosis than those patients with normo/hypercellular disease.
