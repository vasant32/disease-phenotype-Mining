To evaluate the outcome of a large series of patients who received high-dose treatment (HDT) for follicular lymphoma (FL), 693 patients undergoing HDT (total-body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen: 58%; autologous bone marrow (BM)/peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs): 378/285 patients) were included in the study. A total of 375 patients (54%) developed recurrent lymphoma, 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) being 31%. On multivariate analysis, younger age (P=0.003) and HDT in first complete remission (CR1) (P<0.001) correlated with longer PFS. With a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 330 patients died. Ten-year overall survival (OS) from HDT was 52%. Shorter OS was associated on multivariate analysis with older age (P<0.001), chemoresistant disease (P<0.001), BM+PBPC as source of stem cells (P=0.007) and TBI-containing regimens (P=0.004). Thirty-nine patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML), in 34 cases having received TBI as the conditioning regimen. The 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 9%. On multivariate analysis, older age (P<0.001), refractory disease (P<0.001) and TBI (P=0.04) were associated with a higher NRM. This long follow-up study shows a plateau in the PFS curve, suggesting that a selected group of patients might be cured with HDT. On the downside, TBI-containing regimens are associated with a negative impact on survival.
