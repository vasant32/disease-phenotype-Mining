Four-stem-cell assays, which evaluate megakaryocytic (CFU-Meg), immature and mature erythropoietic (BFU-E, CFU-E), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colony formation, were performed in nine patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The CFU-Meg, BFU-E, and CFU-E colony growths were disturbed more often than the CFU-GM colony formation. A CFU-E increase was not recognized in most MDS patients, but a dose-dependent increase of bone marrow CFU-Es in response to erythropoietin (EPO) was recognized only in two refractory anemia (RA) patients whose CFU-Es were more than one tenth of normal controls. One patient with RA and the other with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), both of whose bone marrow CFU-Es did not increase at the higher dose of EPO in vitro, were treated with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO), resulting in no effects. The responsiveness of patients with MDS to various recombinant hemopoietic factors might be predicted by both the residual degree of bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells and the response of stem cells to the higher doses of each hemopoietic factor.
