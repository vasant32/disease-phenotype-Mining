To study the relationship between the changes in visceral mycoses rates and recently advanced medical care in hematological settings, data on visceral mycosis cases with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that had been reported in the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan in 1989, 1993 and 1997 were analyzed. The frequency rate of visceral mycoses with leukemia and MDS was 27.9% (435/1557) in 1989, 23.0% (319/1388) in 1993 and 22.3% (246/1105) in 1997. In comparing the rate of mycoses in recipients of organ or bone marrow transplantation with that of non-recipients, that of recipients was approximately 10% higher. The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus, at approximately the same rate as in 1989. The rate of candidosis decreased to one-half that of aspergillosis by 1993. Furthermore, severe mycotic infections clearly increased from 58.9% in 1989 to 75.6% in 1997. Among a total of 1000 cases with mycotic infection in those 3 years, acute lymphatic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia were the major diseases (40.6% and 34.8%, respectively), followed by MDS (26.1%). The reasons for increased rates of aspergillosis and of severe mycotic infection can be surmised to be: (i) candidosis had become controllable by prophylaxis and by empiric therapy for mycoses with effective antifungal drugs; (ii) the marketed antifungal drugs were not sufficiently effective against severe infections or Aspergillus infections; and (iii) the number of patients surviving in an immunocompromised state had increased due to developments in chemotherapy and progress in medical care.
