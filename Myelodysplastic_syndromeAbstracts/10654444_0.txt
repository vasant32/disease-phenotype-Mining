We have established a T lymphoid cell line, K2-MDS, from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). K2-MDS cells are positive for the expression of CD4, CD5, CD13, CD25, CD71, CD95, HLA-DR and cytoplasmic CD3. Southern blotting analysis shows T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain genes rearrangements, whereas immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes are not rearranged. Further, the patient PBMC contains TCR beta chain genes rearrangements in the same manner as K2-MDS cells. The data indicate that K2-MDS is a T lymphoid cell line derived from a myelodysplastic clone in the patient PBMC. This new MDS-derived cell line K2-MDS may be a useful in vitro model for studies on the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to MDS.
