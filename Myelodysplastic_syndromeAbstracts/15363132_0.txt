To study the expression and significance of WT1 gene in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL), RT-PCR was applied to monitor WT1 gene expression in 22 patients with MDS and in 69 patients with AL. The results showed that the positive rate of WT1 mRNA in MDS-RA and MDS-RAS was lower than that in MDS-RAEB and MDS-RAEB-t (10% versus 91.7%, P < 0.01). WT1 mRNA could be expressed in all subtype of AL, It was detected in 69% of newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, and in 12.5% patients CR. There was no difference at the relative expression level between newly diagnosed AL patients and relapsed patients, while the relative level of WT1 in MDS-RAEB and MDS-RAEB-t was lower than that in newly diagnosed AL. The CR rate in AML patients with positive expression was lower than that in patients with negative expression (41% versus 78%, P </= 0.05). AML patients with relative level of WT1 mRNA >/= 1 had lower CR rate (18%) than those with relative level < 1 (55%). It is concluded that the expression of WT1 gene in patients with MDS-RAEB and RAEB-t was higher than that in patients with RA and RAS. The detection of WT1 gene may be useful for assessing disease progress of patients with MDS. The expression of WT1 gene and its expression level have associated with the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with AL, that WT1 gene may be an independent prognostic factor in AML.
