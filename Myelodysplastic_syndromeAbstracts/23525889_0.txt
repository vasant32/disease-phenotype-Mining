 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic or splenic lesions in hematologic patients are not defined well because they are not easy to evaluate due to limitations of invasive procedures. Management typically depends on the clinical diagnosis with few microbiological data. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive hematologic patients with hepatic or splenic lesions in the infectious diseases unit from April 2009 to December 2010 at the Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center in Korea. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified. Their mean age was 46.0 Â± 14.7 years, and 16 (61.5%) were male. Underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 15, 57.7%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6, 23.1%). Among the nine nontuberculous infectious lesions, two bacterial, six fungal, and one combined infection were identified. The numbers of confirmed, probable, and possible tuberculosis (TB) cases were one, three, and four, respectively. Two patients had concurrent pulmonary TB. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT, Cellestis Ltd.) was positive in seven cases, among which six were diagnosed with TB. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-GIT were 75% and 81.3%. Nine (34.6%) were defined as noninfectious causes. CONCLUSIONS: Causes of hepatic or splenic lesion in hematologic patients were diverse including TB, non-TB organisms, and noninfectious origins. TB should be considered for patients not responding to antibacterial or antifungal drugs, even in the absence of direct microbiological evidence. QFT-GIT may be useful for a differential diagnosis of hepatosplenic lesions in hematologic patients.
