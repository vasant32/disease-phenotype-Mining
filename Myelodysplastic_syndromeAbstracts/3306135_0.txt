Three recipients of kidney allotransplants developed dysmyeloproliferative syndromes which were fully reversible after switching from azathioprine to cyclosporin A for immunosuppression. Similar bone marrow changes described in the literature progressed to leukemia. Whether the abnormalities observed in our patients could be early stages of the disease described in the literature and whether a fatal development can be prevented by changing the immunosuppressive therapy remains to be elucidated.
