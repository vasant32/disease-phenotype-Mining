We report outcomes of 932 recipients of unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-PBSC HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome enrolled on a prospective National Marrow Donor Program trial from 1999 through 2003. Preparative regimens included myeloablative (MA; N = 611), reduced-intensity (RI; N = 160), and nonmyeloablative (NMA; N = 161). For MA recipients, CD34(+) counts greater than 3.8 x 10(6)/kg improved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, whereas improved overall survival (OS) and reduced transplant-related mortality (TRM) were seen for all preparative regimens when CD34(+) cell doses exceeded 4.5 x 10(6)/kg. Higher infused doses of CD34(+) cell dose did not result in increased rates of either acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of recipients of MA, RI, and NMA approaches were similar (33%, 35%, and 32% OS; 33%, 30%, and 29% DFS, respectively). In summary, recipients of URD-PBSC HCT receiving preparative regimens differing in intensity experienced similar survival. Higher CD34(+) cell doses resulted in more rapid engraftment, less TRM, and better 3-year OS (39% versus 25%, MA, P = .004; 38% versus 21% RI/NMA, P = .004) but did not increase the risk of GVHD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00785525.
