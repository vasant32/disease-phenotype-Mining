Thirty adults with hematologic malignancies at high-risk for relapse were treated on a phase I-II study of high-dose thiotepa, busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) as the preparative regimen for allogeneic marrow transplantation. Cyclosporine and methylprednisolone or anti-CD5 ricin A chain immunoconjugate were used as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Filgrastim was given from day 1 to enhance engraftment. Median follow-up time is 16 months (range 9-29 months). Grades III-IV regimen-related toxicity occurred in 5 (26%) of 19 patients treated with thiotepa 250 mg/m2 x 3, BU 1 mg/kg x 12 and CY 60 mg/kg x 2 and this was considered the maximal tolerated dose-schedule. Stomatitis and hepatoxicity were dose-limiting. All patients engrafted and had complete donor chimerism. The actuarial rate of acute graft-versus-host disease was 71% (95% CI 62-80%). The relapse rate at 1 year was 38% (95% CI 25-50%) and the actuarial survival at 1 year was 30% (95% CI 22-38%). The combination of thiotepa, BU and CY is tolerable as a preparative regimen for allogeneic marrow transplantation.
