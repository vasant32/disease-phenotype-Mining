PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, natural history, and risk factors associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurring as a late complication following autologous bone marrow transplantation for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all 262 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1982 through 1991. Although patients received a variety of treatments before they were eligible for transplant, identical myeloablative therapy (cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d for 2 days plus total-body irradiation twice daily for 3 days) was administered in each case. By collecting data on pretransplant and early posttransplant variables, we attempted to identify risk factors for the development of MDS. RESULTS: The crude overall incidence of posttransplant MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 7.6%. The actuarial risk at 6 years was 18% +/- 9%. The median time of onset was 31 months (range, 10 to 101) after transplant or 69 months (range, 27 to 141) after initial treatment for lymphoma. Pretreatment variables predictive for the development of MDS (univariate analysis) included prolonged interval between initial treatment and the transplant procedure (P = .003), increased duration of exposure to chemotherapy (P = .019) or to alkylating agents (P = .045), and use of radiation therapy (P = .032) or pelvic radiation (P = .003) before transplant. CONCLUSION: MDS is a potential complication of autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; bone marrow stem-cell damage sustained before the transplant may be the most important risk factor.
