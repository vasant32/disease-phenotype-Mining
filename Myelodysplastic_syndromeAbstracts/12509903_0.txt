 OBJECTIVE: To study the origin of aberrant clones with chromosome abnormalities in MDS. METHODS: Antibodies recognizing myeloid cells (CD33), B cells (CD19) and T cells (CD2) were used to sort bone marrow cells of ten MDS patients with chromosome abnormalities (trisomy 8 five cases, trisomy 8 accompanying trisomy 9 one case, trisomy 8 accompanying 7p- one case, 20q- two cases, t (1; 7) one case) by Immuno-Magnetic Bead technique, then the positive cells for CD33, CD19 or CD2 were detected respectively by interphase FISH using the centromeric probes for chromosomes 1, 7and 8, and the locus specific probe for 20q12. 200 to 300 cells were scored for each detection. RESULTS: FISH showed that trisomy 8, t (1; 7) and 20q- all affected CD33 positive cells, but not CD2 positive cells in these ten MDS patients. Only in one MDS patient, 20q- affected the CD19 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the chromosomal aberrations in MDS are mostly restricted to myeloid cell lineages, but B lymphocytes are involved in minor MDS implying that abnormal clone originated from a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor.
