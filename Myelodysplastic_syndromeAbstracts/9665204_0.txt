The nucleophosmin (NPM) gene is involved in two recurrent translocations in hematological malignancies: t(2;5) (p23;q35) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and t(3;5)(q25.1;q34-35) in myelodysplasia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Using eight YACs encompassing the 5q34-q35 region, we could easily detect these two translocations. In both types of translocation, probable unexpected deletions were also discovered downstream of the breakpoint at 5q35.
