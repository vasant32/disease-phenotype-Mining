Eighty-six patients with infections associated with hematological disorders were treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) and amikacin (AMK). Among 71 evaluable cases, 30 cases had acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, 3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 25 malignant lymphoma, and 7 myelodysplastic syndrome as underlying diseases. Excellent responses were obtained in 33 cases (46.5%) and good responses in 14 cases (19.7%), with an overall efficacy rate of 66.2%. The efficacy rate among cases with suspected sepsis was 72.5%. This treatment was also effective in 69.2% of cases in which neutrophil counts were less than 500/microliter through the course of administration. The eradication rate was 83.3% among 6 strains in which Gram-negative rods were detected. Side effects were minimum; skin rash in 1 case, slight elevation of APTT in 3 and slight elevation of total bilirubin in 1. Thus, this combination antibacterial chemotherapy is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of severe infections in patients with hematological disorders.
