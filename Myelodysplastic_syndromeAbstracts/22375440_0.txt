A 36-year-old female developed bone marrow failure diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Sidebar), followed shortly by a peripheral neuropathy and a gait disturbance. While waiting for a bone marrow transplant, she reported to us that she had seen attorney-generated, televised advertisements concerning the role of denture adhesives relating to her malady. Labs were then obtained demonstrating she had dramatic and unsuspected hypocupremia and hyperzincemia. Administration of copper and cessation of denture adhesives resulted in recovery of her hematopoietic system and partial resolution of the neurological sequela.
