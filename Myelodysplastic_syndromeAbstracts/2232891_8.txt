Erythropoietin-dependent regulation of erythropoiesis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was evaluated by measuring the in vitro response of primitive (BFU-E) and relatively mature (CFU-E) erythroid progenitors from 12 patients and from eight healthy donors to recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO), and by quantifying relationships between circulating EPO levels and progenitor cell frequencies in MDS marrow. Half-maximal growth of MDS CFU-E and BFU-E was detected at a 4-fold higher rhEPO concentration than required by control erythroid progenitors. Nine of the patients evaluated exhibited maximal growth of erythroid colonies at 5- to 20-fold higher than control saturating rhEPO concentrations. Circulating EPO levels in MDS patients were elevated, with a mean value approximately 35-fold higher than that of controls. The frequency of MDS marrow CFU-E and BFU-E was 57 +/- 42% and 18 +/- 9% of the mean control values, respectively. Correlation analysis of the relationships between MDS EPO levels and erythroid progenitors indicated that the anemia in MDS is not attributable to an abnormality in the capacity of EPO to induce the generation of CFU-E, but may be influenced by the BFU-E population, whose severe deficiency results in insufficient influx of EPO-responsive cells. Our findings therefore suggest that treatment of MDS patients with rhEPO may be of limited benefit, since the generation of BFU-E from more primitive ancestors and the initial growth requirements of these cells are not under the regulatory influence of this hormone.
