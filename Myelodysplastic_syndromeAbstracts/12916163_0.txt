Platelet aggregation was decreased under action of ADP and collagen in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The decrease in aggregation started from 3-rd minutes and decreased in 4 and 5 minutes after action of ADP. The study of Ca(2+)-ATPase and Na+, K(+)-ATPase membrane activities showed the decrease in Ca(2+)-ATPase and increase in Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity in the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
