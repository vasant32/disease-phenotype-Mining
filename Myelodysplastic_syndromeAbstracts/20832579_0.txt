 BACKGROUND: We examined the relationship between the improved physical activity by early rehabilitation and the duration of hospitalization among patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). METHODS: Thirteen allo-HSCT patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens (group A) and 13 patients with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens (group B) were assessed retrospectively in this study. All patients received physical exercise immediately after neutrophil engraftment at the class 10,000 bioclean room (class 10,000). The mean daily steps at class 10,000 were measured as a substitute for the amount of physical activity, and the duration of hospitalization as one of the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The degree of physical activity showed a negative correlation with the duration of hospitalization in group A (r = -.71; P = .0071), regardless of complications such as acute graft-versus-host disease, infections, and cytomegalovirus reactivation. However, there was no significant association in group B (r = .09; P = .77). CONCLUSION: The improved physical activity through early rehabilitation may be an independent, favorable prognostic factor for allo-HSCT patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens.
