The severity of neutropenia in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has not been completely studied. We analyzed the prognostic significance of severe neutropenia (neutrophils count <0.5×10(9)/L) at diagnosis in 1109 patients with de novo MDS and low/intermediate-1 IPSS included in the Spanish MDS Registry. Severe neutropenia was present at diagnosis in 48 of 1109 (4%). Patients with severe neutropenia were most strongly represented within the groups of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (40%) and refractory anemia with excess of blast type 1 (29%). Severe neutropenia had negative effects on the low/intermediate-1 risk group. A significant difference in overall survival was observed between patients with severe neutropenia (28 months) and patients with a neutrophil count higher than 0.5×10(9)/L (66 months) (p<0.0001). Also, severe neutropenia predicted a significantly reduced on leukemia-free survival (p<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, severe neutropenia retained its independent prognostic influence on overall survival [HR: 2.19, 95% CI (1.41-3.10), p<0.0001] and leukemia free survival [HR: 3.51, 95% CI (1.97-6.26), p<0.0001]. The degree of neutropenia should be considered as additional prognostic factor in low/intermediate-1 IPSS MDS.
