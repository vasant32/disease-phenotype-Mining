A 7-year-old German Shepherd dog was referred for evaluation of severe nonregenerative anemia (PCV, 10%; reticulocyte fraction, 0.2%). Cytologic examination of a bone marrow aspirate indicated erythroid predominance and dyserythropoiesis, and a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with erythroid predominance was made. The dog was given a single blood transfusion and was treated with prednisone and recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). Eight weeks later, anemia had resolved. The dog remained clinically normal 30 months after treatment, with a PCV of 45%. Results suggest that EPO may be useful in the treatment of dogs with MDS with erythroid predominance or erythroleukemia. Additional studies are required to confirm the benefit of EPO to manage MDS-associated anemia in dogs.
