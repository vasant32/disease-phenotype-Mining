Thirty patients (median age of 32 years; range, 6-61) with hematologic disorders received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell transplants from HLA-matched or one-antigen-mismatched related donors following myeloablative therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7), acute myelogenous leukemia (6), chronic myelogenous leukemia (8), myelodysplastic syndrome (3), or other disorders (6). Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were collected from donors in 1 to 3 aphereses. The apheresis products contained mean counts of 11.3 x 10(8) (range, 3.8-17.2) nucleated cells/kg and 6.7 x 10(6) (range, 1.3-16.7) CD34+ cells/kg. Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A plus methotrexate, or FK506 plus methotrexate. All patients received G-CSF following their transplant. Although 1 patient died of pneumonia 6 days after transplantation, the others demonstrated rapid engraftment. Median days to recovery to 500/microliter neutrophils and 20,000/microliter platelets were 13 (range, 8-21) and 14 (range, 1-23) days, respectively. The incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV was 33%; chronic GVHD developed in 57% of the assessable patients. There were no episodes of graft failure or rejection. Nineteen patients (63%) were alive and in complete remission from 147 to 839 days following their transplant (median follow-up of 560 days). Further follow-up study will be required to assess the incidence of chronic GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects.
