20 untreated Hodgkin's disease patients and 1 patient relapsing after radiotherapy (17 stage IIB-IV and 4 stage I-IIA) were given doxorubicin, bleomycin, etoposide and prednisone on a 21-day cycle. The response rate was 95% and 16 patients (76%) achieved complete remission. 4 patients have relapsed 2, 5, 22 and 50 months after treatment. Survival was 100% at a median follow-up of 35 months. However, due to dyspnoea on exertion in 2 patients, bleomycin will be abandoned, and the occurrence of two second malignancies questions the role of etoposide as a leukaemogenic agent.
