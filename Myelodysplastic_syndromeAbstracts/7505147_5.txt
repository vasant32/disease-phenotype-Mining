In an attempt to obtain a synergistic effect on the hemoglobin levels in anaemic patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (epo) were combined in a clinical phase II trial. Twenty-two patients with MDS were included in the study. G-CSF was given alone for six weeks and then in combination with epo for the following twelve weeks. Eight (38%) of 21 evaluable patients showed a significant increase in hemoglobin. One patient with a previous response and subsequent failure to epo alone improved after the addition of G-CSF. Responses were more frequent in patients with less advanced pancytopenia, lower endogenous levels of serum-epo and in those with ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. The response frequency of 38% is higher than in any study of epo as monotherapy. Moreover, patients with ring sideroblasts, who respond poorly to epo alone, showed a response rate of 60%. Our findings suggest a synergistic in vivo effect of granulocyte-CSF and erythropoietin in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
