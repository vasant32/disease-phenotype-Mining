Mir-17-5p and mir-20a, members of the mir-17-92 family, down-regulate E2F1, which is over-expressed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Moreover, let-7a down-regulates KRAS, which is aberrantly expressed in MDS. We evaluated the expression of the aforementioned microRNAs in CD34+ cells of 43 MDS patients using real-time PCR and their target proteins (E2F1, MYC, BCL2, CCND1, and KRAS) by Western blot. Mir-17-5p and mir-20a were under expressed in high risk MDS patients, compared to low risk MDS patients. Similarly, let-7a was under expressed in patients with intermediate or high-risk karyotype. Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between microRNA and the expression levels of their targets. Importantly, mir-17-5p and mir-20a constitute favorable prognostic factors in MDS, since their expression was associated with increased overall survival of MDS patients.
