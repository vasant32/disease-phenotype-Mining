Hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) are considered the best treatment option for many hematological malignancies, and transplant numbers have increased five-fold during the last decade. Only a few controlled prospective studies are available, and different opinions prevail. Data from 118 167 HSCT (36% allogeneic, 64% autologous) collected within the EBMT activity survey from 1990 to 2001 were used to assess trends over time, transplant rates and coefficient of variation (CV) of transplant rates among European countries for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 18.5%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; 12%), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 11.5%), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; 3%), lymphoproliferative disorders (LPS; 36.3%) and multiple myeloma (MM; 18.7%). Transplant rates increased in all countries and for all indications from 1990 to 2001 from 1.7-fold (CML) to 24.8-fold (MM). Transplant rates have declined for CML since 1999. Autologous HSCT are the preferred choice for LPS and MM, allogeneic HSCT for ALL and myeloid malignancies. CVs of less than 50% suggest consensus for allogeneic HSCT in AML, ALL, CML, MDS and NHL, for autologous HSCT in LPS and MM. These data give an overview of the current status of HSCT for hematological malignancies in Europe and provide objective information for health-care providers and patient counselling.
