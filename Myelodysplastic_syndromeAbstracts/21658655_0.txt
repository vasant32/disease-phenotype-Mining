 BACKGROUND: A newly proposed cytogenetic risk classification (NPCRC) has defined four risk groups including favorable, intermediate-1 (Int-1), intermediate-2 (Int-2) and unfavorable. The current study evaluated the prognostic power of the NPCRC in patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2007, 116 MDS patients receiving best supportive care were included in the analysis at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: According to the NPCRC, 3 patients had 5q-,1 patient had 12p-, 3 patients had 20q-, 3 patients had -Y, patient had t(11)(q23), 55 patients were normal, 1 patient had +1q, 1 patient had 3q21/q26-abnormalities, 11 patients had +8, 14 patients had any other single, 8 patients had any other double, 2 patients had -7/7q-, 5 patients had three complex abnormalities, and 8 patients had more than three complex abnormalities. Also, 66 patients (57%) were favorable, 35 (30%) were Int-1, 9 (8%) were Int-2, and 6 (5%) were in the unfavorable subgroup. The median OS times were 23.8, 24.1, 13.0, and 9.1 months in the favorable, Int-1, Int-2 and unfavorable subgroups, respectively (P = .005, between favorable/Int-1 and Int-2/unfavorable risk group, hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.25-3.84). CONCLUSION: In our study, the NPCRC seems to stratify patients according to their risk of death, especially between the unfavorable/Int-2 and Int-1/favorable risk groups.
