This study was aimed to investigate the immunologic characteristics of refractory anemia with excess blasts-II (RAEB-II) which belongs to a new subtype of World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to screen out the independent immunologic prognostic factors of MDS. 35 cases of adult patients with de novo MDS were investigated. The immunofluorescent analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry was performed at the double gating of CD45/SSC to determine the immunophenotype of MDS cells in all cases. All patients were followed up. 47 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M1, 51 cases of AML-M(2) and 38 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were selected as control. Software SPSS 13.0 was applied to analyze all the related data. The results showed that the positive expression rate of HLA-DR in RAEB-II was 100%, which was high in sensitivity and specificity. CD13 (94.74%), CD33 (84.21%) and CD117 (78.95%) were also highly expressed in RAEB-II. CD13 in RAEB-II was significantly higher than that in refractory cytopenia with or without multilineage dysplasia (RA/RCMD) (p < 0.01) and REAB-I (p < 0.05); CD33, CD117 (p < 0.05) and stem cell antigen CD34 (p < 0.01) in RAEB-II were significantly higher than that in RCMD (p < 0.01), but no statistically significant difference was found as compared with RAEB-I (p > 0.05). Compared with AML-M(1) and AML-M(2), no significant difference of CD13 and CD117 in RAEB-II was found (p > 0.05). CD33 (p < 0.01) and CD34 (p < 0.05) were significantly lower than that in AML-M(1), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(2) (p > 0.05); CD15 (p < 0.01) and CD11b (p < 0.05) was significantly lower than that in M(2), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(1) (p > 0.05); MPO was significantly lower than that in AML-M(1) and M(2) (p < 0.05); HLA-DR was significantly higher than that on AML-M(2) (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(1) (p > 0.05). RAEB-II did not express CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD8 (positive rate 0%, p < 0.01) when compared with T-ALL; CD4 (p < 0.05) and CD7 (p < 0.01) were significantly lower than that in T-ALL. RAEB-II did not express CD19 and CD20 (positive rate 0%, p < 0.01) as compared with B-ALL; CD10, CD22 and cCD79a were significantly lower than that in B-ALL (p < 0.05). CD117 (p = 0.0197) and MPO (p = 0.0085) were the two prognostic immunological antigens as regards the overall survival (OS) of MDS; CD117 (p = 0.003) was the single parameter in Cox regression. It is concluded that RAEB-II expresses mainly myeloid antigen without or with little expression of lymphoid antigen. Unique individual immunophenotypic features can be detected in patients with RAEB-II. HLA-DR can be a specific parameter to distinguish the other subtypes of MDS. CD117 may be an independent prognostic immunological antigen as regards OS of MDS.
