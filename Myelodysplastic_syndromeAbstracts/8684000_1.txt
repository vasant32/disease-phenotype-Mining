To evaluate the clinical usefulness of IL-2 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) the in vitro effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on blast cell proliferation, clonogenic activity, cytokine release and cell mediated cytotoxicity were examined in 49 MDS patients. Morphological analyses of bone marrow (BM) cytospin preparations showed a significant decrease in the number of blast cells in MDS after incubation with IL-2. Incubation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) with IL-2 induced a significant increase in the number of CFU-GM in comparison with untreated controls. gamma-IFN and GM-CSF, but not alpha-TNF were found to be released in significant amounts by the BMMNCs cultured with IL-2. No significant differences in the surface phenotypes of fresh lymphocytes were observed between the normal and MDS subjects. After incubation with IL-2, we observed a significant increase in the number of CD3-/CD56+ cells in both normal and MDS subjects. Peripheral blood (PB) and BM NK activity against K562 was significantly greater in MDS after stimulation with IL-2. These data suggest the clinical usefulness of IL-2 in a large subgroup of patients as it may reduce the percentage of blasts and increase clonogenic capacity and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
