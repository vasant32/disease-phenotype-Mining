Clinical efficacy of intravenous gentamicin in combination with oral use of gentamicin, ristomycin and nystatin was studied in 1977. In 1980-1984 two antiinfectious regimens were tested: intravenous administration of gentamicin in combination with total decontamination (oral use of gentamicin and nystatin) and selective decontamination (biseptol with nystatin of amphoglucamine). It was shown that the incidence of severe infections in the patients under the observation dropped against the controls. The incidence and spectrum of infectious complications in cases with acute myelodepressions were proved to depend on the intestinal autoflora inhibition.
