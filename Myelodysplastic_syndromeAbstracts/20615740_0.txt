 OBJECTIVE: Lenalidomide (LDM) is an immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic drug which has been shown to be effective in several haematological disorders (multiple myeloma [MM], myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis [MF] and myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of LDM in our patients. METHOD: Retrospective observational study which included patients at our hospital who were monitored by the haematology unit, diagnosed with MM, MF and MDS and candidates for LDM treatment. Treatment effectiveness was assessed after approximately 4 cycles of treatment. RESULTS: Between February 2007 and March 2008, 16 patients were listed as candidates for receiving treatment with LDM (50% female/50% male, with a mean age of 69.6 years); of these candidates, 3 never initiated treatment. Five of the six patients with MM treated at our hospital obtained some sort of response (83.3%). Of the 4 patients with MF, 2 (66.6%) experienced some sort of response to treatment. Of the 6 patients diagnosed with MDS, treatment was initiated in 3, and it had to be suspended in 2 cases due to different reasons. Treatment only had to be suspended in two of the 13 patients who began it (15.4%) due to adverse effects (AE). CONCLUSION: LDM is well-tolerated and produces sustained clinical benefits, especially in MM and MF. More studies are needed for in-depth examination of treatment duration, new indications and the use of treatments combined with other drugs.
