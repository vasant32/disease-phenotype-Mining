A pregnant 2-year-old alpaca was presented for evaluation of progressive weight loss, decreased appetite and lethargy that developed in winter. Haematologic and serum biochemical analyses revealed marked anaemia, leukopenia, severe hypophosphataemia and mild hypocalcaemia. Evaluation of bone marrow core biopsies and aspirates revealed an increased proportion of immature haematopoietic cells, without sufficient numbers of blast cells to be termed an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 1 The haematological and bone marrow findings were suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The anaemia, leukopenia, lethargy and weight loss remained refractory to medical therapy and the alpaca was euthanased on humane grounds.
