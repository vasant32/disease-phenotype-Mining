Pseudomonas aeruginosa orbital infections have been described very rarely in patients with neutropenia after chemotherapy. We report the case of a woman with the unusual association of Sj√∂gren's disease and myelodysplasia, who suffered from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa orbital phlegmon after chemotherapy for her myelodysplastic syndrome. Partial intestinal antibiotic decontamination with ciprofloxacine did not prevent the infection. She was treated successfully with intravenous ceftazidime, netilmicin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The normalization of the granulocyte count seems to play a crucial role for recovery. We present the clinical and radiological findings, discuss the therapy and review the literature concerning ocular infections due to Pseudomonas. Other infections due to this germ in immunocompromised hosts are briefly reviewed.
