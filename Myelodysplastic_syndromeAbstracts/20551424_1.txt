The 11th biannual report of the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group highlights recently published randomized controlled trials in the field of hemato-oncology that were identified through the continuous systematic search of MEDLINE. For this electronic search, a broad search filter covering all topics in hemato-oncology was combined with a highly sensitive search filter for randomized studies. This report covers publications from February 1, 2009, through August 31, 2009 (including electronic publications). For this 7-month period, 6344 potentially interesting articles were screened to identify 121 controlled clinical trials (randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized clinical trials) of therapeutic interventions in hematologic malignancies.
