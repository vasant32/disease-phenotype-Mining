Ten anemic patients with favorable myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were first treated with two 5-week courses of amifostine alone (each course consisted of 200 mg/m(2) of the drug given intravenously three times a week for 3 weeks), followed by an additional two courses combined with subcutaneous erythropoietin (EPO) (150 U/kg, three times a week for 8 weeks). The study patients either had previously failed to respond to treatment with EPO or had pretreatment serum EPO levels of more than 100 mU/ml. None of the patients experienced a complete or partial response in anemia or other cytopenias. We conclude that amifostine alone or in combination with EPO has limited therapeutic activity in MDS.
