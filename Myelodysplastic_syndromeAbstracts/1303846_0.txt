According to the FAB classification, a patient (case 1) could not be diagnosed as MDS-RA, although she had clinical features of MDS, as compared with another patient (case 2) who was diagnosed as RAS and had abnormal karyotype (20q- and 5q-) of bone marrow (BM) cells. BM cells of the two patients were SCD (sister chromatid differentiation) negative. Rearrangement of c-erbB and c-erbA was found in the genome of the BM cells in both patients, when southern blot hybridization was performed with probe v-erbB+A. Therefore, case 1 could be diagnosed as preleukemia. During a period about 3 years of treatment with the drug stanozolol in case 1 there was good effect and successful reversion was obtained. She had then normal hematologic and cytogenetic patterns of BM and PB and the rearrangement of c-erbB of BM cells also disappeared. She has worked for two years since then. The mechanism of effective treatment and successful reversion was discussed briefly. Probe v-erbB was shown to be useful in investigation of gene diagnosis of preleukemia or MDS (shown elsewhere).
