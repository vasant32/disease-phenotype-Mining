Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome occurring after multi-drug chemotherapy are rare; they are more often associated with the use of alkylating agents. We report the case history of a patient with myelodyspasia occurring after neoadjuvant methotrexate, mitoxantrone and mitomycin C (triple M) chemotherapy with subsequent radiotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. Cytogenetic analysis of a bone marrow biopsy confirmed the typical chromosomal abnormalities associated with therapy related myelodysplasia. Few treatments for this disorder have been found to be of value. The aetiology, incidence and management options are briefly discussed.
