We report the case of an Indonesian patient who required urgent bone marrow transplantation for acute leukaemia and who received successive transplants from two siblings. The first transplant failed while the second was successful. There were some uncertainties in serological typing due to the presence of cross-reacting HLA-B alleles, lack of paternal typing and the use of Caucasoid sera for Indonesian patients. Distinction between the two donors was also difficult. Interestingly, the use of a new DNA technique identified the presence of differences between the patient and the first unsuccessful donor but not the second successful donor.
