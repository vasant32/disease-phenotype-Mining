Epigenetic changes frequently occur in human colorectal cancer. Genomic global hypomethylation, gene promoter region hypermethylation, histone modifications, and alteration of miRNA patterns are major epigenetic changes in colorectal cancer. Loss of imprinting(LOI) is associated with colorectal neoplasia. Folate deficiency may cause colorectal carcinogenesis by inducing gene-specific hypermethylation and genomic global hypomethylation. HDAC inhibitors and demethylating agents have been approved by the FDA for myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia treatment. Non-coding RNA is regarded as another kind of epigenetic marker in colorectal cancer. This review is mainly focused on DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA changes in colorectal cancer.
