The FMS proto-oncogene encodes for the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor expressed on monocytes and B lymphocytes within the peripheral blood system. Allelic loss of the FMS gene occurs in patients with refractory anaemia and the 5q- syndrome associated with the myelodysplastic syndromes. To determine the frequency of FMS gene loss in patients with myeloid malignancy, 50 DNA samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 30 samples from haematologically normal samples were analysed using a quantitative Southern blotting technique. Allelic loss of one allele (hemizygous) was detected in five of 18 samples of AM-M4 and eight of 27 samples of AML M1, M2 and M3. In addition, loss of both FMS alleles (homozygous) was demonstrated in three of 18 samples of AML M4 and 0127 samples of AML M1, M2 and M3. One patient with AML M5 and one with AML M6 were assessed although no allelic loss of FMS was detected. Three samples from patients with secondary AML were also analysed and hemizygous loss was detected in one case. Homozygous or hemizygous loss of FMS was not detected in any of 30 DNA samples isolated from haematologically normal individuals. These data indicate that loss of the FMS gene is common in AML, with an increased frequency in those patients with AML subtype M4.
