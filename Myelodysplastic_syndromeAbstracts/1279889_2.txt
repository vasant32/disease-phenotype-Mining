A morphometric analysis of bone marrow trephine biopsies has been performed to study the frequency and planimetric characteristics of so-called atypical micromegakaryocytes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In addition, an attempt was made to discriminate this particular cell population from small immature elements of megakaryocytopoiesis, such as promegakaryoblasts and megakaryoblasts. The staining reactions employed included periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against platelet glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51-CD61). Comparison of the various staining reactions applied to the different megakaryocytic elements together with morphometric measurements resulted in a clearcut identification of promegakaryoblasts. These were defined as the earliest immature and exclusively CD61-positive precursors. Atypical micromegakaryocytes were characterized by their dysplastic features and strong ANAE reactivity in addition to their positive CD61 staining. When stringent diagnostic criteria (diameter ranging between 10 to 15 microns, mean size about 12 microns) were applied, this abnormal cell population comprised less than 10% of total megakaryocytopoiesis in CML and MDS. It may be assumed that dysmegakaryocytic features in the latter disorders are partially generated by small to medium-sized megakaryocytes (diameter less than 30 microns). In conclusion, the relative frequency of promegakaryoblasts in the normal bone marrow (range 6-8%) is confirmed by evaluation of the immunohistochemical and cytochemical staining methods (CD61 and ANAE). Furthermore, the ANAE reaction facilitates the recognition of atypical micromegakaryocytes as well as small megakaryocytes. Thus cytochemistry provides a better insight into alterations of these cell lineages in various pathological conditions.
