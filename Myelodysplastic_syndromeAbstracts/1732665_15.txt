In a retrospective and prospective follow-up study from 1975 to 1991, bone marrow biopsies, aspirates and clinical features of 495 patients with MDS were investigated. Sections of undecalcified plastic embedded biopsies and smears of bone marrow aspirates were stained according to Giemsa. Bone marrows with MDS were characterized by three main categories of morphologic alterations: (1) cellular abnormalities, (2) architectural disorganization in the bone marrow and (3) stromal changes; the combined use of aspirates and trephine biopsies enabled a more reliable and accurate diagnosis of MDS than either one alone. The bone marrow findings fell into one of 7 subtypes, with the frequencies and median survivals in brackets: (1) MDS sideroblastic (19%, 62 months), (2) MDS megaloblastoid (13%, 56 months), (3) MDS proliferative (22%, 31 months), (4) MDS blastic (15%, 9 months), (5) MDS hypoplastic (15%, 26 months), (6) MDS fibrotic (6%, 29 months), and (7) MDS inflammatory (10%, 42 months). In follow-up studies patients with secondary MDS were excluded and the prognosis and subsequent evolution for each of the morphologic subtypes were evaluated. The conclusion is drawn that aspirates and trephine biopsies are complementary procedures and both are required for diagnosis, classification and decisions on current treatment modalities of patients with MDS.
