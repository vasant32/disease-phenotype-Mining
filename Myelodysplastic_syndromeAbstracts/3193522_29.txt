A program for the management of neurogenic bladder in patients with myelodysplasia was instituted in July 1983. Of the 114 patients entered into the program who have been followed for a minimum of 18 months 42 per cent required treatment for high intravesical pressures. None of this group or the larger group with low bladder pressures showed progressive upper urinary tract deterioration. In 8 children (17 per cent of those with high pressure bladder dysfunction) high intravesical pressure persisted despite anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization, and they required an operation to achieve a low pressure bladder. These results confirm the findings in other studies that about 40 per cent of myelodysplastic children are at high risk for the development of upper tract changes, and that approximately 6 to 8 per cent will not respond sufficiently to anticholinergic agents and intermittent catheterization.
