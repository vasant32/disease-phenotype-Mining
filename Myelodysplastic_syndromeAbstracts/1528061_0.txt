A method was devised to grow haemopoietic cells in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) which requires only 1 x 10(6) cells/culture. Such miniature cultures were used to study growth patterns of marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Consistent differences in LTBMC cellularity and cellular composition were noted between MDS and normal marrow. These differences were accentuated by rGM-CSF. The criteria which distinguished between and MDS marrows were: cell count at weeks 1 and 4, % neutrophils and % blasts. In 10 patients with unexplained macrocytosis or pancytopenia miniature LTBMC results clearly segregated into either 'normal' or 'MDS' growth patterns. Miniature LTBMC with rGM-CSF may therefore be a useful diagnostic test for early MDS.
