Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal instability syndrome characterized by bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Eight FA proteins associate in a nuclear core complex to monoubiquitinate FANCD2/FANCI in response to DNA damage. Additional functions have been described for some of the core complex proteins; however, in vivo genetic proof has been lacking. Here we show that double-mutant Fancc(-/-);Fancg(-/-) mice develop spontaneous hematologic sequelae including bone marrow failure, AML, MDS and complex random chromosomal abnormalities that the single-mutant mice do not. This genetic model provides evidence for unique core complex protein function independent of their ability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2/FANCI. Importantly, this model closely recapitulates the phenotypes found in FA patients and may be useful as a preclinical platform to evaluate the molecular pathogenesis of spontaneous bone marrow failure, MDS and AML in FA.
