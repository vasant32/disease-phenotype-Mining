Remicade, a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing tumor necrosis factor alpha was given to 37 low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients in two cohorts; 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 4 cycles. Median age was 68 years, 33 had primary MDS, 14 had refractory anemia (RA), 14 RA with ringed sideroblasts, 9 RA with excess blasts. Nine patients stopped therapy prior to completing 4 cycles, 3 from cohort 1 and 6 from cohort 2 and response was evaluated using the International Working Group criteria in 28 patients who completed the 4 cycles. Six patients showed disease progression, 14 had stable disease and 8 showed hematologic responses, 3/15 (20%) in cohort 1 and 5/13 (38%) in cohort 2. Two patients had multi-lineage responses, 2 had > 100% increase in absolute neutrophils, 1 had > 1 gm/dl increase in hemoglobin, 1 had reduction in blasts from 7% to 1%, and 2 had minor cytogenetic responses (> 50% reduction in + 8 and 20q-metaphases respectively). We conclude that Remicade may have a variety of activities in low risk MDS patients, is well tolerated with a high patient compliance, and may be considered for combination therapy in the future.
