Current treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is unsatisfactory. Very recently, immunosuppressive treatment strategies have been gaining interest. We report a patient with transfusion-dependent MDS who achieved significant hematopoietic improvement following cyclosporine (CsA) therapy and who is now transfusion independent for more than 5 years. This single observation supports the view that CsA, among other immunosuppressive agents, could play an important role in future treatment concepts in MDS and may lead to clinically relevant and sustained improvement of hematopoiesis in a subset of patients.
