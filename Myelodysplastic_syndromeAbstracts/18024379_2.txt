Copper deficiency is an etiology of anemia, neutropenia, and bone marrow dysplasia that may be under-recognized. We report 5 patients with clinical presentation consistent with MDS who were found to be deficient in copper and whose hematologic abnormalities resolved with copper supplementation. We recommend copper level assessment in patients suspected of having low-risk MDS, especially those with gastrointestinal disorders and neuropathy.
