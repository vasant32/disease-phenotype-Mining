Findings in epigenetic changes in meylodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and the development of demethylating drugs provide a new approach to the treatment of MDS. We used standard-dose decitabine for treatment of MDS in an elderly patient with an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of moderate risk group 2, and achieved a complete response in the first course. We report our experience with this case and review the relevant literatures.
