Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) are stem cell disorders. There is no clear-cut demarcation of them. Hypoplastic MDS displays features of aplastic anemia and MDS, on the other side mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS-MPS) develop. In our collection of 566 MDS patients, features of myelodysplasia as well as myeloproliferation, MDS-MPS, were present in 25 patients (4.4%). Twelve patients had at the time of diagnosis megakaryocytic proliferation and thrombocythemia beside signs of MDS, and seven had myelodysplasia with granulocytic proliferation and leukocytosis. In another six patients, MDS was the first diagnosis and the proliferative phase developed later during the course of the disease. These patients can be characterized as MDS-MPS in evolution. All subjects had a variable degree of anemia. While the level of thrombocythemia has been relatively stable, the number of leukocytes has been progressive, but rarely extended beyond 100 x 10(9)/l. Ring-sideroblasts and myelofibrosis were frequent findings. Two more homogeneous MDS-MPS groups emerged in our analysis: sideroblastic anemia with thrombocythemia and a group fulfilling the criteria of Philadelphia chromosome negative and bcr-abl negative "atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)'. One patient with thrombocythemia and three with leukocytosis (23%) transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Men prevailed (12/13) in patients with leukocytosis and MDS-MPS in evolution. Of the 46% MDS-MPS patients with chromosomal aberrations, del(20)(q) is of interest.
