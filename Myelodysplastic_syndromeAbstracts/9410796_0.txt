We describe the case of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) classified as Refractory Anemia with our Excess blasts, who suffered from high transfusional requirements and who did not respond to the administrations of B12 vitamin, folates, danazol, low dose cytarabine or recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). The patient was administered two cytokines: granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed by rHuEPO. The patient remained transfusion free for more than 4 months until his death from causes not related to MDS or the therapy he received. It is the opinion of the authors that the initial G-CSF administration stimulated the early erythroid precursors, making them capable of finishing their maturation when rHuEPO was administered. We believe that this could be a useful therapeutic measure in the treatment of patients with MDS and high transfusional requirements.
