Cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were used concomitantly to treat infections complicated by hematological diseases. A total of 103 subjects were evaluated, and the all over efficacy rate was 69.9%. Acute leukemia was found in the largest number of patient, 57, followed by 29 cases of malignant lymphoma and 7 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome. By type of infection, patients having unknown origin were the largest in number, being 66, and the efficacy rate was 71.2%. The efficacy rates for sepsis, pneumonia and upper respiratory infection were 42.9% (7 cases), 71.4% (14 cases) and 90% (10 cases) respectively. The efficacy rates by neutrophil counts before administration of CZOP and AMK and at 1 week after administration were both 53.3% in the group of less than 100/microliter, both 60% in the group of less than 500/microliter. The efficacy rate by neutrophil counts at 1 week after administration was 58.6% in the group of less than 100/microliter. The efficacy rate was 75.4% in the group of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) concomitant usage, and 61.9% in the group of non-concomitant usage group. The efficacy rates by serum albumin levels before administration of CZOP and AMK and at 1 week after administration were both 92.9% in the group of over than 4 g/dl, both 50% in the group of less than 3 g/dl. Concomitant treatment with CZOP and AMK exhibited a high level of safety and efficacy rates in infections complicated by hematological diseases.
