Clinical and haematological features of 13 patients with secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were studied, MDS developed subsequent to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for various haematological or non-haematological diseases. In six cases, the first sign was a persistently increased mean cell volume (MCV) and a macrocytosis preceding from 6 to 18 months the appearance of severe anaemia or acute leukaemia. In five cases, the initial finding was a macrocytic anaemia. Dysmyelopoiesis was a constant and prominent feature of the bone marrow smears at some time during the course of the disease. Two cases without macrocytosis at any time directly developed overt acute leukaemia.
