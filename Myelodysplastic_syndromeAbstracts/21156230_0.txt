Carbohydrate N-acetylgalactosamine 4-0 sulfotransferase 9 (CHST9) belongs to the N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4ST) family. A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNV) of the region encompassing CHST9 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. Most of the current studies, however, focused on the genome-wide screening of CNV, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amounts of clinical samples. In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of hematologic malignancies, as well as healthy controls, and detected the CNV of CHST9 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found significant association between the CNV of CHST9 and these hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. We also examined CHST9 mRNA expression in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In general, the CNV of CHST9 have been shown to associate with hematologic malignancies. The functional consequences of CNV, however, need to be investigated extensively in the future.
