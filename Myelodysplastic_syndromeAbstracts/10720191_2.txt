A 1-year-old spayed domestic short-haired cat was referred with anorexia and weight loss. Hematologic findings indicated nonregenerative anemia, severe neutropenia and monocytosis. The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen test was positive reaction by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dysgranulopoiesis with slight increase in blast cells were observed in bone marrow smears. On the basis of blood and bone marrow findings, the cat was diagnosed as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), which possibly corresponds to a kind of the subtypes in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
