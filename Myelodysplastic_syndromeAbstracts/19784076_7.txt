Cytogenetics is an important prognostic factor for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, existing cytogenetics grouping schemes are based on patients treated with supportive care, and may not be optimal for patients undergoing allo-SCT. We proposed earlier an SCT-specific cytogenetics grouping scheme for patients with MDS and AML arising from MDS, based on an analysis of patients transplanted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital. Under this scheme, abnormalities of chromosome 7 and complex karyotype are considered adverse risk, whereas all others are considered standard risk. In this retrospective study, we validated this scheme on an independent multicenter cohort of 546 patients. Adverse cytogenetics was the strongest prognostic factor for outcome in this cohort. The 4-year relapse-free survival and OS were 42 and 46%, respectively, in the standard-risk group, vs 21 and 23% in the adverse group (P<0.0001 for both comparisons). This grouping scheme retained its prognostic significance irrespective of patient age, disease type, earlier leukemogenic therapy and conditioning intensity. Therapy-related disease was not associated with increased mortality in this cohort, after taking cytogenetics into account. We propose that this SCT-specific cytogenetics grouping scheme be used for patients with MDS or AML arising from MDS who are considering or undergoing SCT.
