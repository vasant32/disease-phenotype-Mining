Between 1989 and 1999, 36 cases with primary myelodysplastic syndromes were diagnosed. They were 15 male and 21 females, the median age was 62 years (range: 22 to 90 years). Eighty one per cent of patients were presented symptoms of anemia. Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and skin manifestations were noted in 25% of cases. Hemogram showed anemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia respectively in 97%, 44% and 55% of cases. Refractory anemia with excess blasts (AREB) is the most frequent FAB subtypes of MDS (17 cases). Cytogenetic study concerned 24 patients. In 13 cases the karyotype was pathological with deletion 5 q in 64% of cases. Seventeen patients have received a chemotherapy. Survival rate to 36 months is 11%. At the time, the only curative treatment is the bone marrow transplantation, which is proposed to young patients with HLA identical donor.
