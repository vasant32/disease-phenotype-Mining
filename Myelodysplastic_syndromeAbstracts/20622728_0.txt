Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the same patient is extremely rare. We describe a 69-year-old CLL patient who developed MDS with ring sideroblasts 1 year after diagnosis of CLL and without any previous treatment. Diagnosis was based on flow cytometry, bone marrow aspirate morphology, and iron stain. Our findings indicate that the 2 disorders belong to 2 different hematopoietic clones in this patient. In cases of worsening anemia in CLL patients, it is recommended that an iron stain be performed on bone marrow aspirates to exclude a coexistent malignancy such as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.
