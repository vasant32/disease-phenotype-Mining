 OBJECTIVE: Live-attenuated varicella vaccine is effective and safe in immunocompetent children. In this study, we assess the immunogenicity and adverse events following varicella vaccination in immunosuppressed cancer children. METHODS: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-seronegative cancer children received two doses of live-attenuated VZV vaccine (Varilrix) in a span of 3 months. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were in the maintenance phase of chemotherapy, whereas those with solid tumours joined the study around 3-6 months from treatment discontinuation. VZV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses were measured before and after VZV vaccination. RESULTS: The median (range) age of the 17 patients was 4.4 yr (2.0-14.5). Thirteen had ALL, one had myelodysplastic syndrome and three had solid tumours. Following vaccination, the VZV-specific stimulation index (SI) increased from 1.7 (0.9-2.9) to 17.9 (5.9-36.0) (P < 0.001). Similarly, SI to phytohaemagglutinin mitogen increased from 1136 (499-1930) to 1714 (848-2518) (P = 0.028). There were also significant increases in CD4+ cells and CD4:CD8 ratio as well as a reduction in CD16/56+ cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Seroconversion rate to VZV was 19% after one dose and increased to 94% after the second dose of VZV vaccine. Serum VZV-specific IgG concentrations also increased significantly following two doses when compared with one dose of VZV vaccine (P = 0.0004). One subject developed possibly vaccine-related chickenpox with self-limiting hepatitis at 5 wk following vaccination. None of the patients developed herpes-zoster at a median (range) follow-up of 27.5 months (24.0-30.0). CONCLUSIONS: Non-immune cancer children can be effectively vaccinated against chickenpox at the defined period. However, the safety of chickenpox vaccine in these immunosuppressed children needs to be further studied.
