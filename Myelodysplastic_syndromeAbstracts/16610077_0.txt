 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of WT1 gene in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to explore its clinical implications. METHODS: Expression of WT1 mRNA was detected in 53 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 10 healthy subjects by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULT: WT1 gene was expressed in all MDS patients. The positive rate and expression level in MDS patients were higher than those in healthy subjects. The positive rates of WT1 expression in MDS-RAEB and MDS-RAEB-t groups were higher than those in MDS-RA and MDS-RAS groups. The expression level was gradually increased from MDS-RA and MDS-RAS groups to MDS-RAEB and MDS-RAEB-t groups. CONCLUSION: The expression of WT1 gene might be associated with the development of MDS, and it can be used for risk assessment and monitor of disease progression and therapeutic effects in MDS patients.
