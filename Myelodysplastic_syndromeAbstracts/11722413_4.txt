We describe a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that transformed to Burkitt's acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The leukaemic blasts were negative for peroxidase staining, and expressed CD10, CD19, CD22, CD38, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and surface immunoglobulin (sIg) M, but neither sIgD nor sIgG were expressed. Chromosomal study during the ALL phase showed t(8;22)(q24;q11) in addition to the karyotypes determined during the MDS phase. Furthermore, overexpression of c-myc mRNA was confirmed in ALL blasts. These findings indicate that MDS transformed to Burkitt's ALL through multiple cytogenetic evolutions, the final event of which seems to be overexpression of the c-myc gene.
