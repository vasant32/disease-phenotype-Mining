A 19-year-old male with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission received a bone marrow transplant from a HLA-matched donor. Because of major incompatibility for ABO blood type, bone marrow mononuclear cells of the donor were infused after conditioning including total body irradiation (TBI). Engraftment was confirmed on day +23. On day +91, recipient ABO blood genotype was detected in burst forming-unit erythroid (BFU-E) using polymerase chain reaction. Thereafter, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of recipient origin rapidly developed and progressed into a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like disorder. An association between MDS and TBI is suggested.
