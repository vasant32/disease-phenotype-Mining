The cooperative group included 18 provincial and district hospitals. A retrospective study was carried out on 140 cases of therapy related leukemia (TRL) caused by bimolane (BML) for psoriasis from 1984 to 1992. This series of BML-TRL consists of 90 male and 50 female patients. 87.1% of them were from 20 to 50 years old. Annual incidence varied from 4 to 24 cases, and was maintained at this level through the period from 1986 to 1991 without any declining tendency. The average time interval between BML administration and diagnosis of leukemia was 46 months. 138 cases were diagnosed as ANLL and 2 cases were suspected of having ALL. Subtype frequency was shown as follows: M3 > M2 > M5 > M4 > M1 > M6. 67.1% of the patients had a low peripheral white blood cell counts (< 5 x 10(9)/L). 116 patients received chemotherapy. A 26.7% remission rate was obtained with 18.1% complete remission and 8.6% partial remission. A 115 day median survival was calculated through a follow up survey of 95 patients. Finally, we concluded that: (1) This has been the largest group of non-cancer-therapy-related-leukemia patients ever reported. This type of leukemia is characterized by a shorter latent period, higher remission rate less incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome and more frequent occurrence of leukopenia, as compared with other types of TRL. BML is supposed to be a strong leukemia-causing cytotoxic agent. Use of this drug in psoriasis and other benign diseases is not recommended.
