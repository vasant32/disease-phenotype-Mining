Eighteen patients (pts) with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with thymopentin (TP) (50 mg subcutaneously for 5 days) and recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN alpha 2a) (3 MU/m2 subcutaneously on the sixth day); the courses were delivered every week. Moreover those pts with > or = 10% blasts in the bone marrow were additionally treated with low dose cytosine arabinoside (LDARAc) (20 mg standard dose, subcutaneously, twice a day for seven days every four weeks). Sixteen pts were finally assessable for response. Seven pts (44%) were classified as good responders, 5 (31%) had a PR; the overall response rate (GR+PR) was 75%. Two pts (12.5%) showed stable disease and the 2 remaining (12.5%) had progressive disease. Six pts with an initial moderate anemia never required supportive care before and during the therapy; in contrast to 10 pts who were transfusion-dependent. After six months of therapy 2 pts decreased their transfusional needs by 50% (1 of them did not receive any transfusion over the following six months of therapy); 2 pts needed no packed red cell infusions and 1 pt decreased his transfusional support by 75%. Five pts kept an unchanged supportive care load. The overall median survival was 12.5 months. Therapy was generally well tolerated with acceptable compliance; the most frequently recorded side effects were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 2-3 among the group receiving LDARAc. However no life-threatening infectious episodes or bleeding were observed. TP, rIFN alpha 2a and LDARAc can be safely administered on an outpatient basis to MDS pts and appears to have significant activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
