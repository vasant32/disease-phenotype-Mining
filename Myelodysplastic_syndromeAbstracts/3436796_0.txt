Thirty-five patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were retrospectively classified according to the FAB classification (French-American-British Cooperative Study Group). Their prognosis was found to be dependent mainly on the presence of blasts in bone marrow examination. Those with an excess of blasts in their bone marrow had a median survival of 30 months in contrast to 66 months in those without blasts. These results were compared with those of seven recent reported series.
