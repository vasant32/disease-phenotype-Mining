Interferon-alpha has been used as a differentiating agent in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with conflicting results and often significant toxicity. In order to maximize the differentiating effects of this agent and minimize the myelosuppressive effects, a prospective pilot study was initiated utilizing interferon alpha-2a (Roferon A, Roche Laboratories) in the treatment of complicated or poor prognosis myelodysplasia. The study regimen utilized 'mini-dose' interferon alpha-2a at 1 x 10(6) units subcutaneously three-times per week for 16 weeks followed by an 8 week observation period. Nine patients were enrolled between May 1990 and June 1991, of which seven are evaluable. Forty-three percent (3/7) had a partial or clinical response as defined by normalization of one or more of the hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, or platelet count, or a decrease in transfusion requirement by > or = 50%. Only one patient was removed from study for interferon-associated toxicity. Mini-dose interferon alpha-2a appears to be an effective regimen for some patients with myelodysplasia which can be administered with minimal toxicity. Further investigation with interferon-alpha for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, at the dosage utilized in this study, is warranted.
