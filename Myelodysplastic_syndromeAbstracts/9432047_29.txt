Nineteen patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) received fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and idarubicin chemotherapy (de novo MDS/MDS-AML, nine; relapsed/refractory MDS/AML, seven; therapy-related MDS, three). Median age was 44 years and median disease duration 10 months. 16/19 (84%) patients had abnormal cytogenetics with seven (37%) harbouring abnormalities of chromosome 7. 18/19 (94.7%) patients responded to FLAG-idarubicin with 12 (63%) achieving complete remission (CR) (< 5% blasts and normal cytogenetics). 7/9 (78%) patients with de novo MDS/MDS-AML achieved CR compared to 5/10 (50%) with alternative diagnoses. Response was associated with age < 50 years, disease duration < 3 months, and cytogenetics other than abnormalities of chromosome 7. Haemopoietic regeneration was rapid in most patients and there were no toxic deaths. Nine patients received a second course of chemotherapy, three have proceeded to allogeneic bone marrow transplant and three to autologous blood stem cell/bone marrow transplantation. Follow-up is short (median 10 months). 12/19 (63%) patients remain alive and 5/12 (42%) have relapsed at a median 5 months following CR achievement. FLAG-idarubicin was well tolerated. High rates of morphological and cytogenetic remission, especially in de novo MDS, offer a window of opportunity for assessment of autologous BMT in this group of diseases where no treatment except alloBMT has led to prolongation of survival.
