We report a t(8;12)(q12; p13) as the sole cytogenetic anomaly in a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). By means of FISH, we mapped the genomic region involved in the breakpoint (bkp) on both chromosomes. The 12p13 bkp mapped between markers WI-664 and WI-9218, immediately distal to the breakpoint cluster region frequently involved in hematological neoplasms targeted by y964C10. The 8q12 bkp (not yet investigated by FISH) was characterized and found to occur between markers WI-3263 and D8S524 within the region recognized by y874E10.
