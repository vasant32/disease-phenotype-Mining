Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes involving various cartilages. The clinical course of RP is variable, and dermatologic manifestations are uncommon. We report a 73-year-old patient who presented with a neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) as the initial manifestation of RP. There was no evidence for a myelodysplastic syndrome, as it has been previously reported with RP, but the patient was followed-up for an indolent and untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Complete remission was obtained with oral corticosteroids. This report highlights the clinical spectrum of the RP.
