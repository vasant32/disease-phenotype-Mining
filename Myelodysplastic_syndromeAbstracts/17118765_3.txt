Secondary clonal hemaloiogical disease in donor cells has rarely been reported as a complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in hematological disease. We report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome that showed cytogenetic abnormalities of t(2;3) and monosomy 7, which developed 2 years after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for aplastic anemia and 1 year after liver transplantation for drug-induced hepatic failure. This secondary malignancy of donor origin is most frequently seen in patients with leukemia. We suspect that the chromosomal abnormalities are related to hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin for posttransplantion pancytopenia, and repeated infections after liver transplantation.
