BACKGROUND: To systematically evaluate the bone status, searching for osteoporosis in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study from March 1997 to June 2000, we included all new patients examined for cutaneous signs of mastocytosis. Past history, physical examination, skin biopsy, laboratory tests, bone densitometry, cytology and histopathology of bone marrow and other complementary investigations were performed in all these patients. RESULTS: Ten patients were included. Two patients had osteoporosis. Five others had osteopenia. Four patients had bone marrow involvement due to mastocytosis. One of these four patients had myelodysplasia. DISCUSSION: This study suggests better investigation of bone density and bone marrow in patients who have cutaneous mastocytosis. Systematic histopathology of bone marrow and osteodensitometry help to detect patients with systemic involvement. Bone densitometry is particularly effective for early detection of patients at risk for fracture and is of practical interest since patients with osteoporosis can now be treated with Pamidronate.
