Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) provides a new curative treatment option for patients usually not eligible for allogeneic SCT. Because the majority of patients lack HLA-identical sibling donors (SD), unrelated donor (UD) transplantation is performed increasingly. In this retrospective analysis, we have reviewed our experience with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, comparing related and unrelated donors. From November, 1997, to February, 2002, 51 patients with hematological malignancies received allogeneic SCT after various RIC regimens. A total of 31 had a related donor, and the remaining 20 had an unrelated donor (UD). Both groups were comparable with respect to age and gender. We observed a trend toward higher rate of graft failure in the unrelated donor group with 11% compared to 3% in the related donor group (p = 0.55). The rate of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) II-IV was 36% in the RD group versus 44% for the UD group; severe GVHD III-IV occurred in 26% and 22%, respectively. There were more serious infections in the unrelated donor group with 25% compared to 16%. Transplant-related mortality was 13% (RD group) versus 30% (UD group). At 21 months, progression-free survival was 30% in both groups. The Kaplan Meier estimate of overall survival was 40% (RD) and 30% (UD group). In summary, we found no statistically significant difference regarding progression free and overall survival, despite a trend for more graft failure and increased transplant-related complications associated with the use of stem cells from unrelated donors.
