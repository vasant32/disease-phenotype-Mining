A large multiple lobulated painless mass in the inguinal fossa, was investigated and removed, in a 58 years old patient with undiagnosed chronic myelodysplasia. The patient was initially referred to the urologic clinics for recurrent bleeding from the urinary tract, when the above mentioned and few smaller masses were palpated on the anterior aspect of the thigh. Clinical, laboratory and imaging investigation revealed enlargement of the spleen and the liver accompanied by relatively large and well separated tumors under the inguinal ligament extending to the upper thigh. From clinical history the patient had recurrent episodes of spontaneous bleeding from the nose and the bladder. He underwent open biopsy under general anesthesia where the inguinal tumor was found to be well encapsulated, firmly attached to a branch of the femoral nerve and loosely connected with the next mass that had similar characteristics. Intraoperative decision was made to excise the entire lesion which consisted of thirteen lobules of varying size, connected to each other as a chain. Histological examination revealed multifocal ancient neurilemona from a sensory branch of the femoral nerve. Further investigation of the patient for the episodes of hemorrhage and the enlargement of the spleen and the liver gave the diagnosis of chronic myelodysplasia. The patient was doing well one year after the excision of the tumor, and had an area with hypoesthesia above the knee. The concurrence of the two distinct neoplasms is discussed.
