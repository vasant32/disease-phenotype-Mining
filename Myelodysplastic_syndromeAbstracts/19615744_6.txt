We investigated whether, in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aberrant expression of miR-150/miR-221/miR-222 and their designated target mRNA molecules MYB, p27 and c-KIT may be involved in insufficient haematopoiesis. In a series of MDS (n=52), an aberrant increase of miR-150 was found only in MDS with associated del(5q) (n=9; p<0.01). The mRNA expression of transcription factor MYB, the designated target of miR-150, was shown to correlate inversely with the miR-150 level. Acute leukaemia evolving from MDS (n=11) showed significantly decreased levels of miR-221 but not miR-222. We conclude that inhibition of proliferation via over-expressed miR-150 might contribute to myelodysplastic haematopoiesis in MDS-del(5q).
