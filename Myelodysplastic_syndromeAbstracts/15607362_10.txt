Valpha24TCR+ CD161+ NKT (Valpha24+ NKT) cells are activated by alpha-galactosylceramide and can exert anti-tumor activity against a variety of tumor cells. In this study, we assessed the Valpha24+ NKT cell numbers in peripheral blood (PB) from 30 healthy donors and 70 patients with haematopoietic malignancy including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), malignant lymphoma (ML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Here, we demonstrated that PB Valpha24+ NKT cell numbers were significantly decreased in all the patients with haematopoietic malignancy in comparison with that in healthy donors (P < 0.005). In particular CD4- CD8- Valpha24+ NKT cell numbers were more significantly decreased in the patients with haematopoietic malignancy (P < 0.0001).
