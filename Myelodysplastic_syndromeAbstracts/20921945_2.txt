In this retrospective study, 63 patients >60 years with hematological malignancies and treated with allo-SCT and with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) were reviewed. A total of 51% of patients suffered from AML or myelodysplastic syndromes. Disease status before transplantation was CR or PR 71 with 29% transplanted with active disease. Patients were classified according to three published prognostic indexes: (1) hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI); (2) European BMT (EBMT) score; and (3) Pretransplantation Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score. The 100-day and 1-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) were 6 and 22%, respectively, for the entire group. The 2-year OS and PFS were 60 and 58%, respectively. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and extensive chronic GVHD was 46 and 48%, respectively. In a univariate analysis, neither the HCT-CI nor the EBMT score, nor the PAM score were predictive of TRM and OS. Only the occurrence of aGVHD affected the TRM and OS. ALLO-RIC is feasible in elderly patients. Even if those prognostic scores were not adapted to elderly patients, they did not predict for TRM and OS. aGVHD is the main cause of TRM and more efforts should be made to reduce its incidence without sacrificing graft vs tumor effect.
