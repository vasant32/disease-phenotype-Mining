Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of disorders characterised by progressive cytopenias and impaired maturation of haematopoietic cells. It carries a high mortality due to severe infections and/or bleeding, and transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Its treatment is largely unsatisfactory except a few favorable reports with low-dose cytarabine therapy, which has recently created a widespread enthusiasm for its use.
