This phase II trial investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of a topotecan/thalidomide combination therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB with transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic anemia. Patients received three 21-day cycles of topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) on days 1-5, which was repeated for two additional cycles in patients whose bone marrow blast percentages did not decrease. Oral thalidomide was then started at 100 mg/day (with the dose escalated up to 300 mg/day if well tolerated) for up to 1 year. Patients were monitored throughout the trial for hematologic and clinical adverse events, and efficacy was assessed using International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Forty-five patients, mostly elderly (median age 68 years; range 52-79 years), were enrolled. Therapy was generally well tolerated compared to high-dose chemotherapy. Three patients died from disease progression/infections during topotecan therapy, and four patients discontinued topotecan because of high-grade neutropenia (two patients), syncope (one patient), or hip surgery (one patient). Of 24 patients who received thalidomide, three discontinued because of treatment-related toxicity. Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for response: nine (24%) had hematologic improvement and 13 (34%) had stable disease. Responses occurred in patients with all disease subtypes. Six patients achieved transfusion independence, and one patient had a trilineage response. Approximately one-third of the patients had decreases in bone marrow blasts of 50%. Therefore, a topotecan and thalidomide combination therapy is promising, although further studies are needed to determine the optimum doses and schedule.
