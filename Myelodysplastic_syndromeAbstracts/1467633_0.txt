A 60-year-old patient is presented with primary myelodysplastic syndrome classified according to the criteria of the French-American-British classification as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and with a hyperviscosity syndrome. We found a monoclonal gammopathy with a very high serum immunoglobulin M level. There is strong evidence for coincidence of myelodysplastic syndrome and Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia in this patient.
