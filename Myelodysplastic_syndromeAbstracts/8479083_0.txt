Bone marrow specimens obtained from 54 patients with de novo AML and 7 patients with AML evolving from MDS were retrospectively examined for the presence of micromegakaryocytes defined as cells of less than 30 microns in diameter with one or two nuclei. At least 25 megakaryocytes were counted in each patient. Micromegakaryocytes were found in 17 cases (31%), M1:1/11, M2:5/18, M3:0/4, M4:5/12, M5:1/4, M6:4/4, M7:1/1. The median age of the patients was higher in de novo AML with micromegakaryocytes (57 years) than in de novo AML without micromegakaryocytes (41 years) (p = 0.014). Chromosomal analysis revealed that deletion of 5 or 5q-, 7 or 7q- was recognized only in the group of de novo AML with micromegakaryocytes and that t(15;17), t(8:21) and inv (16) were not recognized in this group. Micromegakaryocytes were identified in each bone marrow specimen obtained from 9 of 10 patients with de novo AML with trilineage myelodysplasia. The complete remission rate was significantly lower in de novo AML with micromegakaryocytes (33%) than in de novo AML without micromegakaryocytes (86%) (p = 0.001). The duration of survival of the patients with de novo AML with micromegakaryocytes was shown to be shorter than that of the patients with de novo AML without micromegakaryocytes (p = 0.017). Micromegakaryocytes were recognized in all of 7 patients with AML evolving from MDS. The presence of micromegakaryocytes in bone marrow of the patients with AML indicates a subset of AML with poor prognosis that may be closely associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.
