A case of neutrophilic dermatosis (ND) complicated by cryofibrinogenemia (CFGN) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is reported. Although the patient presented pancytopenia, the skin lesions were compatible with those of ND from the clinical and histopathological findings. Further, immunofluorescence technique revealed cryofibrinogen (CFG) deposits on the walls of the blood vessels in the skin lesion, and a high titer of CFG components was disclosed in the patient's peripheral blood. In this case, CFGN may have been associated with MDS; hence CFG deposits probably played a role, at least in part, in the skin lesion formation. This is probably the first case of ND complicated by CFGN. And careful examination of an underlying disease is recommended in association with ND and/or CFGN.
