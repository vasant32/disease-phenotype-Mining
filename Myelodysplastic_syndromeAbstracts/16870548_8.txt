We determined mutations and promoter methylation status of NPM1 using pyrosequencing in 199 samples of myeloid neoplasia including myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The mutations were present in 4% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, but not in other MPD or myelodysplastic syndromes. Promoter methylation was rare, and was found in only three samples of MPD.
