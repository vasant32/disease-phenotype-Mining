OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of calcitonin gene hypermethylation in the transformation from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemias (AML). METHODS: The methylation rate of calcitonin gene (CTMR) in the genomic DNA extracted from bone marrow cell of 27 MDS patients and 6 AML patients with antecedent MDS were studied by PCR amplification of Hpa I digested DNA, with external reference of undigested and Msp I digested DNA and internal reference of 112bp fragment containing N-ras-61. Intensity of silver-stained PCR products was measured by densitometer and analysed using the computer program. RESULTS: The CTMR was significantly higher in MDS (33.65% +/- 23.37%) than in control group (P<0.001), in 9 RAEB(T) (58.35% +/- 17.44%) than in the control and RA groups. Five RA patients who have survived three to ten years without leukemia, have a normal CTMR. Seven of 8 RAEB(T) patients who had a high CTMR of more than 30% evolved into AML in two months. CONCLUSION: CTMR might be a useful marker for predicting the evolution of MDS into AML.
