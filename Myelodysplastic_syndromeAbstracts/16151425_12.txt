Our objective was to study the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS). Among 71 SDS patients included in the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry, 10 received HSCT between 1987 and 2004 in five institutions. The indications were bone marrow failure in five cases, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia in five cases. The median follow-up of patients who survived without relapse is 6.9 years (3.1-16.8 years). The conditioning regimen consisted of a busulfan-cyclophosphamide combination (n=6) or total body irradiation plus chemotherapy (n=4). Six patients received stem cells from unrelated donors and four from identical siblings. Engraftment was complete in eight patients and unassessable in two patients. These latter two patients died of infections 32 and 36 days after HSCT, with grade IV graft-versus-host disease and multiorgan dysfunction. A third patient died from an acute respiratory distress syndrome 17 months after HSCT with progressive granulocytic sarcoma. One patient had an MDS relapse 4 months after HSCT and died 10 months later. The overall 5-year event-free survival rate is 60+/-15%. We conclude that HSCT is feasible for patients with SDS who develop bone marrow failure or malignant transformation.
