Eleven cases of chronic subdural hematoma (CSH) secondary to coagulopathy were experienced in our department in the last 5 years. They were classified into 4 groups, I: secondary to diffuse metastatic carcinomatosis of the bone marrow (4 cases), II: malignant hematological disease (acute lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome 1 case each), III: postreplacement of cardiac valves or vein graft having been treated with anticoagulants (warfarin) (3 cases) and IV: chronic renal failure after having been hemodialyzed (2 cases). The outcomes were all good in group III, and there was one good outcome in group IV. However, death was the outcome in all the other cases. Conservative treatment (mannitol and steroid for 2 weeks) was carried out in 4 cases, all of which improved clinically with diminished hematoma. In 9 cases, surgical treatment was attempted by means of burr hole irrigation of the hematoma. Two of them developed intracerebral hematoma, and one developed acute brain swelling. In conclusion, treatment of CSH secondary to coagulopathy should be selected as follows. 1. Conservative treatment is to be the first choice, if conditions allow it. 2. Surgery can be performed by burr hole irrigation when indicated. Precautions should be taken not to injure the inner membrane of the hematoma or the brain proper, and the need for slow decompression should be kept in mind.
