Fifty consecutive adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with an intensive cyclical chemotherapy and the mean received dose of individual cytotoxic drug was retrospectively studied. The median age was 28 years. Twenty-one (43%) had white blood cell (WBC) count over 30 x 10(9)/l. Of the 26 patients with successful cytogenetic studies, ten (28%) had unfavorable clonal chromosomal abnormalities (four Philadelphia chromosome, six others). A high complete remission (CR) rate (86%) was achieved. This was associated with delivery of 100% of the planned dosage of vincristine, prednisone, and daunorubicin at induction. Dose reduction of asparaginase, the fourth drug in the induction protocol, was recorded in 20 (40%) patients. The CR rate of these patients was not adversely affected. Dose reduction was recorded during consolidation (38 of 43 remitters) and maintenance (18 of 20 remitters) as a result of treatment toxicity. The mean received dose of teniposide, Ara-C, asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate was 73% (SD 7%), 73% (SD 7%), 62% (SD 41%), 65% (SD 15%) and 73% (SD 17%) of the planned dosage, respectively. The 5-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 11% (95% CI: 0-27%) and 13% (95% CI: 0-26%), respectively. Even standard-risk patients had 4-year LFS of only 26% (95% CI: 0-57%). Among 36 remitters not withdrawn from consolidation, there were 29 treatment failures after a median follow-up of 42 months; 25 (86%) of these were leukemia relapse, three (10%) were toxic death during consolidation, and one patient (4%) died from therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. We postulate inadequate drug delivery during postremission therapy contributed to the high relapse rate in the whole group as well as the standard-risk patients.
