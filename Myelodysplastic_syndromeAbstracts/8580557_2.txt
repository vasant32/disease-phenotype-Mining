A 40-year-old female patient with Werner's syndrome (WS) suffering from thyroid cancer and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is reported. She had been diagnosed as having WS complicated with thyroid cancer seven years previously. Total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (131I, 100 mCi/year) therapy for seven years had slowed the progression of thyroid cancer. She suffered a sudden onset of MDS at the age of 40 years. After six months she died from overt leukemia. We found an additional chromosome aberration of chromosome 10 in the progression of leukemia from MDS.
