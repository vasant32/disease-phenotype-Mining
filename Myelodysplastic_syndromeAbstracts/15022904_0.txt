HIV infection is associated with a wide range of hematological abnormalities. The peripheral blood findings and the morphological abnormalities in the bone marrow can simulate myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, and T cell lymphoma. We studied the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow findings of 42 patients with HIV infection over a 3-year period with the aim of recognising the morphological findings sufficiently characteristic of HV infection. The salient peripheral blood smear findilngs were anemia, bicytopenia and pancytopenia. The bone marrow revealed trilineage dysplasia, plasma cells and eosinophils, increased megakaryocytes, increased iron and reticulin fibrosis. In two cases the bone marrow revealed granulomata.
