 UNLABELLED: Three-dimensional visualization of renal arteries has recently been established by helical contrast-enhanced multiple detector-row computed tomographical angiography (MDCTA) in adults. So far, no information is available on its use in children. We reported two children with renal artery stenosis detected by 64-channel MDCTA. The first patient probably had fibromuscular dysplasia and the other neurofibromatosis type 1. The technique showed a left renal artery stenosis with a small left kidney in the first patient and a right renal artery stenosis in the second. CONCLUSION: MDCTA is an accurate and noninvasive imaging technique, easily performed in children, and can be used as an alternative diagnostic modality in children with suspected renovascular hypertension.
