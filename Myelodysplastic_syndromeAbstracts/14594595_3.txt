A 66-year-old woman with a myelodysplastic syndrome developed a widespread, pruritic, nodular eruption. A skin-biopsy specimen showed a granulomatous infiltrate, with no evidence of clonality; a bone-marrow biopsy showed possible transition to acute myeloid leukemia. This presentation is consistent with two prior reports of granulomatous eruptions occurring in the setting of myelodysplasia.
