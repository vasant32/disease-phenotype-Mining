The coexistence of a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a T-cell cutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is an extremely rare event, which has so far only been reported in a single instance in the literature. We describe herein an additional case in which the lymphoid disease was combined with an MDS at the time of its evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Both diseases were successfully treated with a regimen containing fludarabine. We discuss possible pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest the use of nonalkylating drugs, such as fludarabine, for the treatment of this rare association of malignancies usually characterized by a very poor response to therapy.
