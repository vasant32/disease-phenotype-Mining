The cases of chromosome 11 abnormalities in leukemic bone marrow cells have constituted 14.0% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 18.7% in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 16.7% in refractory anemia (RA). The bands of the short arms 11p13, 11p14, llp15 and the long arms 11q14, 11q21, 11q23 were involved in chromosome rearrangements. The rearrangements of the band 11q23 were detected more often. Reciprocal translocations were found with the highest frequency, while para- and pericentic invertions, terminal and intestitial deletions occured with the lower incidence. Deletions were found in RA cases only. Comparison with the clinical features showed no correlation with the age and the main haematological indexes including the amount of blast cells in the initial period. The results have showed the poor prognosis of the abnormalities not only of 11q21, 11q23 in acute leukemia (AL), but of 11p13, 11p15 in AML as well, while not enough data on this subject is availalbe in the literature.
