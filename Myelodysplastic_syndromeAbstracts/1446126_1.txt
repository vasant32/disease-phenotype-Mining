Splenomegaly associated with myelodysplastic disorders in children may be massive and can result in pancytopenia, abdominal discomfort, and respiratory distress. When these symptoms cannot be relieved by nonsurgical means, splenectomy may be indicated. Under such conditions, surgical splenectomy carries increased risks, as the thrombocytopenia is difficult to correct secondary to splenic sequestration. Additionally, the surgical anatomy is often distorted secondary to the massive spleen and dissection can be difficult. These factors can lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. In an attempt to decrease intraoperative blood loss, the authors successfully performed preoperative splenic artery embolization in 11 of 12 children (age range, 1-11 years) with pancytopenia due to hypersplenism. Hypersplenism requiring surgical splenectomy was due to leukemia (n = 9), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), immune thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and osteopetrosis (n = 1). Embolization was performed under general anesthesia, prior to surgery, with gelatin sponge particles alone, Gianturco coils alone, or a combination of polyvinyl alcohol sponge particles and Gianturco coils. Embolization allowed for safe surgical splenectomy.
