Ineffective erythropoiesis is an early feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), usually accompanying an hypercellular marrow. In a previous study, concentrations of serum erythropoietin (EPO) in MDS have been shown to correlate inversely both with haemoglobin concentration and with % bone marrow erythroblasts. We have measured erythroid production using a radioisotopic technique in 20 patients with MDS. Although haemoglobin concentration shows a weak inverse relationship with serum EPO concentration there is considerable variation in EPO concentration at a given haemoglobin level. There is no correlation between serum EPO and total erythroid production, though there is a weak correlation with effective erythropoiesis. The data suggests that control mechanisms of erythropoiesis in patients with MDS are complex.
