Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a family of clonal disorders characterized by dyshematopoiesis and susceptibility to acute myelogenous leukemia. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are cytokines that play key roles in the pathogenesis of MDS. There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta protein, and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha. The association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to MDS and the progression of the disease was investigated. As compared with healthy control subjects (n = 74), patients with MDS (n = 55) showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha. Similarly, there were no differences in the distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes between the MDS patients with only anemia (mild group) and those with bi- or pancytopenia (severe group). On the other hand the TT homozygosity at codon 10 in exon 1 of TGF-beta1 gene was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia [95% CI OR = 4.889, p = 0.0071]. These findings suggest that the investigated genetic polymorphisms do not predispose to the development of MDS, but that TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism may affect the disease progression.
