The human polyomavirus BK (BKV)-associated hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) has been a frequent and, seldom life-threatening complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The authors report a male with melodysplastic syndrome, who developed BKV-associated late-onset HC 12 days after HLA-matched unrelated BMT. His urine contained epithelial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies suggestive of BKV infection and was positive for BKV in polymerase chain reaction. He did not respond to any treatment for HC. In addition, he developed BKV-associated acute renal failure on day 26, followed by hepatic veno-occlusive disease on day 42. This is the first case in which BKV may be associated with fatal progressive renal failure.
