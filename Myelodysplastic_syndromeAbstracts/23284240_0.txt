 INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndrome is an incurable and rare hematological disease that affects the production of blood cells. One aim of treatment is to maintain the blood-cell count to near-normal levels. This is mainly achieved with hematopoietic- growth factors and transfusions. Our objective was to determine the cost of supportive treatment/care for patients with low and intermediate I risk myelodysplastic syndrome in respect to private healthcare plans in Brazil. METHOD: We adapted the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines for intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients to the Brazilian reality, adopting a decision tree to explore treatment combinations. Then, we calculated the costs for each branch of the tree, according to national prices. We also estimated total costs for a cohort of 100 patients, distributed across treatment combinations according to the expected epidemiology. We assumed a horizon of one year of treatment. RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment for low and intermediate I risk myelodysplastic syndrome is US$ 42,758/patient/year. This cost can vary from US$ 24,282 to US$ 121,952, according to patient characteristics and the treatment used. Overall, patients that require immunotherapy with antithymocyte globulins are associated with the highest cost. Those that achieve disease stability solely with the use of erythropoietin were associated with the lowest cost. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, treatment of low and intermediate I risk myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with a mean cost of the order of US$ 42,700/patient/year. New types of therapy have the potential to change this scenario if they can diminish the requirements for supportive care.
