 OBJECTIVES: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a useful tool to identify chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells. Numerous studies have compared chromosomal banding analysis (CBA) and FISH on fixed cultured bone marrow cells. However, up to now, there has been no study comparing two main sources of diagnostic material, i.e. bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies. We therefore analyzed these materials by FISH in comparison with CBA. METHODS: CBA revealed chromosomal aberrations in 18 patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 13), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 3), or chronic myeloproliferative syndrome (n = 2). FISH was performed on fixed cultured bone marrow cells, aspirates and trephine biopsies from each patient. RESULTS: Percentages of aberrant cells in the different materials correlated highly with Pearson values of 0.909 for biopsy/fixed cultured cells (p < 0.001), 0.830 for biopsy/aspirate (p < 0.001) and 0.768 for aspirate/fixed cultured cells (p < 0.001). Moreover, in bone marrow biopsies peritrabecular and central intertrabecular areas yielded very similar FISH results with a high correlation (r = 0.968, p < 0.001). FISH revealed a lower proportion of aberrant cells than CBA in 90% of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the different materials available for the FISH examination are comparable in sensitivity and show similar quantitative results. Therefore, the use of biopsy sections for the routine FISH examination of chromosomal abnormalities is a valid method.
