OBJECTIVE: Antithymocyte and antilymphocyte globulin (ATG/ALG) have a therapeutic effect in about 30% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We were interested to know whether responding patients achieve clonal or polyclonal remissions. PATIENTS: Ten women with low-risk MDS received either ALG or ATG. Before treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months later, X-chromosome inactivation patterns of peripheral blood T lymphocytes were compared with those of peripheral blood granulocytes or bone marrow cells, using the human androgen receptor gene assay and the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 assay. RESULTS: Six women did not respond to therapy. Prior to treatment, four of them had a monoclonal, one had an oligoclonal, and one had a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XCIP). Four patients responded to ATG/ALG. Three of them were informative in our X-inactivation assays, and showed a non-clonal XCIP which did not change significantly after treatment with ATG/ALG. CONCLUSION: A non-clonal XCIP in the bone marrow was associated with a response to ATG/ALG. Non-clonal XCIPs do not necessarily imply that there is no pathological clone. By definition, they just indicate that there is no evidence of a clone contributing more than 50% of cells in a sample. Non-clonal XCIPs may therefore be attributable to incomplete clonal expansion. This, in turn, might be explained by a vigorous immune attack against the MDS clone, which simultaneously causes collateral damage in the remaining normal haemopoiesis. In such patients, ATG/ALG may improve normal haemopoiesis by relieving the immunological pressure on the innocent bystanders.
