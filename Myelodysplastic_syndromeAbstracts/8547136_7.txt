The membrane expression of CD45RA and CD45RO on fresh leukaemic cells taken from 529 cases of acute haemopoietic malignancies, including 117 B-origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-origin ALL), 37 T-origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-origin ALL0, 297 de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 42 refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and 36 myeloid blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML-BP-my), was analysed. B-origin ALLs were characterized by the lack of the RO isoform along with the consistent presence of RA. Conversely, a differential expression of the two isoforms was detected in different subsets of T-origin ALL, in that T-stem cell leukaemias (T-SCL: CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD1-) preferentially expressed CD45RA whereas conventional T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (T-ALL: CD7+, CD4+ and/or CD8+ and/or CD1+) were consistently marked by CD45RO. Within myeloid malignancies, most of AMLs displayed CD45RA, while a substantial group of CML-BP-my preferentially exhibited CD45RO. As a general rule, a reciprocal exclusion of the two isoforms was observed in AML as well as in ALL. Nevertheless, a frequent coexpression of CD45RA and CD45RO was observed in CD14+ AML. In vitro treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was able to promote a switch from CD45RA to CD45RO expression in 27 de novo AML, independently from morphological subtyping. To our knowledge, this is the first report on CD45 isoform expression in a large series of patients with acute leukaemia. The knowledge of the differential expression of CD45RA and CD45RO can ameliorate our classificative approach to haematological malignancies, as well as disclose new multiple overlap points between normal and leukaemic cell differentiation.
