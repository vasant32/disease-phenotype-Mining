Although iron overload is clinically significant, only limited data have been published on iron overload in haematological diseases. We investigated cardiac and liver iron accumulation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a cohort of 87 subjects who did not receive chelation, including 59 haematological patients. M-HIC (MRI-based hepatic iron concentration, normal values <36 μmol/g) is a non-invasive, liver biopsy-calibrated method to analyse iron concentration. This method, calibrated to R2 (transverse relaxation rate), was used as a reference standard (M-HIC(R2)). Transfusions and ferritin were evaluated. Mean M-HIC(R2) and cardiac R(*) of all patients were 142 μmol/g (95% CI, 114-170) and 36.4 1/s (95% CI, 34.2-38.5), respectively. M-HIC(R2) was higher in haematological patients than in patients with chronic liver disease or normal controls (P<0.001). Clearly elevated cardiac R2(*) was found in two myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with severe liver iron overload. A poor correlation was found between liver and cardiac iron (n=82, r=0.322, P=0.003), in contrast to a stronger correlation in MDS (n=7, r=0.905, P=0.005). In addition to transfusions, MDS seemed to be an independent factor in iron accumulation. In conclusion, the risk for cardiac iron overload in haematological diseases other than MDS is very low, despite the frequently found liver iron overload.
