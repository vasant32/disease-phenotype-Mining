Mastocytosis may be associated with clonal nonmast cell lineage hematologic diseases, including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, and acute myeloid leukemia. Here we present a patient with the simultaneous diagnosis of mastocytosis and an acute myeloid leukemia, M2 subtype in the French-American-British classification, with t(8;21) carrying a population of immature mast cell precursors, and discuss this presentation in the context of a potential pathogenetic cellular link between this leukemia and mastocytosis.
