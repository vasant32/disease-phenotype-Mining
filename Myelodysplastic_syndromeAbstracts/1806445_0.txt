BACKGROUND: The proved effectiveness and relatively low extrahematological toxicity of Mitoxantrone, Ara-C and Etoposide as single agents and in combination in the treatment of acute non lymphoid leukemia (ANLL) are well established. In a phase II study the efficacy and toxicity of an induction combination regimen with Mitoxantrone, Ara-C and Etoposide were evaluated for treatment of poor risk ANLL patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven poor prognosis ANLL patients were treated with Mitoxantrone, 7 mg/sm days 1-3; VP16, 150 mg/sm days 1-3; Ara-C, 200 mg/sm continuous infusion days 1-5. Median age of treated patients was 63 (17-78): 10 de novo leukemias (4 greater than 65 yrs 3 with cardiomyopathy); 12 secondary leukemias (5 secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome, 5 to myeloproliferative syndrome, 2 to other neoplasias); 3 relapses; 2 refractory. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (55.5%) achieved CR (8 de novo leukemias, 3 relapses, 4 secondary leukemias); 7 died in induction, 5 progressed. Median remission duration was 27 weeks (range 5-70 wks) and overall median survival 13 weeks (range 4-80). Extraematological toxicity was low, but five patients died from infections and two from hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: The combination tested in this trial proved effective in the treatment of "poor risk" ANLL, but the results need to be confirmed on greater numbers of patients, mainly in the group of de novo leukemias that can't be treated with more aggressive regimens.
