We report a patient with poor-prognosis myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after successful treatment of lymphoma, who was given an allogeneic BMT, engrafted and achieved complete remission, but later had a relapse of his MDS with complete disappearance of donor haemopoiesis. After two episodes of CMV pneumonia and continued prophylactic use of ganciclovir thereafter, he experienced a spontaneous complete disappearance of all signs of MDS, including myelofibrosis, and a complete return to donor haemopoiesis. This case is the first one to suggest a graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GVL) in MDS patients. It depicts the complex relationship between GVL, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. It could also constitute a clinical illustration of the possible antileukaemic effect of CMV infection and its treatment with ganciclovir.
