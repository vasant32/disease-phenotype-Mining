62 evaluable patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute leukemia were treated with different combinations of low dose ara-C, alpha-interferon (IFN), 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (vit D3) and retinoic acid. The aim was to study the efficacy and toxicity of each combination. The overall rate was 44%. Of these, 50% responded favorably to the combination of IFN, vit D3 and retinoic acid (IDR), which was comparable to the response rate of 43% for low-dose ara-C. The results of the IDR treatment may be explained by additive or synergistic effects between the separate drugs in the combination. Ara-C and IDR treatment was generally well-tolerated but interferon gave more side effects than any other drug used in the study. Evaluation of the full combination of ara-C, IFN, vit D3 and retinoic acid was not possible because of toxicity. Marrow hypoplasia was infrequent (5/27 patients) in cases responding favorably to treatment. Complete remissions were not longer than partial remissions or significant responses.
