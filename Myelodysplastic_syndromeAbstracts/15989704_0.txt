 PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), we conducted HDCT with ASCT using a drug-only protocol without total body irradiation. Previously untreated and treated adult patients with aggressive lymphoma were enrolled onto this study. For the HDCT protocol, we developed the AECC regimen, a drug-only regimen consisting of etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and nimustine (ie, ACNU). Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were used mainly as a source for ASCT and were used based on collection rates of CD34 cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled and assessed for this study. The median length of follow-up was 6.5 years, with a range of 0.2-12.5 years. Retrospective immunophenotypic examination indicated that the majority of the patients were diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: Before HDCT, 37 patients still had disease (26 partial responses [PRs] and 11 cases of no response), and 19 patients exhibited a complete response (CR) before HDCT with ASCT. Among 56 patients, 37 (66%) exhibited a CR, including patients continuing their first CR and those experiencing a second or further CR, and 11 patients (19.6%) exhibited PR on HDCT with ASCT. Outcomes of patients without CR were significantly poorer than those of the patients with CR, and 7-year overall survival rates of patients with and without CR were 63% and 27.2%, respectively. No patients developed a second malignancy, including leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT is one of the available consolidation therapies for aggressive NHL, and additional involved-field irradiation could play a role in the management of patients with NHL who do not exhibit a CR after treatment with HDCT containing a drug-only program.
