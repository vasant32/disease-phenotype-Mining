We report 67 patients with acute erythroid leukemia (erythroleukemia) based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification. Reviewing the clinicopathologic features, cytogenetics and outcomes, the characteristics of erythroleukemia resembled myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Patients with poor performance status, advanced anemia and poor-risk cytogenetics had significantly inferior outcomes. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for MDS is useful to differentiate the prognosis of erythroleukemia.
