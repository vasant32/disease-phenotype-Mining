 AIMS: Intravenous formulations of busulfan have recently become available. Although busulfan is used frequently in children as part of a myeloablative regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation, pharmacokinetic data on intravenous busulfan in children are scarce. The aim was to investigate intravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics in children and to suggest a limited sampling strategy in order to determine busulfan systemic exposure with the minimum of inconvenience and risk for the patient. METHODS: Plasma pharmacokinetics after the first administration was investigated in six children using nonlinear mixed effect modelling. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics showed little variability and were described adequately with a one-compartment model (population estimates CL,av=0.29 l h(-1) kg(-1); V,av=0.84 l kg(-1); t(1/2)=1.7-2.8 h). Combined with limited sampling and a Bayesian fitting procedure, the model can adequately estimate the systemic exposure to intravenous busulfan, which in children appears to be at the lower end of the adult range. CONCLUSIONS: Busulfan systemic exposure in children during intravenous administration can be estimated adequately with limited sampling and a Bayesian fitting procedure from a one-compartment model. Intravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics in children should be the subject of more research.
