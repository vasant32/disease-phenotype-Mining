The objective was to study the incidence and prognosis significance of -7/7q- abnormalities in acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of R-band was used to test -7/7q- chromosome abnormalities in 410 patients with acute leukemia (AL), in 71 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in 36 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase (CML-AP). The results showed that the incidences of -7/7q- abnormalities in AL, MDS and CML-AP patients were 4.88%, 9.86% and 8.33% respectively. The -7/7q- abnormalities could be found in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), incidences of which were 4.70% and 6.25% (P > 0.05) respectively. 9 cases had -7 or 7q- as the sole chromosome abnormalities, 22 cases showed other additional chromosome abnormalities: -X, -5, +8, t(3; 3), t(11;16) and t(2;11). Monosomy -7 and 7q- abnormality clone was found in one patient with MDS-RAEB, and the number of cells with -7 abnormality was greater than that of 7q- abnormality cells. Four patients acquired CR among 7 patients with ALL after chemotherapy, but 2 out of 13 patients with AML achieved CR while 6 out of 7 patients with MDS transformed into AL. No patients with CML-AP achieved CR. In conclusion, -7/7q- is a frequent aberration in hematologic malignancies as well as AML and ALL. The monosomy -7 and 7q-abnormalities were detected in the same patient. The patients with -7/7q- abnormalities show poor prognosis.
