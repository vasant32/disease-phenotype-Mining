This study was aimed to investigate the expression level of stromal cell derived factor-1 gene (SDF-1) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The MSC from bone marrow samples of MDS patients were isolated, cultured and expanded, the morphology and immunophenotype of MSC were analyzed. The expression levels of SDF-1 and internal reference GAPDH in MSC of MDS patients were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) method and were compared with expression levels of healthy donors. The results showed that the expression levels of SDF-1 in MDS patients were significantly different from those in healthy donors (1.53 +/- 0.92 vs 5.51 +/- 0.99) (P < 0.01). SDF-1 gene expression levels in bone marrow MSC of MDS patients were significantly higher than that in MSC derived from healthy donors. It is concluded that the abnormal expression of SDF-1 gene in MSC may influence the regulation of hematopoiesis of the bone marrow microenvironment in MDS patients and it is worthy of further investigation for new clue on etiological mechanism and treatment of MDS.
