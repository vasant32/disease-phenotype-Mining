Most patients with advanced or recurrent uterine sarcoma experience disease progression and ultimately die. We present a case of uterine sarcoma with lung metastasis treated with systemic chemotherapy and with no evidence of disease for more than 5 years. A 77-year-old woman underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for carcinosarcoma of the uterus followed by external pelvic radiotherapy. Ten months later, the tumor recurred in the apex of the vagina and was treated with brachytherapy. After 6 months of remission, she presented with pulmonary metastasis. After four cycles of systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide, the pulmonary nodules completely disappeared. Currently she is still in complete remission after more than 5 years, but unfortunately she has developed myelodysplastic syndrome. This is the first reported case in the literature of cured metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma to lungs, with long-term survival of 5 years.
