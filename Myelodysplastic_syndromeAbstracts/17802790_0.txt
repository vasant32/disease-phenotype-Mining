AIM: To test feasibility of transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells (THSC) with conditioning in low-intensity regimen associated with minimal toxic complications and engraftment in patients with hematological malignancy (HM) from a high risk group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THSC was performed in 33 patients aged 18 to 65 years. Most of the patients suffered from acute leukemia and advanced forms of myelodysplastic syndrome. All the patients had severe complications excluding standard transplantation. Pretransplantation preparation was based on fludarabine and moderate doses of busulfane. Engraftment was achieved in 94% patients. Of complications, there were primarily infections, relapses, graft versus host reactions (45, 24, 57.5%, respectively). Overall survival was 53%, relapse-free--67%, follow-up median 23.6 months. CONCLUSION: THSC after conditioning in the regime of low intensity is an effective method of HM treatment in patients with contraindications to standard transplantation. The main problem is a high risk to develop graft versus host reaction, especially a chronic form.
