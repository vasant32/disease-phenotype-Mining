We report two cases of aspergillosis with skin lesions. The first involved a 63-year-old female with acute lymphocytic leukemia. In 1992, she received chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Subsequently, she noted swelling of her leg, a skin biopsy was performed and Aspergillus flavus was isolated. The second patient was a 71-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome. In 1996, he developed a massive inguinal abscess from which Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated. The prognosis of aspergillosis was poorer in the case with skin swelling than in the one with a massive abscess.
