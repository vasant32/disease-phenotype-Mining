In 41 patients with myelodysplasia, the sensitivity in the lower urinary tract was investigated both with the evaluation of the perception of bladder filling and with the determination of the electrical sensory threshold of the urinary bladder wall. Visceral proprioceptive and/or exteroceptive bladder sensitivity proved, rather unexpectedly, to be present in a majority of the patients. The findings of these investigations did not correlate with any of the data of a clinical neurological examination. The evaluation of the sensory innervation of the lower urinary tract is of importance for diagnosis and therapy. Its investigation necessitates specific tests.
