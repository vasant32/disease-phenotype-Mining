Eight patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Median age was 34.5 years and ranged between 3 and 45. FAB diagnosis was refractory anaemia (RA) in three, RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) in four and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) in one case. Four patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation whilst the other four received busulphan and cyclophosphamide. Engraftment was documented in seven of eight patients. Two patients died from complications related to the procedure. One had early veno-occlusive disease of the liver whilst the other died 46 months after BMT from pulmonary fibrosis. One patient died from recurrent disease 11 months after BMT. Five patients are alive and in complete remission 9-35 months post-transplantation. Four of these patients have a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 90%. These results suggest that BMT can induce prolonged disease-free survival in patients under 50 years of age. If a compatible donor is available, marrow transplantation should be seriously considered in the treatment of MDS.
