The growth characteristics and the prognostic value of cytokine-stimulated myeloid colony formation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are largely unknown. In this study we have determined the number of myeloid colony-forming units (mCFUs) in semisolid medium from 112 MDS patients and correlated them with French-American-British (FAB) type, the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), karyotype, peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) blast cells, cytopenias, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and survival data. Concerning the FAB classification, lower median mCFUs were found in patients with refractory anemia (RA) and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) compared to refractory anemia with excess of blast cells (RAEB) and refractory anemia with excess of blasts cells in transformation (RAEB-T). In vitro growth in MDS clearly correlated with the cytogenetic risk groups defined by the IPSS (30.5/10(5) PBMCs with favorable karyotypes, 191 in the intermediate prognostic group, 677 with unfavorable cytogenetics, p=0.015 favorable vs unfavorable). BM blast cells >5% (60.5 vs 255 colonies, p=0.032) as well as LDH levels above the normal limit (64.5 vs 425 colonies, p=0.045) were also associated with higher colony formation. Patients were stratified according to the number of circulating mCFUs into a low growth, intermediate growth and high growth group. Median survival was 343 days in the high growth, 1119 days in the low growth, and 2341 days in the intermediate growth group ( p=0.0002). Multivariate analyses revealed colony growth ( p=0.0056), PB blast cells ( p=0.0069), cytogenetic risk group ( p=0.024), and platelet count ( p=0.018) to predict survival in our patients. After inclusion of the IPSS risk categories, mCFU levels remained a highly predictive parameter for survival ( p=0.0056) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) transformation ( p=0.0003).
