The frequency of non-clonal structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 51 patients with MDS and 37 age-matched hematologically normal subjects is assessed. The frequency of aneuploid cells (p less than 0.001) and of structural aberrations (p less than 0.005) was significantly higher in MDS patients than in normal subjects, but showed no relationship with FAB type or with the presence of clonal karyotype abnormalities in the bone marrow. Exchange configurations were only observed in MDS patients (27.5%). The data also suggest that there may be an association between high peripheral blood aberration levels and rapidly progressive disease. This may indicate increased mutagen sensitivity and have implications for treatment.
