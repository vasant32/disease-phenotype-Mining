A 57-year-old man underwent an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for mantle cell lymphoma in August 1999. Anemia and thrombocytopenia appeared in November 2001. He was diagnosed with further hematological examination as having acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia following secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. He received the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from his HLA DRB1 locus mismatched brother in May 2002. The nonmyeloablative preparative regimen consisted of fludarabine 30mg/m2 for 6 days and busulfan 4mg/kg for 2 days. Eosinophilia, decrease of lacrimal fluid and liver dysfunction appeared on Day 104. We diagnosed this as chronic GVHD and treated the patient with prednisolone 10 mg/day. Thereafter, his chronic GVHD gradually improved. He had fever and myalgia in the extremities and lumbar region with elevated serum CPK and aldolase in January 2003. Histological examination led to a diagnosis of polymyositis simultaneously with chronic GVHD. Prednisolone 50 mg/day as an initial dose was started for the polymyositis following which the prednisolone dose was gradually tapered off. The polymyositis improved promptly after the administration of prednisolone and remains in remission with a current maintenance program of prednisolone 5 mg/day.
