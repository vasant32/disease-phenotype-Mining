As a first step in characterizing a t(5;16)(q31;p11.2) in a patient with the diagnosis refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, a cell fusion was carried out between bone marrow cells from the patient and the Chinese hamster cell line A3. Using PCR and FISH analysis on hybrid lines containing the human derivative 16 chromosome, the breakpoints could be mapped between the markers TCF-7 and IL-9 on chromosome 5 and OL-7 and s30A4 on chromosome 16, both regions spanning approximately 1 Mb. Since the breakpoint on 5q has occurred in a region that is frequently deleted in myeloid malignancies, the gene disrupted by this translocation could also be implicated in this aberration.
