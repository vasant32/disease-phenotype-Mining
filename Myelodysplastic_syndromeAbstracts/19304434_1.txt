Hepatitis B reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative and anti-HBsAg antibodies-positive patients is an infrequent complication of chemotherapy, usually with fatal evolution. Here we report an HBsAg-negative patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, who developed hepatitis B reactivation after chemotherapy and evolved favorably after lamivudine treatment, allowing seroconversion.
