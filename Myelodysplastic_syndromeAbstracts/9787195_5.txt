In an attempt to identify potential new genes homologous to ETO,1,2 we screened the dbEST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./dbEST/index.html) using the entire ETO cDNA sequence as a probe (EMBL accession no. X79990). Among the ESTs identified, we selected two overlapping clones (clone IDs 43629 and 274508) and sequenced them to completion. A putative translation initiation site was identified by the presence of a strong Kozak consensus sequence,3 followed by a 1,725-bp open reading frame (ORF) coding for a putative protein of 575 amino acids (aa) (GenBank accession no. AF068266). We named this gene EHT (ETO Homologous on chromosome Twenty; see mapping data below). The putative EHT protein is closely homologous to ETO/MTG8 (65% identity) and Nervy, an ETO Drosophila homolog (24% identity) showing the four conserved domains found in MTG8 and Nervy.4 To find EST clones that could represent the EHT 5UTR, we screened the dbEST data bank with the 5 end of clone 274508, and identified an EST clone (GenBank accession no. AA635096) encompassing the EHT ATG codon, preceded by an in-frame stop codon 129 bp upstream (Fig 1, top). Therefore, we considered this sequence the putative 5UTR of EHT gene. While this work was in progress, the cloning of a similar ORF, named MTGR1 (myeloid translocation gene-related protein 1) was reported5; it presents an ATG codon, immediately preceded by a stop codon and with no clear Kozak sequence, upstream to and in-frame with the EHT ATG (see Fig 1, top), leading to the coding of additional 29 aa with respect to EHT ORF. Interestingly, Calabi and Cilli have recently deposited in the dbEST data bank a 5 UTR MTGR1 sequence (accession no. AF052212) that is identical to the putative EHT 5 UTR (GenBank clone AA635096). Overall, these data suggest the presence of two alternative 5 ends in the MTGR1/EHT gene, similar to ETO/MTG8 gene.1,2 The existence in nature of EHT ORF was confirmed by direct sequencing of a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplified fragment encompassing the coding sequence from HL60 mRNA (data not shown).
