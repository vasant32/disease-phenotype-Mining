The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism underlying the regulation of 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME)-induced cell apoptosis by mcl-1 and bax gene in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The MUTZ-1 cells were pretreated with 2-ME; then the activity of caspases-3 was determined by fluorescent colorimetry; the mRNA expressions of apoptosis-related genes (mcl-1) and bcl-2-related X protein (bax) were determined by RT-PCR. The results showed that as compared with control, the 2-ME enhanced the activity of caspase-3 in MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manners (p<0.05); along with increasing of 2-ME concentration, the expression of intracellular mcl-1 mRNA reduced (p<0.05), meanwhile the expression level of mcl-1 mRNA negatively correlated to the activity of caspase-3 at the corresponding time points (r=-0.992, p<0.01), but the expression of bax mRNA did not show significant change (p>0.05). It is concluded that 2-ME can regulate the apoptosis of MDS cells through the pathway of down-regulating the expression of mcl-1 mRNA and activating the caspase-3.
