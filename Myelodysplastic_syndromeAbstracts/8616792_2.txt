A 48-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue, nasal bleeding, and petechiae on his extremities. He was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia with trilineage myelodysplasia (T-MDS). Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed t(7;11)(p15;p15), which has been rarely reported but known to be characteristic of Japanese patients. Although t(7;11)(p15;p15) has been reported mainly in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), it can be occasionally found in so-called stem cell diseases such as chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Therefore, t(7;11)(p15;p15) might affect trilineage progenitors or stem cells as well as myeloid lineage cells, subsequently resulting in AML with T-MDS, as in our case reported here.
