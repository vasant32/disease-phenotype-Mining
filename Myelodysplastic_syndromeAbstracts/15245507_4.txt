Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders characterised by ineffective and dyspoietic haematopoiesis. The natural history of these disorders is variable and ranges from a chronic to a rapid course towards leukaemic progression. Certain shortcomings have been encountered in the French-American-British (FAB) classification over the years, and therefore there is a need for an alternative method of classification. In 1999, the WHO published a revised classification of MDS. In the present study, we have analysed the clinical, haematological and histomorphological features in 96 cases of primary MDS seen in the department of haematology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) over a 6-yr period (1996-2001). Both FAB and WHO classifications have been incorporated and the Bournemouth scoring system applied in each case at presentation. The Bournemouth scoring system, in the absence of a cytogenetic study, offers a good prognostication and long-term survival estimate.
