We describe a 70-year-old man with cutaneous granulocytic sarcoma who presented with numerous cutaneous nodules but without any leukaemic involvement of the peripheral blood. The tumour cells were positive for lysozyme, peroxidase, CD11a, CD11c, CD33 and HLA-DR, and weakly positive for CD4 and CD14, suggesting granulocytic differentiation. The bone marrow at admission showed dysplasia of the erythrocytic and granulocytic lineage and complex chromosomal abnormalities in association with an increase in monocytes. The patient was diagnosed as having granulocytic sarcoma of monocytic lineage with concomitant myelodysplastic syndrome. In this case, tumour cells also expressed the neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56), which has been suggested as a possible risk factor for developing granulocytic sarcoma in acute myelogenous leukaemia.
