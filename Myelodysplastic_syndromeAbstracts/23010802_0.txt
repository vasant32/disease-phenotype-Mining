Activating point mutations in CBL have recently been identified in diverse subtypes of myeloid neoplasms. Because detailed clinical and hematological characteristics of CBL-mutated cases is lacking, we screened 156 BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F negative patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and overlap syndromes between myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and MPN (MPS/MPN) for mutations in exons 8 and 9 of CBL by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. CBL mutations were identified in 16/156 patients (10%), of which five also carried mutations in EZH2 (n = 3) and TET2 (n = 2). Comprehensive clinical and hematological characteristics were available from 13/16 patients (81%). In addition to splenomegaly (77%), striking common hematological features were CML-like left-shifted leukocytosis (85%) with monocytosis (85%), anemia (100%), and thrombocytopenia (62%). Thrombocytosis was not observed in any patient. Relevant bone marrow features (n = 12) included hypercellularity (92%) with marked granulopoiesis (92%), nonclustered microlobulated megakaryocytes (83%), and marrow fibrosis (83%). Nine deaths (progression to secondary acute myeloid leukemia/blast phase, n = 7; cytopenia complications, n = 2) were recorded. Three-year survival rate was 27%, possibly indicating poor prognosis of CBL mutated MDS/MPN patients.
