We examined the intracellular alkaline phosphatase (NIAP) activities in peripheral neutrophils in 15 normal controls, 4 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and 4 with chronic myeloid leukemia. NIAP activities were decreased in myelodysplastic syndrome in comparing to normal controls (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that measurement of NIAP activity is useful for supporting a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.
