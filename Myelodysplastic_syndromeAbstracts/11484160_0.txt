OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) in the detection of monosomy 7 (-7)or deletion of long arm of chromosome 7(7q-) in the cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Forty-six cases of MDS and 10 normal controls were studied simultaneously by conventional karyotype analysis and interphase FISH technique using SpectrumRed directly labeled DNA specific probe for 7q32. Two hundred interphase cells were analyzed for each case and the cells with one red hybridization spot<7% were regarded as positive. RESULTS: Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH. Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH. CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in MDS and it is more sensitive than CC.
