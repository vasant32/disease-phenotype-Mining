A case of acquired haemophilia A presenting with extensive spontaneous bruising and anaemia is reported. The anaemia was due to myelodysplastic syndrome (FAB: refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts). A factor-VII:C-specific inhibitor was also found. Prednisone and pyridoxine were given, and the inhibitor became undetectable after 4 weeks of therapy, but the abnormal ringed sideroblasts still persisted on repeated bone marrow biopsy.
