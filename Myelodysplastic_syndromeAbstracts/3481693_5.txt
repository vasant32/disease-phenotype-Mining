Pyoderma gangrenosum has been recognized occurring in association with acute and chronic leukaemia. More recently it has been described in patients with myelodysplasia (Jacobs, Palmer & Gordon-Smith 1985). We report a case of pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with a preceding history of myelodysplasia, illustrating the problem of controlling the skin disease in this condition and the eventual transformation of the myelodysplasia into acute leukaemia. Treatment of the leukaemia resulted in improvement of the skin lesions.
