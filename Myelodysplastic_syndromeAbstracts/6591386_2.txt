A consecutive series of patients (1978-1981) comprising all patients with acute leukaemia from a population of 475000 inhabitants was reviewed. Thus, 94 patients were diagnosed as having acute leukaemia. No patients were lost from follow-up. The incidence figures of ALL and AML differed significantly from those of Sweden as a whole. 9 patients were less than 15 years old. The median age of adult patients was 64 years, 60.8% being greater than or equal to 60 years old. Of adult patients with AML, 20% had a preleukaemic history (chronic myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes and others). None of 6 patients with leukaemia as a metamorphosis of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder achieved a complete remission. The overall remission rate of the remaining adult patients was 25%. Treated patients, 15-39 years old, with AML without any preleukaemic history, had a complete remission rate of 80% compared to 12% for patients greater than or equal to 60 years old with the same diagnosis. Of 60 patients with 'primary' AML, 14 were not treated, mainly because of advanced age and complicating diseases. Most of these patients died within a week of admission.
