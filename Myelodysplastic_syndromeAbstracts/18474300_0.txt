Tetraploidy is a very rare cytogenetic abnormality in myelocytic malignancies, and its significance is unclear to date. We report here on a 68-year-old male diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS/RAEB). Cytogenetic analysis of his bone marrow biopsy at initial clinical presentation and in subsequent studies revealed the presence of two abnormal clones, 92,XXYY and 92,XXYY,del(5)(q13q33). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of abnormal cells confirmed interstitial deletion in 5q, demonstrated predominance of the tetraploid clone and persistent presence of the tetraploid clone with 5q deletion. The patient was not responsive to Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment, which is routinely used in patients with 5q- syndrome. However, a subsequent course of therapy with the methyl-transferase inhibitor decitabine resulted in clinical and cytogenetic remission. Our data suggest that the unique complex abnormality of tetraploidy and 5q deletion described here for the first time in MDS is characterized by distinct disease etiology, the mechanism of which could involve epigenetic inactivation of gene expression via methylation.
