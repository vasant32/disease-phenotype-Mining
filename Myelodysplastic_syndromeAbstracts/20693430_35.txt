Mutations in the TET2 gene are frequent in myeloid disease, although their biologic and prognostic significance remains unclear. We analyzed 355 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes using "next-generation" sequencing for TET2 aberrations, 91 of whom were also subjected to single-nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array karyotyping. Seventy-one TET2 mutations, with a relative mutation abundance (RMA) â‰¥ 10%, were identified in 39 of 320 (12%) myelodysplastic syndrome and 16 of 35 (46%) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients (P < .001). Interestingly, 4 patients had multiple mutations likely to exist as independent clones or on alternate alleles, suggestive of clonal evolution. "Deeper" sequencing of 96 patient samples identified 4 additional mutations (RMA, 3%-6.3%). Importantly, TET2 mutant clones were also found in T cells, in addition to CD34(+) and total bone marrow cells (23.5%, 38.5%, and 43% RMA, respectively). Only 20% of the TET2-mutated patients showed loss of heterozygosity at the TET2 locus. There was no difference in the frequency of genome-wide aberrations, TET2 expression, or the JAK2V617F 46/1 haplotype between TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients. There was no significant prognostic association between TET2 mutations and World Health Organization subtypes, International Prognostic Scoring System score, cytogenetic status, or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. On multivariate analysis, age (> 50 years) was associated with a higher incidence of TET2 mutation (P = .02).
