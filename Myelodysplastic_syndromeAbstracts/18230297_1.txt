 OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors involved in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: A 1:2 case-control study was conducted in 20 Shanghai' hospitals over a 3-year period, covering 266 "de novo" MDS cases corresponded to FAB criteria, and 532 age- and gender-matched controls from same hospitals with MDS cases. Subjects were all surveyed using the same standard questionnaire including histories of medications (Chloramphenicol, Sulfonamides, Meprobamate, Phenytoin, Colchicine, Cyclophosphamide, Propylthiouracil, Anti-TB medication, Tolbutamide, Primaquine and Chinese traditional herbs such as Bezoar, Angelica, Arsenic, Thunder cloud vine) at least 5 years prior to the onset of the disease, tumors, exposure to benzene, heavy metal, organic phosphates, pesticides, petrol/diesel, organic solvents, dye and hair dye products, radiation, house decorating, alcohol and smoking. RESULTS: Occupational exposure to benzene increased significantly the risk of MDS (OR: 8.52, 95% CI: 2.30 - 31.10). Living near high voltage power lines (100 m) increased significantly the risk of MDS (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.10 - 2.32). House decorating (one year prior to the onset of the disease) increased significantly the risk of MDS (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.38 - 4.14). Other investigated occupational poisons did not increase significantly the risk of MDS. Hair dye products, alcohol and smoking did not increase significantly the risk of MDS. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to benzene, living near high voltage power lines and house decorating are the risk factors of MDS.
