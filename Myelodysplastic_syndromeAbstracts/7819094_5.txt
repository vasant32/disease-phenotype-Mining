To validate scientifically our prior empiric observations that patients develop significant haemopoietic dysplasia following solid organ transplantation, we developed a quantitative lineage-specific scoring system to evaluate dysplastic features of bone marrow aspirates and core biopsies. We used this scoring system to compare retrospectively randomly selected bone marrow aspirates and core biopsies from 19 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), 21 with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and 18 with primary or chemotherapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Our results show that the OLT patient group developed significant but milder haemopoietic dysplastic changes than the HIV or MDS groups, and that the MDS group developed more severe dysplasia of the myeloid lineage than the other groups. The possible roles for drugs and infectious agents in the pathophysiology of dysplastic changes are discussed.
