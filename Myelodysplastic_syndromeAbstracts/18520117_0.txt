Duodenal diverticula generally occur in 2.5% of upper gastrointestinal examinations and are usually asymptomatic, but can cause hemorrhage on rare occasions. The frequency of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with MDS or hematologic neoplasm caused by duodenal diverticulum is not known. Therefore, the correct diagnosis of intestinal hemorrhage is important, as severe enterocolitis may cause a patient with MDS to bleed from the diverticulum.
