As a  zinc-finger protein, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) controls brown fat  determination by stimulating brown fat cell production while suppressing the  expression of genes for production of white fat cells; mutations in this domain  are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemogenesis. In our study,  polymorphisms in exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the PRDM16 gene were  detected by PCR-SSCP, DNA sequencing and CRS-PCR-RFLP methods in 1031 cattle of  the Chinese breeds: Jiaxian, Nanyang, Qinchuan, and Chinese Holstein. Three  mutations (NC_007314.3: g.577 G>T, 614 T>C, 212237 T>C) were detected.  Animals with the homozygote genotype had lower body weight and average daily  gain than those with the other genotypes. PRDM16 gene-specific SNPs may  be useful markers for growth traits for marker-assisted selection programs.
