Frequent apoptosis in the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was demonstrated on frozen sections using the terminal deoxytransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The overall mean percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was about 17% in the bone marrow of MDS, while bone marrow from control cases exhibited a mean of 3.4% (P < 0.001). To elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis in bone marrow cells of MDS, the expression of Fas antigen and Fas ligand (FasL) was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. All MDS cases showed expression of Fas mRNA (12/12) and most exhibited an expression of FasL mRNA (10/12) by RT-PCR. Basically, control cases did not show positive signals for Fas and FasL mRNA, however, a very weak band was detected in three cases (3/10) for Fas and in one case (1/10) for FasL mRNA by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for Fas (11/12) and FasL (12/12) in the bone marrow of MDS, while all the bone marrow samples from control cases were negative for anti-Fas (0/15) and for anti-FasL (0/15) antibody. Double staining clarified that TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells expressed Fas antigen on the cell surface, although not all Fas-positive cells were TUNEL positive. The Fas-positive cells of MDS bone marrow included hematopoietic cells expressing CD34 antigen, neutrophil elastase, a marker for myeloid series of cells, or glycophorin A, a marker for erythroid cells. However, CD68-positive cells which were macrophage lineage cells, did not express Fas antigen strongly. In contrast, positive staining for FasL was detected in hematopoietic cells and CD68-positive cells in the bone marrow of MDS. These results suggest that the Fas-FasL system plays an important role in inducing apoptosis in the bone marrow of MDS and works in an autocrine (hematopoietic cell-hematopoietic cell interaction) and/or paracrine (hematopoietic cell-stromal cell interaction) manner.
