Lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide and is FDA-approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma. Pulmonary toxicity with thalidomide is a recognized potential complication; however, there have only been two case reports in the literature of lenalidomide-associated pulmonary toxicity. In this case, we describe a patient who developed profound dyspnea, decreased exercisetolerance, and new ground-glass opacities with reticulation, consistent with a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern. Clinical suspicion for pulmonary drug toxicity was high and lenalidomide was discontinued. Within 2 weeks of stopping lenalidomide, the patient had significant improvement in dyspnea and interstitial changes on CT were resolving. After 8 weeks, there was complete resolution of symptoms. Lenalidomide-induced pulmonary toxicity is significantly debilitating but, to date, it appears to be reversible with discontinuation of the medication.
