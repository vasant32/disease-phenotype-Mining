Ten different tests of blood neutrophil function were studied in 20 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (PMDS). The patients were selected according to the new diagnostic criteria for PMDS of the FAB-cooperation group. Impairments of granulocyte functions were found in all patients. Moreover, several steps in the mobilization of granulocytes at the site of injury seemed to be affected: decreased adhesion (P less than 0.05), deficient chemotaxis (P less than 0.05), decreased enzyme content (P less than 0.001), 'slower' chemiluminescence (P less than 0.005), decreased phagocytosis (P less than 0.05) and impaired microbicidal capacity (P less than 0.025). No significant correlation between disease category and severity of granulocyte dysfunction was discerned, though an increasing number of blasts was associated with more severe granulocytic disability. Results in seven patients with abnormal karyotypes were not significantly different from 13 others with normal karyotypes. Our results indicate that defects in blood neutrophil function are a common feature in PMDS and might account for the increased frequency of infection in these patients.
