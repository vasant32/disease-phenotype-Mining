Malignant myeloblasts arising in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are characterized by the constitutive activation of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NFkappaB. We found that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors (such as azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (such as trichostatin and valproic acid) efficiently induced apoptosis in the P39 MDS/AML cell line, correlating with an inhibition of NFkappaB (which translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm). This effect was obtained rapidly, within a few hours, suggesting that it was not due to epigenetic reprogramming. Indeed, DNMT and HDAC inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of the NFkappaB-activating kinase IKKalpha/beta, and this effect was also observed in enucleated cells. Finally, circulating myeloblasts from AML patients treated with the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine manifested a rapid (2 hours post-treatment) inhibition of NFkappaB and IKKalpha/beta. Altogether, these results indicate that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors can inhibit the constitutive activation of NFkappaB in malignant myeloblasts in vitro and in vivo through a novel mechanism.
