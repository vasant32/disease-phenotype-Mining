We treated 21 elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplasia (n = 14) or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 7) with 2 mg of melphalan orally once a day until a complete peripheral response was obtained or until there was evidence of treatment failure. We observed seven (30%) complete and two (10%) partial peripheral responses occurring within 4-16 weeks and lasting for 12 + to 55 weeks. In relapse, retreatment was successful in most of the patients. Responses were associated with the absence of complex cytogenetic abnormalities and with a normal or reduced bone marrow cellularity.
