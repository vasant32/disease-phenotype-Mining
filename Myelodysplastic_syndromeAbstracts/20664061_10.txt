Transformation of Philadelphia (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and short survival. Fifty-four patients with Ph-negative MPN (including 21 essential thrombocythemia [ET], 21 polycythemia vera [PV], 7 primary myelofibrosis, and 5 unclassified MPN) who had progressed to AML (n = 26) or MDS (n = 28) were treated with azacitidine in a patient-named program. Overall response rate was 52% (24% complete response [CR], 11% partial response [PR], 8% marrow CR or CR with incomplete recovery of cytopenias, 9% hematologic improvement) and median response duration was 9 months. Prognostic factors were for overall response the underlying MPN (71% vs 33% responses in ET and PV, respectively; P = .016); prognostic factors for CR achievement were the underlying MPN (14% CR for PV vs 43% for ET; P = .040) and World Health Organization classification at transformation (36% vs 12% CR in MDS and AML, respectively, P = .038). Recurrence of chronic phase features of the initial MPN was observed in 39% of the responders. Median overall survival was 11 months. Azacitidine gives encouraging results in Ph-negative MPN having progressed to AML or MDS, but response duration is short, and consolidation treatments have to be evaluated.
