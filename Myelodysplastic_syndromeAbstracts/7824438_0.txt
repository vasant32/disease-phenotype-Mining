The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55%). The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis. Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients. Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses. Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.
