We have used statistical models based on Fourier transform-infrared spectra to differentiate between the DNA structure of normal granulocytes and those obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The substantial degree of discrimination achieved between the two DNA groups is attributed to differences in the nucleotide base and backbone structures. These structural differences allowed for the development of a discriminant analysis model that predicted, with high sensitivity and specificity, which DNA came from normal granulocytes vs. granulocytes from MDS patients. The findings are a promising basis for developing a blood test to diagnose and predict the occurrence of MDS, for which there is currently a paucity of molecular markers.
