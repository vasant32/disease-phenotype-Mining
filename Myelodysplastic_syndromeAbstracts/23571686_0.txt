Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is an uncommon, but potentially fatal, bleeding diathesis caused by autoantibodies against circulating coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The incidence is approximately 0.15 cases per 100â€Š000 person-years. The underlying causes of AHA can be identified in approximately half of the patients, of which malignancies account for 10-20%. Heretofore, there has been only one case report of AHA concomitant with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMMoL), which previously was a subtype of the myelodysplastic syndrome. In this article, we report two more cases of AHA with CMMoL in our hospital and review possible causal relations between these two rare blood disorders.
