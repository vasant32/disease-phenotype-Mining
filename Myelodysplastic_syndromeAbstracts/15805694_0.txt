We present a 30-year-old man admitted with generalized cutaneous lesions, fever and cough. Examination of skin biopsies of a papular lesion revealed dense neutrophilic infiltration of the upper dermis, so these lesions were diagnosed as neutrophilic dermatosis. Peripheral blood examination and bone marrow findings confirmed the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts. The cutaneous lesions improved after administration of corticosteroid and follow-up bone marrow examination revealed a normocellular marrow. One year later he referred with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M0). Unfortunately, he did not respond to treatment and died a few months later due to disease progression.
