Efficacy of fluconazole (FLCZ), an anti-fungal agent of triazole derivatives, was evaluated in patients with systemic mycoses and suspected mycoses associated with hematologic malignancies including leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and malignant lymphoma. Plasma beta-D-glycan levels, the differences between the levels determined toxicolor test and in endospecy test, were also investigated. Fourteen patients with systemic mycoses and 31 patients with suspected mycotic infections were treated with intravenous administration of FLCZ at a daily dose of 400 mg. Excellent to good responses were observed in 4 of the 14 patients (28.6%) with definitive diagnosis of mycosis, and in 18 of the 31 patients (58.1%) with suspected fungal infections, with an overall efficacy rate of 48.9% (22/45). Levels of plasma beta-D-glycan correlated well with efficacies of FLCZ in 19 of 30 patients. In several cases, however, plasma beta-D-glucan levels were low during the entire course of treatment. Even in 10 cases of definite mycosis, 4 cases showed low levels of plasma beta-D-glucan (below 15 pg/ml by repeated determinations). The results indicate that FLCZ is an effective agent for the treatment of severe systemic fungal infections in patients with hematologic disorders. Deep seated mycosis cannot be ruled out even when its plasma levels of beta-D-glucan are low.
