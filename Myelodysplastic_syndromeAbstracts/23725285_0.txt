Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias. Different processes are involved in its pathogenesis, such as (epi)genetic alterations and immunological dysfunctions. The nature of immune dysregulation is markedly different between various MDS risk groups. In low-risk MDS, the immune system is in a proinflammatory state, whereas in high-risk disease, immunosuppressive features facilitate expansion of the dysplastic clone and can eventually lead to disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Various cell types contribute to dysregulation of immune responses in MDS. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important regulators of immunity. However, the role of DCs in MDS has yet to be elucidated. It has been suggested that impaired DC function can hamper adequate immune responses. This review focuses on the involvement of DCs in immune dysregulation in low- and high-risk MDS and the implications for DC-targeted therapies.
