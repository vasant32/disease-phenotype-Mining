We studied dysplastic features in peripheral blood polymorphs from 80 patients with acute leukaemia. Thirty-seven patients with de novo acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) were compared to 26 patients with AML that had developed after a myelodysplastic phase (MDS-AML), and 17 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Cytoplasmic hypogranulation in neutrophils, measured as a score value (G-score; normal range: 255-300), and the percentage of pelgeroid polymorphs (ppp; normal range: 0.5%) were studied retrospectively by reviewing the diagnostic peripheral blood smears. The mean G-score was decreased in MDS-AML (178 +/- 67.9), and in de novo AML (212 +/- 65.1), but not in ALL (275 +/- 24.3). When de novo AML patients were divided by age, the elderly (greater than 60 yr) had significantly (p = 0.0001) lower mean G-score than the younger (less than 45 yr) ones; 156 +/- 64.8 v 243 +/- 41.4. This age-related difference became accentuated when only patients with extreme hypogranulation (G-score less than 150) were studied. Elderly de novo AML patients also had significantly (p = 0.0057) higher mean ppp. By studying the degree of polymorph dysplasia in the peripheral blood, it seems possible to identify a subset of dysplastic elderly AML patients, who might have passed a (preleukaemic) MDS phase unnoticed.
