 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aeromonas spp. often cause infections in immunocompromised patients. To specifically understand the clinical features of Aeromonas bacteremic adults with hematologic malignancies, we investigated the demographic, clinical and microbiologic characteristics of Aeromonas bacteremia in this patient population. METHODS: Retrospective study performed in a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan, in which adults with hematologic malignancies suffered from Aeromonas bacteremia admitted between 1995 and 2003 were included for study. RESULTS: There were 45 episodes of Aeromonas bacteremia in 41 adults with hematologic malignancies. Episodes of Aeromonas bacteremia which occurred at least 2 months apart were counted as separate cases in the analysis. A total of 30 men and 15 women (mean age: 53.2 years), with 4 patients experiencing 2 episodes, was included. The 3 leading underlying hematologic malignancies were acute myelogenous leukemia (37.8%), myelodysplastic syndrome (26.7%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (17.8%). No cluster of Aeromonas bacteremia was found during the study period. Twenty nine (64.4%) of the 31 patients with nosocomial Aeromonas bacteremia had received recent antineoplastic chemotherapy. The 3 leading clinical manifestations were fever (88.9%), septic shock (40%), and altered consciousness (26.7%). Eleven (24.4%) episodes of bacteremia were polymicrobial. Sixteen (35.6%) patients died within 14 days of onset of bacteremia. The mean duration from sampling blood for culture to death was 3.81 days. Altered consciousness (odds ratio, 8.999; 95% confidence interval, 1.787-45.33; p=0.008) was the only independent prognostic factor for mortality. High resistance rates (11.1% to piperacillin and 35.6% to imipenem) among Aeromonas isolates were also noted. CONCLUSION: In febrile patients with hematologic malignancies and suspected Aeromonas infections, particular attention to the development of alteration of consciousness is needed as it is an independent risk factor for mortality.
