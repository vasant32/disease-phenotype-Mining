To evaluate the efficacy of cyclosporine (CYA) regimens in preventing moderate to severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 25 patients received immunosuppressive therapy consisting of either CYA and methylprednisolone or CYA and methotrexate (MTX) and the incidence and severity of acute GVHD was compared. These patients had leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and received bone marrow transplants (BMT) from genotypically HLA-identical siblings. The incidence of grade I-IV acute GVHD in patients on the CYA/methylprednisolone regimen was 64% (7 of 11) compared with 50% (7 of 14) in those on the CYA/MTX regimen. Five of 11 patients with the CYA/methylprednisolone regimen developed moderate to severe acute GVHD (grade II-IV), fatal in 3 cases. No patient on the CYA/MTX regimen developed moderate to severe acute GVHD. Engraftment was faster in the CYA/methylprednisolone group than in the CYA/MTX group. The incidence of toxicity observed soon after BMT was comparable between groups. The CYA/MTX regimen may be superior to the CYA/methylprednisolone regimen for preventing moderate to severe acute GVHD.
