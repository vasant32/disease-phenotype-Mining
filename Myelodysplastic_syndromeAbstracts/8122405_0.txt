Activity of polyadenylate polymerase was studied in blood serum of patients with some forms of leukemia. In acute form of leukemia, the activity of the polymerase was increased 3-fold in blood serum as compared with normal state. Under conditions of chronic myeloleukemia the enzymatic activity was altered depending on the disease step with increase in leukemia development and reached the maximal values in blast crisis. The maximal enzymatic activity was found in myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with refractory anemia and excess of blasts.
