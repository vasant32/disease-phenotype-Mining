The PRV-1 gene has been proposed as a marker of polycythaemia vera (PV). PRV-1 and NB1 are alleles of the polymorphic gene CD177, which belongs to the Ly-6/uPAR superfamily, and their coding regions differ at only four nucleotides. We studied neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels in normal subjects and in 235 patients with Ph-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD), including PV, essential thrombocythaemia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Additional disease states were investigated for comparison. Highly variable neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels were observed in normal individuals. Neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow, or from peripheral blood following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration showed markedly higher CD177 expression than circulating granulocytes on steady state. Increased neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels were detected in all CMD. Elevated values were also found in reactive conditions and in disorders such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. In the differential diagnosis between PV and secondary erythrocytosis, the assay sensitivity was 68% while its specificity was 60%. These findings indicate that an elevated neutrophil CD177 mRNA level is not a specific marker for the diagnosis of PV nor for that of CMD. From a clinical viewpoint, neutrophil CD177 mRNA overexpression is rather a marker of abnormal neutrophil production and/or release in patients with CMD.
