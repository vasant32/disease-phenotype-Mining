 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the HLA-DRB1 polymorphism with susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and aplastic anemia (AA) in Chinese Han population. METHODS: The polymorphism of HLA-DRB1 alleles in 242 patients with MDS, 115 patients with AA and 2264 umbilical cord blood control samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP). RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly increased in the MDS group and AA group (22.93% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square = 9.662, OR= 1.428, P= 0.003; 26.52% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square = 12.924, OR= 1.732, P= 0.001). And this is mainly due to the increase in the male patients in both patient groups: in the MDS males, 24.68% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square= 11.194, OR= 1.572, P= 0.001, and in the AA males, 29.29% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square= 13.563, OR= 1.987, P= 0.001. No significant difference between the controls and the female patients in both groups was observed. CONCLUSION: The HLA-DRB1*15 could be a susceptibility allele for MDS and AA male patients.
