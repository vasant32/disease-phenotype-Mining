A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed as having refractory anemia (RA) with CREST syndrome (incomplete type). She showed Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia, but not calcinosis and esophageal dysmotility. Laboratory findings revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia, and myelodysplasia, abnormal karyotype of 47, XX, +8 in bone marrow cells. Antinuclear and centromere antibody was positive. Treatment with prednisolone was not successful. After prednisolone was tapered, she was given 20 mg/body metenolone orally, which led to hematological improvement, and after 6 months of therapy, abnormal karyotype of 47, XX, +8 disappeared.
