Patients with trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS) in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis and remission were clinically evaluated between 1983 and 1996. AML with TMDS (AML/TMDS) was observed in 20 (12%) of 162 patients with de novo AML at diagnosis. Complete remission (CR) was achieved with combination chemotherapy in 12 (67%) of 18 AML/TMDS cases. This CR rate was relatively worse than the rate of 78% (106/136 cases) of AML without TMDS, but this difference was not significant. Disease-free survival curves also showed no difference between AML/TMDS and AML without TMDS. During remission, eight (67%) of 12 AML/TMDS cases had myelodysplastic remission marrow (AML/MRM). AML/MRM was also seen in seven (7%) of 106 AML cases without TMDS. The actuarial disease-free survival was significantly lower in AML/MRM than in AML without MRM (P = 0.0003). All of the AML/MRM cases exhibited early leukaemic relapse; median remission duration was only 9 months. Clonal changes occurred in two cases of AML/TMDS and five cases of AML/MRM at the time of relapse. These findings suggest that TMDS during remission predicts a poorer prognosis and early leukaemic relapse when compared with the absence of TMDS.
