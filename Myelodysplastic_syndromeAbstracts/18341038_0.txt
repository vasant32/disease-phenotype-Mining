We report that granulocyte transfusion (GTX) was effective for prolonged pneumonia at allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A 58-year-old man with MDS-RAEB-2 was admitted to our hospital for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He was complicated with pneumonia, which was not improved with G-CSF and antibiotics. We therefore decided to perform a GTX transplantation. During the period of neutropenia, pneumonia did not deteriorate. A combination of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and GTX is expected not only to improve transplantation results but also to expand the adaptation for transplantation. However, detailed investigation of the effect of GTX in allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be performed, and more cases should be accumulated.
