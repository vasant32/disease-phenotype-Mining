Antifungal prophylaxis in the haematological patient is currently regarded as the gold standard in situations with a high risk of infection, such as acute leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and autologous or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Over the years, different scientific societies have established a series of recommendations on antifungal prophylaxis based on prospective studies performed with different drugs. However, the prescription of each one of the agents must be personalised, adapted to the characteristics of each patient and to possible interactions with concomitant medication.
