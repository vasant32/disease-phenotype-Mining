Umbilical cord-blood transplantation is considered an effective treatment strategy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor is unavailable. The use of a second unit helps ensure engraftment in larger adults and those with comorbidities, even though only one unit engrafts in most patients. Herein, we present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of a patient who developed donor-derived myelodysplastic syndrome (ddMDS) after double umbilical cord-blood transplantation (dUCB HSCT). To our knowledge, no cases of ddMDS have been described in a patient with a history of ALL in molecular remission after receiving a dUCB HSCT. Current molecular techniques, including analysis of short tandem repeats (STR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allowed us to firmly establish donor origin.
