 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of CD133 in the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and explore its clinical significance. METHODS: The expression of CD133 and CD34/CD38 in the bone marrow was detected using flow cytometry in 31 cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 10 cases of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) and 11 cases of aplastic anemia (AA). RESULTS: The percentage of CD133-expressing cells was 6.75% in patients with RAEB, significantly higher than that in patients with RCMD (1.41%) and AA (2.70%) (P<0.05); the percentage of CD133-positive cells were similar between the latter two patient groups (P>0.05). The percentage of CD34(+)/CD38- cells was similar in the 3 groups (P>0.05), all lower than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced MDS patients are characterized by an increase of CD133-expressing cells, suggesting the value of CD133 in the diagnosis of RAEB. CD34(+)/CD38- cells do not show a significant value in the diagnosis of MDS.
