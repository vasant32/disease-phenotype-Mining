After allo-SCT, analysis of CD34(+) lineage-specific donor cell chimerism (DCC) is a sensitive method for monitoring minimal residual disease in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with CD34 expression. To substantiate evidence of whether immune interventions in patients with impending relapse, defined by incomplete lineage-specific DCC, may prevent hematological relapse, we performed a retrospective nested case control study. Unsorted and lineage-specific DCC were measured in 134 patients. Forty-three patients had an incomplete CD34(+)-DCC with no other evidence of relapse. After immediate tapering of immunosuppressive treatment (30 patients) and/or infusion of donor lymphocytes (10 patients), 21 patients remained in remission (conversion to complete lineage-specific DCC) and 22 relapsed. Relapse-free survival at 3 years of the 91 patients with stable DCC and of the 43 patients with incomplete DCC was 74% (95% confidence interval (CI), 64-83%) and 40% (95% CI, 24-58%), respectively. OS rates were 79% (95% CI, 70-88%) and 52% (95% CI, 35-69%), respectively. These results, with 49% of patients with impending relapse successfully treated with immune intervention, highly suggest that analysis of CD34(+)-DCC is an important tool for monitoring and the management of AML and MDS patients after allo-SCT.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 4 February 2013; doi:10.1038/bmt.2013.2.
