In BMT patients, shedding of BK virus (BKV) in the urine has been strongly but not absolutely correlated to hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). The possible presence of human polyomaviruses in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), plasma, serum and urine in BMT patients and an association with HC was investigated by a nested PCR assay. Samples from allogeneic BMT patients with and without HC as well as from autologous BMT patients were analyzed. Human polyomaviruses were detected in urine and blood samples of both allogeneic and autologous BMT patients with and without HC. An association between the presence of a specific human polyomavirus in blood and HC was thus not observed.
