We present a short report here of two more patients with trisomy 2 as the sole chromosomal abnormality in a hematologic malignancy. Although trisomy 2 is a recognized abnormality in neoplasms, particularly hepatoblastomas, to the best of our knowledge only three other cases have been reported with trisomy 2, in patients with a hematologic malignancy. The two cases presented here of myelodysplastic syndrome transforming to acute myeloblastic leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showed trisomy 2 as the sole abnormality.
