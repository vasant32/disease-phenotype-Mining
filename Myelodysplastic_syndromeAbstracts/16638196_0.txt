The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition effect of arsenic sulfide (As2S2) on the growth of in vitro cultured BMMNC from MDS patients and to explore its possible cellular and molecular mechanisms. The apoptosis of MDS cells induced by As2S2 solution of different concentrations were studied with MTT, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR. The results showed that (1) low concentration of As2S2 (0-0.6 mg/L) had no marked inhibition effect on proliferation of MDS cells; (2) after treatment with 1.5-50 mg/L of As2S2, both low risk MDS cells and high risk MDS cells presented typical features of apoptosis with a dose-dependent manner, the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and the ratio of bcl-2/bax obviously decreased after As2S2 treatment (P < 0.05); (3) BMMNC from MDS patients had higher apoptosis ratio than that of BMMNC from control. It is concluded that BMMNC excessive apoptosis exists in MDS patients; low concentration of As2S2 (0-0.6 mg/L) shows no inhibition effect on proliferation of MDS cells; high concentration of As2S2 (1.5-50 mg/L) induces apoptosis of MDS cells.
