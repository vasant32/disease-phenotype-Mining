Chloroma is a tumour composed of immature granulocytes localized in extramedullary tissues. Chloroma is noted in the course of the acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) during their transformation in the acute leukemias. Due to chloroma infrequency, two cases seen at the Department of Hematology, Medical Academy in Warsaw are presented. A survey of the actual literature is included.
