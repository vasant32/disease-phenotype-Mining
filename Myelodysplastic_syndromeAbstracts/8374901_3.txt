A 30-year-old Chinese man with acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura (AATP) and a Ph chromosome is reported. At presentation, he had severe thrombocytopenia resulting in epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and ecchymoses, while other hematologic values were within the normal range. Bone marrow aspiration showed no megakaryocytes, with a normal appearance of erythroblastic and granulopoietic series. He failed to respond to prednisone treatment, and underwent a progress from isolated thrombocytopenia to full pancytopenia. At last he died of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. An in vitro culture for granulocyte-macrophage precursors showed very few colonies. Karyotypic analysis revealed a standard Ph chromosome translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), in the majority of bone marrow cells. Southern blot analysis using a 3' bcr-HE probe didn't detect a rearrangement within the bcr DNA sequence. This patient, in fact, was a myelodysplastic disorder, initially presenting as AATP. The diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia was excluded on the basis of clinical and hematologic findings. The heterogeneity of Ph chromosome in myelodysplastic syndrome is discussed.
