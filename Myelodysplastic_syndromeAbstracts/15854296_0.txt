This study was aimed to establish a cytokine-independent human myelodysplastic cells line from bone marrow of a patient with MDS-CMML. This cell line was incubated in mixed culture of RPMI 1640 and DMEM with 15% bovine serum, but without cytokines; its biological characteristics were identified by morphology, surface marker profiles, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The results showed that the established cell line could not depend on cytokines for long-term survival and growth, and could differentiate into colony-forming unit-macrophage, colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte. In conclusion, a cytokine-independent human myelodysplastic syndrome cell line, named MDS-JSN04 (MDS Nanjing Jiansu 04), was established. Its partial biological characteristics were identified and clarified.
