We investigated the incidence of post-transplant solid tumors in a cohort of 109 patients who had undergone auto-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 18), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 52), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), multiple myeloma (n = 16), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 3) and solid tumors (n = 7). The patients were followed up for a median of 32 months after PBSCT. Five second solid malignancies developed in 4 patients within 14 to 43 months after PBSCT: large cell carcinoma of the lung, adenocarcinoma of the rectum, cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver, squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth, and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. The affected patients were 3 of 52 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one of 16 with multiple myeloma. One of the patients was in the 5th decade of life (n = 31) and 3 were in the 6th decade (n = 31). The cumulative actuarial risk for developing post-transplant solid tumors was 8% at 8 years. Elderly patients (> or = 60 year old) who have undergone PBSCT need to be observed carefully for second neoplasms because of their increased risk of post-transplant solid tumors.
