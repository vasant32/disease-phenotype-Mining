We analyzed the relationship between autoantibody and dermatosis in 22 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These MDS patients consisted of five cases with refractory anemia (RA), three RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), eight RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), four RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and two chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) according to the FAB classification of MDS. The autoantibody was detected in seven patients, of whom four had rheumatoid factor (RF) and three had antinuclear antibody (ANA). Neither RF-positive nor ANA-positive MDS patients had other autoantibodies. Dermatosis was observed in nine cases of these 22 MDS patients. Five of 7 MDS patients (71%) with autoantibody developed dermatosis in their clinical course, as did four of 15 MDS patients (27%) without autoantibody. All four MDS patients with RF had dermatosis such as anaphylactoid purpura, xerotic dermatitis, thrombophlebitis, ephelides, and genital herpes. One of three MDS patients with ANA had pruritus senilis. The four MDS patients without autoantibody had dermatosis such as erythema nodosum, ichthyosis vulgaris, Sweet syndrome, and thrombophlebitis. Three of four MDS patients with RF had normal liver function tests, while three MDS patients with ANA showed liver dysfunction. Our studies presented here suggested that the dermatosis could develop frequently in MDS patients with autoantibody and that RF was closely related to development of dermatosis in MDS patients, although the dermatosis is not specially fixed.
