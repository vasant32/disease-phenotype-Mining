PURPOSE: Myelofibrosis is a common, poor-prognosis feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The aim of this work was to evaluate quantitatively the extent of the juxtatrabecular fibrosis in primary MDS and in secondary myelodysplasias, along with the presence of immature precursor cells in anomalous position, that is, the displacement of granulopoiesis from the paratrabecular area to central positions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven bone marrow samples were examined: 9 from primary MDS, 9 from secondary myelodysplasias, and 9 normal. The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes with nucleoli located in the central areas was estimated, in an attempt to correlate such feature with the degree of juxtatrabecular fibrosis. The analysis of data was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, values of p < 0.01 being significant. RESULTS: Sectorial juxtatrabecular fibrosis was present in all the myelodysplastic samples, ranging from 6% to 55% of the trabecular surface; the highest values found in the controls were about 3.6% (p < 0.01). Although the juxtatrabecular fibrosis figures are higher in secondary MDS, the difference is not significant with regard to the primary MDS in the number of patients studied here. The count of myeloblasts and promyelocytes with nucleoli present in the MDS was significantly greater than that of the control group. The number of promyelocytes with nucleoli was significantly higher in the primary MDS with respect to the secondary ones, whereas no significant difference was seen between the two types of MDS regarding the myeloblast count. CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of central immature precursor cells in MDS was not directly correlated with the extent of the juxtatrabecular fibrosis. Although the number of cases is small, the fact that the juxtatrabecular fibrosis was higher in the two deceased patients in the series (49% and 56%, respectively) suggests a poor-risk prognosis for such finding.
