Megakaryocytic colony formation by precursor cells from the bone marrow was investigated in 10 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome. All but one exhibited abnormal colony formation: four showed no colony formation at all, while a decreased number of colonies was noticed in five. All of the patients showed defective colony formation by erythroid progenitors, but only four showed clearly abnormal granulocyte-macrophage colony formation. The defect in megakaryocytic progenitors seems to be more akin to the defects occurring in erythroid progenitors than to the defects seen in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage.
