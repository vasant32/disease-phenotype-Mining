Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 60 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes--diagnosed, treated, and followed in our department. In 41 cases, the presence of the NRAS mutation was also evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of chromosomal abnormalities and NRAS mutation. The median age of the patients was 67 years (18-88 years), and the French-American-British classification was as follows: refractory anemia 26, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts 4, refractory anemia with excess of blast cells 15, refractory anemia with excess of blast cells in transformation 3, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 12. Survival analysis was performed for the patients with a normal (n = 35), an abnormal (n = 25) karyotype and with a single (n = 15) or multiple (n = 10) cytogenetic abnormalities. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 25 of the 60 patients (41.6%). Fifteen of these patients had a single and 10 had two or more lesions. The median survival of the patients with a normal (33.1 months) and with an abnormal (36.5 months) karyotype was not significantly different. Patients with multiple lesions had a reduced median survival compared with patients with single anomalies (19.2 versus 39.7 months, p = 0.5). Patients with an abnormal karyotype progressed to acute leukemia more frequently compared with patients without lesions (36 versus 28.6%, p = 0.5). NRAS mutation was detected in 2 of 10 CMMoL patients studied and in none of the 31 patients with other types of myelodysplastic syndrome. Marrow blasts more than 10% significantly affected survival.
