Bone marrow progenitor cell assays of three cell lineages, i.e., colony-forming unit megakaryocytes (CFU-Meg), burst-forming unit erythrocytes (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages (CFU-GM), were performed for 21 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Markedly reduced or absent colony formation was found in 67% of the patients for CFU-Meg and all patients except 2 with refractory anemia (RA) for BFU-E. Abnormal CFU-GM colony formation was found in only 5 of 12 patients with RA and RA with ring sideroblasts, in contrast to all of the RA patients with excess of blasts and excess of blasts in transformation. Defective colony formation of all three cell lineages was seen in 63% of the MDS patients. The colony number of CFU-Meg correlated significantly with the numbers of both BFU-E and CFU-GM. These findings indicate that hematopoiesis in MDS patients is disturbed due to a qualitative or quantitative defect at the multipotent stem cell level.
