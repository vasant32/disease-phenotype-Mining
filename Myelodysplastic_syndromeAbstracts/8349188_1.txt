BACKGROUND: It has recently been demonstrated that erythropoietin increases hemoglobin levels in anemia secondary to chronic renal failure. Some recent experiences have suggested a possible role in the treatment of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS AND RESULTS: From April, 1990 to March, 1991, 16 patients (11 males and 5 females, median age 58.5 years) affected by low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to ameliorate Hb levels and reduce transfusional requirement. All patients received high doses of rHuEPO (400 U/Kg s.c. twice weekly for 3 months). A partial response, defined as a stable increase in Hb levels > 1g/dL and/or a reduction in transfusional need > 50% lasting at least 3 months, was achieved by 5/16 patients. Those who responded received an additional course of treatment with rHuEPO at an increased dosage (600 U/Kg twice weekly for 3 months), and one of these five showed a progressive rise in Hb level up to normalization, while the other 4 remained stable. The treatment was well tolerated and no adverse reactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that some patients with MDS may benefit from rHuEPO treatment.
