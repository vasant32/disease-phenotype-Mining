The presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation is now part of clinical diagnostic algorithms, and JAK2 status is routinely assessed when BCR/ABL- chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are suspected. The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of 3 screening and 1 quantitative method for JAK2 V617F detection. For the study, 43 samples (27 bone marrow aspirates and 16 peripheral blood samples) were selected. The screening assays were the JAK2 Activating Mutation Assay (InVivoScribe, San Diego, CA), JAK2 MutaScreen kit (Ipsogen, Luminy Biotech, Marseille, France), and a home-brew melting curve analysis method. Ipsogen's JAK2 MutaQuant assay was used for quantification of mutant and wild-type alleles. The limit of detection was 1% for the kit-based screening methods and 10% for the melting curve method. The JAK2 MutaQuant assay demonstrated analytic sensitivity of 0.01%. All 4 methods detected cases of BCR/ABL- MPNs and gave negative results with BCR/ABL+ chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and normal cases.
