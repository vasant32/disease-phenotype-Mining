We describe 41 cases of myeloid neoplasms (MNs) secondary to plasma cell myeloma (PCM). The types of MN included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 34 (82.9%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 4 (9.8%), and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or MDS/MPN in 3 (7.3%) cases. The latency from treatment to diagnosis of MN ranged from 9 to 384 months, with a median of 60 months. Of 37 cases with cytogenetic studies, complex abnormalities were detected in 22 (59.5%), -5(q)/-7(q) in 4 (10.8%), other abnormalities in 8 (21.6%), and normal karyotype in 3 (8.1%) cases. Complex abnormalities and -5(q)/-7(q) correlated directly with multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, particularly with combined melphalan/cyclophosphamide. Moreover, the features of cytogenetic abnormalities in our series were significantly different from those with concomitant PCM/MN who had significantly lower complex abnormalities. The latency, skewed proportion of MDS, and bias toward complex cytogenetic abnormalities/unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5/7 suggested an alkylating mutagenic effect on pathogenesis of secondary MN. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a median survival of 19 months, which was better than that for therapy-related (t)-MDS/AML. In contrast to t-MDS, the survival in our patients appeared to depend on subtypes of MDS as seen in de novo diseases.
