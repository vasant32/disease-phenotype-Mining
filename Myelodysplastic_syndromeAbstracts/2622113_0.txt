The paper presented a case of a patient with type III by FAB myelodysplastic syndrome, in whom during a low dose cytarabine therapy ventricular fibrillation occurred. Authors discussed roles of anemia, ischemic heart disease and hypokalemia as factors which could increase circulatory system sensitivity on cytarabine action.
