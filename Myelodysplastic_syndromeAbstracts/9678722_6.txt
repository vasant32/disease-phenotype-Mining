In recent years, many cytokines have been defined and some of them used clinically. In hematological malignancies, cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been widely used for leukopenia after chemotherapy. However, in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), some leukemic cells may be induced to proliferate by these cytokines and they must be used with care. In this study, we have investigated cell reactivity and proliferation with G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CMF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO) in cases of AML. We have also investigated the reactivity of some myeloid leukemia cell lines to TPO. G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, SCF and TPO caused proliferation of leukemic cells in 25%, 58.3%, 8.3%, 21.1% and 0% of cases, respectively. Because of this result, the use of G-CSF in AML should be regarded as potentially hazardous. TPO did not cause proliferation of leukemic cells in any case of AML, or in cell lines except MO7E, which is a megakaryocytic cell line. This result suggests that TPO might cause proliferation of some megakaryocytic leukemia cells. We cannot conclude that TPO does not cause proliferation of other AML cells, as the number of cases was small and it has been reported elsewhere that leukemia cells may proliferate when exposed to TPO in 50% of AML cases. Reactivity of AM L cells to TPO is an important factor when deciding the indications of TPO in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome.
