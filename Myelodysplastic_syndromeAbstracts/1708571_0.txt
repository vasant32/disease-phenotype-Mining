Blast-cells in Romanowsky-Giemsa stained bone marrow smears from 14 cases of primary myelodysplastic syndrome which consequently developed an acute myeloid leukemia and 28 cases of primary acute myeloid leukemia were analysed by a computer aided high resolution pattern recognition system. As control we used blast-cells from reactive affected bone marrow. Whereas blast-cell types in MDS and secondary AML showed overlapping features and a heterogenous distribution we could distinguish blasts in primary AML compared to "reactive" blasts. Opposite to this blasts in secondary AML showed no different pattern compared to "reactive" blast.
