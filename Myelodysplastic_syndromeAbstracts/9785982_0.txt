A 77-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome required platelet transfusion. However, she complained of facial flushing and dyspnea immediately after the initiation of an infusion of platelet concentrations (PC) utilizing a Pall PL-PXL8H filter with a negatively charged surface. The same symptoms recurred following a transfusion of washed PC with saline. However, an infusion utilizing a Sepacell PLX5A-W with a positively charged surface caused no problems. Furthermore, the patient demonstrated the same adverse reaction after administration of prostaglandin F2 alpha. This case suggested that special caution is warranted when patients who have an allergic history receive PC infusions through leukocyte-reduction filters with negatively charged surfaces.
