We report on the outcomes of 53 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia secondary to MDS, autografted in first complete remission. Five (9.4%) died from the procedure whereas hematological reconstitution occurred in all the remaining patients. Forty patients (75%) relapsed, with 87.5% of the relapses occurring within 2 years of the autologous transplant. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, the median actuarial disease-free survival and overall survival were 8 and 17 months after autograft, respectively. Karyotype was the only prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. The eight survivors (15%), including two patients with unfavorable or intermediate karyotype, remained in first complete remission 50+ to 119+ months after transplantation and are probably cured.
