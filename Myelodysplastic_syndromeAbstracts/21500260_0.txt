The effects of reducing the pulse repetition time from 2500 ms to 1000 ms when using spin-density-projection-assisted R2-magnetic resonance imaging for the purpose of measuring liver iron concentration were evaluated. Repeated liver R2 measurements were made using both protocols on 60 subjects with liver iron concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48.6 mg Fe (g dry tissue)(-1). The mean total scan time at repetition time 1000 ms was 42% of that at repetition time 2500 ms. The repeatability coefficients for the two protocols were not significantly different from each other. A systematic difference in the measured R2 using each protocol was found indicating that an adjustment factor is required when one protocol is used to replace the other. The 95% limits of agreement between the two protocols were not significantly different from their repeatability coefficients indicating that the protocols can be interchanged without any significant change in accuracy or precision of liver iron concentration measurement.
