It may sometimes be difficult to diagnose low risk MDS in patients with mild cytopenia. We report on 10 patients with mild to marked, unexplained cytopenia without definitive signs of a myeloid neoplasm. In two patients, a karyotype-abnormality (trisomy 14; monosomy 7) was detected in a small subset of bone marrow cells. Progression to overt MDS was seen in two patients including the one with monosomy 7. In the remaining cases, no MDS developed in a follow-up of at least 6 months. The phrase "idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS)", as also suggested by Mufti and co-workers, is proposed and long term follow-up is recommended to assess the evolution.
