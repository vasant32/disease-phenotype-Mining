To investigate the kind of morphological dysplastic changes important in the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we examined 50 patients with MDS and 86 control subjects. Micromegakaryocytes and pseudo-Pelger-HuÃ«t anomalies were detected in 46 patients (92%) with MDS, and were also found in the differentiated types of acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, but not in other haematological disorders, or healthy subjects. We believe that evaluation of these changes would be helpful in diagnosing MDS.
