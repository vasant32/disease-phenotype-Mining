A phase-I/II trial was initiated to study the effect of rhGM-CSF in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who were not eligible for other kinds of therapy, rhGM-CSF was given to 9 patients in doses of 15 micrograms/m2-150 micrograms/m2 as an intravenous 8-h infusion for a cycle of 7 days followed by an interval of 14 days and a second 7-day treatment course. A dose-dependent increase in the leukocyte count was observed in 7 out of 9 patients. No change in reticulocyte numbers was seen and only 1 patient experienced an increase in platelet count. Toxicity mainly consisted of mild local phlebitis at the site of infusion and sternal pain after bolus injection.
