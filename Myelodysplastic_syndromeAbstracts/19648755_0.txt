 OBJECTIVE: Study of the disease patterns and clinical evaluation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 85 patients, with MDS who were followed up over a period of 23 years at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan. Cases were analyzed according to the French, American and British Classification. RESULTS: Of the 85 patients, 42 (49.4%) were females and 43 (50%) males; mean age was 59 +/- 19 years (range 18-88). Most subtypes found in patients were refractory anemia (RA) in 27 (31.8%) and RA with excess blasts (RAEB) in 28 (32.9%). Adverse prognostic indicators were RAEB subtype and requirement for blood transfusion. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that MDSs appeared at a younger age and tended to be of the aggressive subtype. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia subtype seemed to appear dominantly in men.
