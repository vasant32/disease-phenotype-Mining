We measured the levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and immunosuppressive acid protein (IAP) in 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 8 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 7 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 5 with malignant lymphoma (ML), 3 with multiple myeloma (MM) and one with adult T cell leukemia. On admission, the level of IAP was abnormally high in all cases of AML and ALL 50% of CML cases, 71.4% of MDS cases, 60% of ML cases and none of MM cases. ADA was elevated in all cases of ALL, 77.8% of AML and CML cases, 57.1% of MDS cases, 60% of ML cases and 33.3% of MM cases. In 7 patients with AML, the level of IAP returned to normal when they achieved complete remission. On the other hand, the level of ADA had already returned to normal even during induction therapy. ADA showed a positive correlation with the absolute number of peripheral blasts and lactic dehydrogenase both in AML and ALL. These results suggest that ADA indicates the activity of leukemia and IAP indicates the immunocompetence of the host.
