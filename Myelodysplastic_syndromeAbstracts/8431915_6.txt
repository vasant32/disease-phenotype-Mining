We report the clonal chromosome abnormalities of five patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). In one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), an abnormal clone was present in the bone marrow (BM): 47,XY,trp(1)(q32q44), + mar. Two had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), one with monosomy 7 and the other with 46,XY,add(1)(p34),del(7)(p13). In the two others without signs of MDS or AML, pseudodiploidy with 46,XX,-5, +8 and 46,XX, +5, -21 were present, respectively. The significance of these abnormalities is discussed.
