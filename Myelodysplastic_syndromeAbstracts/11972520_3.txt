A novel human leukaemia cell line, designated TMD7, was established from blast cells of a patient with de novo acute myeloblastic leukaemia with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TLD). As seen in the original blast cells, TMD7 cells expressed CD7, CD13, CD33 and CD34 and showed an abnormal karyotype containing -5, -7, -8, der(16)t(10;16)(q22;q13). The cells proliferated without added growth factors. Growth was stimulated with the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and interleukin 3. Differentiation was not observed with the addition of various cytokines. As a cell line derived from AML/TLD has not been reported, TMD7 will be a useful tool as a model of AML/TLD cells. Recently, it was reported that the Notch system has crucial roles to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells. We found that TMD7 cells expressed Notch-1 and Notch-2 mRNA. The exposure to recombinant Delta-1 protein, which was one of the Notch ligands, significantly stimulated the growth of TMD7 cells. This is the first human cell line which was shown to proliferate in response to Delta-1, without artificially expressed Notch protein. Therefore, TMD7 will also be a useful tool to study the mechanism of the Notch-Notch ligand interaction.
