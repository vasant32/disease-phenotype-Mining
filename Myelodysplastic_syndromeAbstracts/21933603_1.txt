Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has three decades history in China. During these periods, the number of HSCT has been increasing, donor and stem cell sources were expanded, indication of diseases and patients for HSCT extended. Forty-two HSCT units offered their data 1–6 times from July 2007 to June 2010. The annual increase rates were 8.8% to 10.8%. Matched sibling donor is 41%, mismatched related/haploidentical donor is 24%, unrelated volunteer donor is 16%, and umbilical cord blood is 2%. The indications of major disease entities are acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 35%), acute lymphobastic leukemia (ALL, 25%), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, 21%), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 8%). The different opinions on the indication of HSCT were supported by some trials, matched/haploidentical HSCT fit for middle or high risk ALL and AML in first complete remission (CR1), the international prognosis score system (IPSS) — middle-II/high risk MDS, CML in advanced stage and so on, when patients have no matched sibling donor. In the Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, haploidentical HSCT has received a comparable result to matched simbling donor HSCT and unrelated matched donor HSCT; we suggest haploidentical donor might be a routine alternative donor for high-risk patents who need an urgent HSCT without matched related donor in special center.
