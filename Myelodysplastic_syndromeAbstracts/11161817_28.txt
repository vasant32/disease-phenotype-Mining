Loss of a whole chromosome 5, or a del(5q), are recurring abnormalities in malignant myeloid diseases. In previous studies, we defined a commonly deleted segment (CDS) of 1.5 Mb between D5S479 and D5S500 in patients with a del(5q), and we established a P1 artificial chromosome-based contig encompassing this interval. To identify candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), we developed a transcript map of the CDS. The map contains 18 genes and 12 expressed sequence tags/UniGenes. Among the 18 genes are 10 genes that were previously cloned and 8 novel genes. The newly identified genes include CDC23, which encodes a component of the anaphase-promoting complex; RAB6KIFL, which encodes a kinesin-like protein involved in organelle transport; and KLHL3, which encodes a human homologue of the Drosophila ring canal protein, kelch. We determined the intron/exon organization of 14 genes and eliminated each gene as a classical TSG by mutation analysis. In addition, we established a single-nucleotide polymorphism map as well as a map of the mouse genome that is syntenic to the CDS of human 5q31. The development of a transcription map will facilitate the molecular cloning of a myeloid leukemia suppressor gene on 5q.
