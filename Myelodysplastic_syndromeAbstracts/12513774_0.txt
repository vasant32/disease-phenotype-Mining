In order to investigate the clinical characteristics of hematological abnormality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inquire into the basis for differential diagnosis, the hematological data of 92 cases with lupus erythematosus-related hematological disorder (SLERHD) were retrospectively analyzed by use of SPSS/PC software. The results showed that these patients were short of specificity in clinical manifestation and hemogram, however, all cases possessed multiple SLE-related autoantibodies, increase of serum globulin level and varying extent dermal and arthral signs. The incidence of primary or initial symptom in the 92 cases was as follow: 65 anemia (72.8%), 39 purpura (42.4%), 17 hemolytic anemia (18.5%), 56 leukopenia (60.9%), 54 thrombocytopenia (58.7%), and 41 pancytopenia (44.6%). The bone marrow examinations showed that the cellularity of nucleated cells was mostly normal, and active proliferation in 57 cases (61.9%) and hypercellularity in 35 cases (38.1%); the G/E ratio was normal in majority, and G/E ratio > 3 in 59 cases (64.1%) and < 3 in 33 cases (35.9%) and G/E < 1 in 17 cases with hemolytic anemia Coombs' test positive; megakaryocyte counts were normal in 11 cases (11.9%), increase in 80 cases (86.9%) and lower than 7/marrow smear in 1 case (1.1%). Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase staining was negative in all of the cases. From above data it is concluded that patients with SLERHD are varied in clinical and blood pictures, but all patients are provided with multiple SLE-related autoantibodies, globulinemia and dermal and arthral signs. It is easy to identify SLERHD from aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Evans' syndrome by comprehensive and detailed clinical and laboratory examinations.
