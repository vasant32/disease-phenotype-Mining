Eighteen patients in a high-blast group of myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with low-dose SM-108 (4-carbamoylimidazolium 5-olate). Seven of the 18 patients (38.9%) achieved a partial response, and 4 (22.2%) achieved complete response. Treatment was associated with significant, but transient myelotoxicity. Changes in CFU-GEMM clonal growth were examined in bone marrow from patients during the treatment.
