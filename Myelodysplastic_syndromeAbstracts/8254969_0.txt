80-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of pancytopenia. Her peripheral and bone marrow examinations were performed. According to the criteria of FAB classification, the diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation). Etoposide was administered to decrease leukemic blasts. However, she still had high fever and increasing of CRP. Hematological data also showed the increasing of WBC count, blast cells, and LDH enzyme. Antibiotics and anti fungal drugs were also not effective. She died of respiratory failure, although the cautions and extensive treatment was tried. Autopsy findings revealed proliferation of mucor in the mucosa of stomach. So, we reported here a very rare case of gastric mucormycosis, localizing exclusively in the stomach which was difficult to diagnose while she was alive.
