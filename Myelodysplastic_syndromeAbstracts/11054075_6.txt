The clonality of peripheral blood cells was assessed in eight female patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by means of the human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA). The patients were in complete remission for a median follow-up time of 83 months after intensive chemotherapy. X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) indicated polyclonal haemopoiesis in five patients. Two patients had skewed lyonization (i.e. unbalanced XCIPs in both granulocytes and T cells) and one patient presented monoclonal granulocytes together with polyclonal T cells. We conclude that long-term remission in MDS following intensive chemotherapy is usually associated with polyclonal haemopoiesis.
