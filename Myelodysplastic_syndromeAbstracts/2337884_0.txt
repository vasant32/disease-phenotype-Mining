Expression of three clones (6-1E, 7-3G and 9-5C) selected from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia cDNA library was studied by nucleic acid hybridization in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) treated with chemical inducers of cell differentiation and in primary cells derived from 27 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells upon induction by 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was accompanied by rapid induction of the expression of 6-1E and 7-3G genes. The levels of expression of the 9-5C gene were not altered during macrophage-monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. The expression of the 6-1E and/or 7-3G gene was induced by TPA in four of 6 samples derived from patients who achieved complete remission, but not in any of the acute nonlymphocytic leukemia samples from patients who failed to achieve complete remission. These findings suggest that expression of the 6-1E and 7-3G genes is related to macrophage-monocytic differentiation and that alterations of these gene expressions in fresh leukemia cells after one hour of TPA treatment are of prognostic significance in predicting the response to therapy.
