A 36-year-old, previously healthy woman was referred to our institution with pancytopenia and splenomegaly for suspected acute leukemia. Bone marrow aspiration showed marked dysplastic changes, excess of blasts, and only spurious red blood cell precursors. Action was taken to prepare allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling for myelodysplastic syndrome. Repeat cytological examination of the bone marrow revealed striking hyperplasia of the red cell line with presence of abnormal giant proerythroblasts. Acute parvovirus B19 infection was suspected and confirmed by detection of anti-B19 IgM and B19 DNA. The underlying disease for this transient aplastic crisis was a formerly unknown hereditary spherocytosis.
