We present a 65-year-old female with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who has attended our O.P.D. since 1983. In early December, 1990, dyspnea on effort developed which then progressed to dyspnea at rest at the end of December. She was admitted on January 8 with orthopnea. Chest X-ray films revealed loss of vascular shadows of the right lung. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia and hypocapnemia. Abnormalities in the coagulation-fibrinolytic system (increased TAT (thrombin-anti-thrombin III complex) and alpha 2-PIC (plasmin inhibitor complex)), possibly due to MDS, were detected. The diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism was made by pulmonary perfusion scintigram and pulmonary arteriography. After commencement of anticoagulation therapy on January 15, the subjective symptoms, blood gas analysis, pulmonary scintigram, and disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system improved. The patient was discharged on March 5, 1991. The present case of myelodysplastic syndrome was associated with abnormalities of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system and was complicated by pulmonary thromboembolism.
