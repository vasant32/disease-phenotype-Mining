The study was aimed to investigate the expression of stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1) in bone marrow (BM) and its relation with apoptosis of BM CD34(+) cell and angiogenesis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 40 patients with MDS were divided into low-risk group and high-risk group according to IPSS score system. BM samples were collected. SDF-1 levels, the apoptosis of CD34(+) cells and microvessel density (MVD) of BM were detected by ELISA, flow cytometry and immunochemistry, respectively. The results showed that the SDF-1 level in MDS patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls(p < 0.05), and SDF-1 level in low-risk group was significantly higher than that in high-risk group. Apoptosis of CD34(+) cells significantly increased in low-risk group compared with other groups (p < 0.05). MVD in BM biopsy significantly increased in high-risk MDS group (p < 0.05), compared with low-risk MDS group which also had higher MVD than the control group (p < 0.05). Positive correlation was found between apoptosis of CD34(+) cells and SDF-1 levels in low-risk group, and SDF-1 level and MVD in high-risk group. It is concluded that the expression of SDF-1, apoptosis of BM CD34(+) cells and MVD were significantly abnormal in MDS patients, especially in different risk group, suggesting that SDF-1 level is related to cell apoptosis and angiogenesis.
