 PURPOSE/METHODS: We studied a rare initial manifestation of myelodysplastic syndrome in an 82-year-old woman who had acute secondary glaucoma in the right eye and mature cataracts in both eyes. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Therapy with glaucoma control medications and cataract extraction in the right eye resulted in expulsive hemorrhage and subsequent enucleation of the right eye. After cataract extraction, examination of the left eye disclosed a central serous retinal detachment and hemorrhage. Histopathologic analysis of the right eye demonstrated myelocytic and lymphocytic infiltration.
