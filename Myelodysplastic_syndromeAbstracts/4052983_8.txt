Thirteen patients with a hematologic disorder and an interstitial deletion of part of a chromosome #13 were evaluated to determine if any specific clinical manifestations are associated with these cytogenetic anomalies. Our results suggest that these anomalies occur in approximately 1.7% of patients with a chromosomally abnormal clone and a hematologic disorder. They may occur as the sole chromosome anomaly (8 of our patients) or with other abnormalities (5 of our patients). The breakpoints are not always the same, but band 13q14 always seems to be lost. At the time of chromosome analysis, 5 patients had a history of myelofibrosis or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, 2 had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, 2 had a myelodysplastic syndrome, one had polycythemia vera, one had sideroblastic anemia, one had acute lymphocytic leukemia, and one had an undifferentiated myeloproliferative disorder.
