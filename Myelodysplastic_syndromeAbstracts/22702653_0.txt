BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone) escalated is the preferred upfront Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment in a number of countries. Upon failure, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDT/ASCT) is performed, but its effectiveness has not been verified in this setting. We analyzed all Swiss cases of chemosensitive HL autografted after failure of BEACOPP escalated (n = 22) and compared outcomes with 22 cases of HDT/ASCT following frontline ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) failure. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 76% for ABVD and 42% for BEACOPP escalated (p = 0.029). Two- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 90% and 71% for ABVD and 72% and 65% for BEACOPP escalated, respectively (p = not significant). Three patients in the ABVD and four in the BEACOPP escalated groups underwent allotransplant for relapse after HDT/ASCT. Grade 3-4 toxicities were comparable in both groups. Three cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) were recorded in the BEACOPP escalated group. The acceptable PFS and OS of chemosensitive patients with HL autografted after failure of upfront BEACOPP escalated seem to justify this approach.
