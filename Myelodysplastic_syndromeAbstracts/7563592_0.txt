Thirteen cases, including 10 relapse cases, of refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (aged 17-70, median 46) by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) simultaneously to enhance the sensitivity to Ara-C. Low dose Ara-C (10-40 mg/day) combined with G-CSF was administered in most of them. Complete (CR) and partial remission (PR) were achieved in 5 and 4 patients, respectively, and response (CR + PR) rate was 69.2%. We obtained 5 CRs and 3 PRs in 10 patients with relapsed AML. However, CR and PR duration was short in all cases. None of the 3 patients with MO, AML transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and de novo AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS) had any response. There was no leukemic colony formation in the culture medium containing G-CSF in the nonresponding patients. The combination therapy caused severe myelosuppression, and most patients experienced prolonged neutropenia, and suffered from infections. In some patients enhanced chemosensitivity of leukemic cells induced by G-CSF was indicated but, the effect of this approach must be determined by large scale controlled studies.
