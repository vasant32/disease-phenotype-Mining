The association between autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AHA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was found in seven out of 156 patients with SMD who received several transfusions as supportive therapy. Three patients were diagnosed of refractory anaemia (RA), three more of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and one of refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). All patients showed a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and the presence of anti-red blood cell IgG type antibodies, both in serum and eluate. Clinically, three patients showed signs of low grade haemolysis. It is suggested that in the reported patients, who seem to be immunologically predisposed, red blood cell transfusions could trigger the autoantibodies and the AHA development.
