The plasma soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) level and its relationships with haematologic and immunologic data were examined in 40 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The plasma sIL-2R level was significantly higher in the high-risk MDS group (refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia) than in the low-risk MDS group (refractory anaemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts) or in normal subjects, although there was considerable variation in the plasma sIL-2R level within each MDS group. The plasma sIL-2R level correlated positively with the bone marrow cellularity and bone marrow blast mass, but not with the absolute number of CD25+ lymphocytes. This may support the idea that plasma sIL-2R is derived from malignant MDS cells in the bone marrow. The plasma sIL-2R level correlated negatively with the absolute numbers of the CD8+, CD3-CD16+, and CD3-CD56+ cell populations in freshly isolated lymphocytes, the percentage of CD3-CD56+ cells in lymphokine (interleukin 2)-activated killer (LAK) cells, and the cytotoxicity of LAK cells. We conclude that MDS patients having a high plasma sIL-2R level often have a defect in natural killer and CD8+ T-cells.
