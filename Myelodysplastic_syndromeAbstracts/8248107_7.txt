p53 overexpression was studied immunohistochemically in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies using a recently described technique for antigen retrieval based on microwave oven heating of paraffin sections. Using a monoclonal antibody (PAb1801) that reacts with human cellular p53, nuclear staining was detected in 7/11 (63%) therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and in 3/4 (75%) therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias. Conversely, staining for p53 was seen only in 9/40 (22%) cases of "primary" hematologic conditions (P < 0.007); these included myelodysplastic syndromes [#2], acute myeloid leukemia [#4], and chronic granulocytic leukemia in accelerated phase or blast crisis [#3]. Biopsies of normal controls and of chronic granulocytic leukemia in stable phase were consistently p53(-). Nine of the 10 karyotyped p53(+) acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome cases showed complex cytogenetic findings with frequent involvement of chromosome 5 and/or 7. Only four of the 33 karyotyped p53(-) cases showed similar cytogenetic changes. Chromosome 17 involvement was present in four of 13 (31%) cytogenetically assessed p53+ cases, but in none of the p53(-). In univariate analysis, p53 expression in both MDS and AML was significantly associated with shorter survival. The frequent overexpression of p53 in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias and in accelerated phase/blast crisis, chronic granulocytic leukemia and its strong association with complex karyotypes suggests an important role of this gene in the pathogenesis of these leukemic conditions.
