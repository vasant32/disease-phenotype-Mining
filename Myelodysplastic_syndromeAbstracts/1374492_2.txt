We examined the feasibility of maintaining specific plasma concentrations of ara-C and VP-16 in children with AML. Sixty-one children were treated with 6 sequential cycles of intensive chemotherapy consisting of: (1) cytarabine (ara-C)/VP-16, (2) ara-C/daunorubicin (Dauno), (3) VP-16/amsacrine (m-AMSA), (4) VP-16/5-azacytidine (5-Az), (5) ara-C/Dauno, and (6) ara-C/VP-16. Fifty-nine children had de novo AML, and 2 had a previous myelodysplastic syndrome. The number of patients with each specific FAB subtype was: M0-1; M1-7; M2-24; M3-7; M4-5; M5-11; and M7-6. Simultaneous continuous infusions of ara-C and VP-16 (cycle 1) given at individualized doses to achieve drug plasma concentrations of 1 microM and 30 microM, respectively, produced complete remission (CR) in 26 of 61 patients (43%); an additional 17 patients entered CR after Dauno/ara-C (cycle 2), and one patient required 4 cycles of chemotherapy to achieve CR (total CR rate = 72%). The preliminary 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for patients with FAB-M1 and -M2 AML was only 15% versus 40% for those with FAB-M4 and -M5 AML. Overall, 21 of the 61 patients remain in CR (2-yr EFS = 29%). We conclude that intense treatment with ara-C and VP-16 at doses individualized to achieve target plasma concentrations is feasible although severely myelosuppressive. It results in an acceptable CR rate, but does not improve EFS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
