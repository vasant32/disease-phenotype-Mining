 AIM: Clinical outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients still remain unsatisfactory and the optimal treatment has yet to be clearly established. This report describes the results of a retrospective study of clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of AML in patients aged 75 years and older. In addition, we aimed to elucidate the situation of patients with AML accompanied by dementia, which has been largely ignored in previous studies. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 31 patients with untreated AML (including previous myelodysplastic syndrome: AML/MDS). All patients underwent chemotherapy, with 25 undergoing conventional therapy and six undergoing low-intensity therapy. RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 16 of the 31 cases (51.6%), with a 3-year survival rate of 11.5%. However, in seven cases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) was observed. Although we were able to perform induction therapy in each of these cases, consolidation therapy was difficult in cases of moderate AD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that even very elderly patients can benefit from chemotherapy. However, it is thought that the treatment selection for cases which are complicated by moderate to severe dementia should be determined carefully while considering the patient's quality of life.
