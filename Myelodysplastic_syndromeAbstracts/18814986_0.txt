This study investigated the feasibility of an MRI protocol providing whole-body T2* maps at 1.5 T. Seven healthy volunteers (mean age=30.1+/-3.7, three women and four men) and two patients (both male, 53 and 46 years old) affected by transfusion-dependent anemias participated in the study. Coronally oriented images of five subsequent body levels were acquired using a fat-suppressed multiecho 2D gradient-echo sequence (12 echo times ranging from 4.8 to 76.3 ms were selected) and afterwards composed. Parametrical T2* maps of the whole body were reconstructed on a pixel-by-pixel basis. For both, healthy volunteers and patients, representative T2* values were computed from extended regions of interest (ROIs). Good-quality whole-body T2* maps were computed in all volunteers and patients. In healthy volunteers, T2* values were assessed in the cerebral white (58.5+/-4.2 ms) and gray (81.4+/-5.5 ms) matter, liver (34.3+/-7.0 ms), spleen (63.5+/-3.3 ms), kidneys (65.4+/-10.3 ms) and skeletal muscles (~30 ms). The liver presented faster relaxation rates in males as compared to females. One patient (serum ferritin concentration=927 microg/dl) showed shortened T2* values in liver (3.6+/-5.5 ms), spleen (3.1+/-4.8 ms), kidneys (11.1+/-7.1 ms) and muscles (25.1+/-3.4 ms). The second patient (serum ferritin concentration=346 microg/dl) presented reduced T2* values in liver (3.9+/-7.3 ms), spleen (20.1+/-9.8 ms) and kidneys (24.6+/-7.7 ms). The presented technique may find clinical application in the assessment of the iron burden in the entire body, and in monitoring of chelation therapies in patients treated with frequent blood transfusions.
