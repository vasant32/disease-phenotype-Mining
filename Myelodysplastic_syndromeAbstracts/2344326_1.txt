Previous reports have noted an association between Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) and leukaemia, and less commonly other haematological abnormalities. We report a previously unrecognised association between Sweet's syndrome (SS) and sideroblastic anaemia (myelodysplastic syndrome--refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts). Both patients were males and one had prominent extracutaneous features of SS. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies were normal in this latter patient and neither patient showed progression to leukaemia.
