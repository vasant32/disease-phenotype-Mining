In 2008, the WHO proposed changes in the classification of MDS regarding RCUD and MDS unclassifiable. We validated these proposals by using 2032 patients of the DÃ¼sseldorf MDS Registry. 10% of the patients had RCUD and 6% MDS-U. Among patients with RCUD, only 9% had RN and 6% had RT. There was no correlation between dysplastic cell line and type of cytopenia. There was no difference in prognosis between RCMD and MDS-U and between RA, RT, and RN. The separation of RA, RN, and RT is not justified suggesting a consolidation as RCUD. MDS-U should be integrated into RCMD.
