In patients with normal immunity, cat scratch disease typically develop a papule at the portal of entry and no other cutaneous features. A 73 year old male patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome developed generalized petechial, papular and, vasculitic skin lesions in association with cat scratch disease. After the diagnosis was established by identifying the causative organism in a lymph node biopsy, the patient was treated with erythromycin for three weeks resulting in progressive clearance of the skin lesions. Apart from the soluble IL-2 receptor, no other serologic inflammatory parameters were elevated. IgG antibodies against Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana increased only slightly during acute exacerbation of the disease, but significantly increased some months later. The diagnosis was established by the positive staining of the lymph node biopsy using the Warthin-Starry stain.
