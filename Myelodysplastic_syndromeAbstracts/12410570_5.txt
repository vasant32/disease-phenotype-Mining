Thrombocytopenia is a poor prognostic indicator in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Treatment options for patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia are limited. Danazol, an attenuated androgen, may have some efficacy in increasing the platelet count of patients with MDS. We retrospectively reviewed 33 patients with primary MDS who were treated with danazol for 6 or more weeks. After 6 weeks on danazol, the mean platelet count increased from 42 x 10(9)/L to 60 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.015), and 25 out of 33 patients (76%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the mean platelet count increased to 67 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.005), and 21 out of 29 patients (72%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Seven out of nine patients no longer required platelet transfusions because bleeding stopped after 6 weeks on danazol. Mean duration of response was 10 months (range 2-68 months). Responses were seen in all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and in all International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores. Therapy was well tolerated. Danazol may be effective in MDS patients who are thrombocytopenic.
