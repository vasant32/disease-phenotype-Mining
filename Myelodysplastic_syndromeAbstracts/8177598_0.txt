Gastrointestinal bleeding is often fatal in elderly. The danger could be multiplied by thrombocytopenia or by other disorder of the coagulation system. In a thrombocytopenic patient with myelodysplastic syndrome life threatening gastrointestinal bleeding occurred which could not be controlled by conventional methods (cimetidine, antacids, aminocaproic acid, platelet transfusions, blood transfusion 400-1200 ml/day). Continuous i.v. infusion of somatostatin [250 micrograms/hour Stilamin (Serono)] and per os omeprazole [2 x 1 capsule Losec (Astra)] resulted in the cessation of bleeding in 24 hours. Adverse effect was not observed.
