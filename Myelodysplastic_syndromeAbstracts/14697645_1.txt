A transformation of essential thrombocythemia to acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, or agnogenic myelocytic metaplasia is a relatively rare event. It occurs in 1%-4.5% of all patients with either treated or untreated essential thrombocythemia. Cytogenetic changes in the transformation to AML are common. We report the case of a patient treated for essential thrombocythemia with hydroxyurea for 49 months. He developed AML with a t(2;17), which to our knowledge has not been described in the literature.
