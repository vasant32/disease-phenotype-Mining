We describe a case of Plasmodium falciparum infection in a 25-year-old male patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in September 2003. Conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation (10 Gy) and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg for 2 days. A dose of 4 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was transfused. Engraftment was well documented on day 17 post-transplantation. Spiking fevers occurred on days 19 and 21, associated with a pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and neurological signs. P. falciparum parasites were found on the peripheral blood smear (parasitemia = 23%). Marrow aspiration showed P. falciparum parasites and proliferation of mature histiocytes with hemophagocytosis. Quinine 10 mg/kg i.v. three times a day for 10 consecutive days was given. The fever subsided within 3 days, and pancytopenia vanished in 14 days. Parasitemia cleared in 6 days. The patient left the unit on day 46 with no further complications. The screening of donors showed that infection was acquired from two blood units (from a single donor) given 5 days before transplantation. We report the first case of profound hemophagocytosis in immunosuppressed patient with malaria of high parasitemia after a bone marrow transplant.
