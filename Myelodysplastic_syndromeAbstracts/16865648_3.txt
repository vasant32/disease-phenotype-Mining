The intravascular variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (IVBL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is frequently diagnosed at autopsy because the symptoms are nonspecific or confusing. We report a case of IVBL in a woman with pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome manifested as a fever of unknown origin, bilateral adrenal enlargement and subsequent development of panhypopituitarism. Lymphomatous infiltration or osteomyelitis of the sella was supposed. Despite antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy the patient died within three months. An intravascular variant of B-cell lymphoma with intravascular collections of lymphomatous cells predominantly localized in the adrenal and pituitary glands was found at autopsy. The association of panhypopituitarism with bilateral adrenal enlargement is uncommon in endocrinological praxis and the occurrence of combined endocrine involvement in a patient with IVBL has not been described in previous literature.
