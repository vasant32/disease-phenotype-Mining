ST segment elevation is one of the most important electrocardiographic features that need to be recognised. Although ST segment elevation myocardial infarction is one of the main causes of this abnormality, there are other non-ischaemic causes that are also important. We discuss reversible apical ballooning syndrome or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, pericarditis and a case of ST segment elevation due to 'early repolarisation pattern'.
