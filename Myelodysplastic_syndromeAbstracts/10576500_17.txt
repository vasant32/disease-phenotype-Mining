We examined polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes in 159 Japanese patients with myelodysplasia and compared the incidence with that in 43 normal individuals to clarify their pathogenetic significance in myelodysplasia. In individuals with the GSTT1 null genotype, the odds ratios for disease risk were elevated to 2.65 (95%CI; 1.27-5.52) in de novo MDS, 4.62 (1.48-14.4) in therapy-related AML, and 2.94 (1.07-8.07) in AML with triliniage dysplasia. Other representative polymorphisms of GSTs had a similar incidence among patients with myelodysplasia, and those of the controls and other hematological disorders. To further investigate the genetic pathway of myelodysplasia, the association between GST genotype and karyotype or configurations of TP53 and NRAS was evaluated, but no relationship was noted. These results suggest that the GSTT1 null genotype may play a role in an increased risk of myelodysplasia unrelated to other mechanisms of myelodysplasia, such as chromosomal alterations or mutation of TP53 or NRAS.
