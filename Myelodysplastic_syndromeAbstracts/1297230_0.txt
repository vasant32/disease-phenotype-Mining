Red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA-RBC) activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is significantly increased compared to that observed in normal controls. ADA-RBC activity is not related to fetal hemoglobin concentration, but it is significantly correlated with hemoglobin concentration at diagnosis and with the degree of morphologic dysplasia in the erythroid lineage. The results of our study suggest that the observed enzymatic abnormality may constitute a non-specific manifestation of the stem cell alteration that determines these disorders.
