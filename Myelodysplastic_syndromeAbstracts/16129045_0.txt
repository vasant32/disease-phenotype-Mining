To investigate the mechanisms of the telomerase regulations during the apoptosis of the human MDS-RAEB cell line MUTZ-1 cells induced by arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), telomerase activity was detected by TRAP-ELISA and the expressions of mRNAs of hTERT, TRF1 (TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1), TRF2 (TTAGGG repeat binding factor 2), bcl-2, and bax genes were detected by RT-PCR. Apoptosis was detected by translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) by flow cytometry. The results showed that 1 - 8 micromol/L of As(2)O(3) induced typical apoptosis of MUIZ-1 cells in the dose-and time-dependent manners, the telomerase activity could be down-regulated at this concentration and negatively correlated with increased apoptosis (r = -0.938, P = 0.018). The expression of telomerase activity was positively related to the expression of hTERT (r = 0.783, P = 0.022), but As(2)O(3) had no effect on the mRNA expression of TRF1 and TRF2 genes. The inhibition of telomerase activity by As(2)O(3) on MUTZ-1 cells was accompanied with the low expression of bcl-2 gene and the decrease of bcl-2/bax ratio. It is concluded that the apoptosis of MUTZ-1cells induced by As(2)O(3) may occur via the inhibition of telomerase activity and down-regulation of the expression of hTERT mRNA, and this may be one of the mechanisms inducing apoptosis in MUTZ-1 cells treated by As(2)O(3).
