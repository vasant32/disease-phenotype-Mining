Thirty-four patients with a probable clinical diagnosis of dysmyelopoietic syndrome (DMPS) were studied to assess the in vitro growth pattern of their hemopoietic progenitors, i.e. burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit myeloid (CFU-C) progenitor cells. Twenty-one patients had DMPS confirmed by final diagnosis and were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) recommendations. Our results indicate that the normal colony growth of hemopoietic progenitors in vitro excludes DMPS and other preleukemic conditions. In addition, within the DMPS group a low number of CFU-C (11 colonies or fewer) was a highly significant indicator for the development of acute leukemia. Analysis of the limited number of cytogenetic results in the DMPS patients did not reach statistical significance in relation to the development of acute leukemia.
