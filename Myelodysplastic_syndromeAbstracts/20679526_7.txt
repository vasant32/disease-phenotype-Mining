The role of circulating cytokines and chemokines (C&Ckine) in activating signal transduction in leukemic cells is incompletely defined. We hypothesized that comprehensive profiling of C&Ckine expression in leukemia would provide greater insight compared with individual analyses. We used multiplex array technology to simultaneously measure the level of 27 C&Ckines in serum from 176 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 114 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and 19 normal controls. C&Ckine levels in AML and MDS differed significantly from normal controls (5 higher, 13 lower) but were similar to each other for 24 of 27 analytes, with interleukin-8 and interleukin-13 higher in AML and vascular endothelial growth factor A higher in MDS. Levels did not correlate with age, gender, infection, or blood counts; however, 3 correlated with specific cytognetic abnormalities in AML. Individually, few cytokines had any correlation with response or survival. In newly diagnosed AML, 8 C&Ckine signatures, distinct from the normal control signature, were observed. These signatures had prognostic impact, affecting remission, primary resistance, relapse rates, and overall survival, individually (P = .003) and in multivariable analysis (P = .004). These patterns suggest specific therapeutic interventions to investigate in subsets of AML patients. In conclusion, C&Ckine expression in AML and MDS differs from normal, is similar with one another, and forms recurrent patterns of expression with prognostic relevance.
