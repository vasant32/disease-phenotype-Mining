 BACKGROUND: Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter region of the perforin gene (PRF1) and it was found that the -398T mutant allele is correlated with lower amounts of protein in circulating CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the -398C/T polymorphism in the perforin gene in oncohematological patients. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with hematological malignancies treated at the teaching hospital of the Universidade Federal do Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro were invited to participate in this study. The identification of the polymorphism was achieved by amplification using polymerase chain reaction, digestion using the TaqI enzyme and electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. RESULTS: The heterozygous -398C/T polymorphism was identified in 16.7% patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 40% with multiple myeloma, 50% with essential thrombocythemia, 14.3% with Hodgkin's disease, 7.7% with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 33.3% with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The homozygous mutant allele was identified in one mulatto individual (25%) with myelodysplastic syndrome. When Afro-Brazilian and Whites were analyzed together, there was a higher frequency of the -398T allele in patients than in healthy individuals (p-value = 0.0291). CONCLUSION: ne patient was homozygous for the -398T allele. Based on these findings, further studies should be conducted to assess whether the presence of this polymorphism may be a risk factor for the development of hematologic malignancies.
