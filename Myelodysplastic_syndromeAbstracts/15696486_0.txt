 OBJECTIVE: To report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) with t(1;18)(p31;p11). METHODS: Chromosome specimens were prepared by short-term culture of bone marrow cells. Karyotype analysis was made by R banding technique. Chromosome painting was performed using whole chromosome probes 1 and 18. RESULTS: Conventional karyotype analysis revealed t(1;18)(p31;p11) in this patient. Chromosome painting analysis confirmed this result. CONCLUSION: The translocation of (1;18) was an unusual recurrent chromosome change and was reported on MDS for the first time.
