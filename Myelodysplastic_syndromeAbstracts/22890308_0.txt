 AIM: This study compared genetic aberrations in hematopoietic cells (HCs) and mesenchymal stem cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-MSCs) patients. METHODS: We obtained chromosomes with aberrations from 22 patients with MDS and chromosomes from 7 healthy individuals. Chromosomal aberrations in both HCs and MSCs were identified using G-banding. We then performed DNA content analysis of the HCs and MSCs. RESULTS: Cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 13 of the 22 MDS patients (59%). Chromosomal aberrations in MSCs were detected in 15 of the 22 MDS patients (68%). No chromosomal abnormalities were identified in MSCs of the 7 healthy volunteers. We demonstrate herein that MSCs have distinct genetic abnormalities compared to HCs from the same individual. We observed a random loss of chromosomal material in significant proportions of MSCs. A high proportion of random loss may be a marker of chromosomal instability of MDS-MSCs. However, two case results showed that HCs and MSCs have different altered structural changes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in MDS patients. Our data indicates that the genetic alterations in MSCs may constitute a particular biological mechanism of MDS pathogenesis.
