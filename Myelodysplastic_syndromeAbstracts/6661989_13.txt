DNA flow cytometric analysis of unfixed bone marrow cells stained with propidium iodide was carried out in 33 patients with untreated primary myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients with stable clinical course for up to 3 years had higher fractions of cells in S and G2 phases (22.7 +/- 12.4% and 12 +/- 3.6%) than those who developed acute leukemia and/or died early in the course of disease (14.4 +/- 8.5% and 6.6 +/- 4%). Median survival was more than 36 mo in patients with S + G2 cell fraction higher than 24%, and 14 mo in the remaining 16 patients with lower values (P less than 0.01). Analyses repeated after 3-24 mo showed no major changes in cell proliferation pattern in ten out of 11 patients. The remaining patient had sharp decrease in S and G2 cell fraction 3 mo before the transition into acute leukemia. The DNA index (DI) of bone marrow cells was calculated to assess ploidy. However, comparative evaluation of cytologic, cytogenetic, and flow cytometric data suggest that, under our experimental conditions, the DI may be influenced by factors such as the degree of chromatin compactness.
