Aspergillus terreus is ubiquitous in the environment but has rarely been found to be pathogenic. When recovered from clinical specimens, it is commonly considered a saprophyte. We report two cases of fatal disseminated A. terreus infection. The first patient was receiving corticosteroid therapy for immune thrombocytopenia when the condition developed, and the second patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy after bone marrow transplantation for myelodysplasia. We also describe the frequency of recovery of A. terreus in our laboratory. The serious pathogenic potential of A. terreus in immunocompromised hosts should be recognized.
