Relevance of immune-dysregulation for emergence, dominance and progression of dysplastic clones in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was suggested, but valuable or predictive criteria on this involvement are lacking. We previously reported that reduced T-regulatory cells (Treg) and high CD54 expression on T cell identify a sub-group of patients in whom an immune-pathogenesis might be inferred. Here, we suggest the occurrence of immune-selection of dysplastic clones in a subgroup of MDS patients, with reduced HLA-I and HLA-E on PMN, and propose that an altered immune profile might represent a valuable criterion to classify Low/Int-1 patients on the basis of immune-pathogenesis of MDS.
