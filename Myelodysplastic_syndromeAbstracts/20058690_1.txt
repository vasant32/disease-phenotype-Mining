A 27-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of a persistent high fever since August 2007. Chest radiography showed infiltration shadows in the right lower lung field. Chest CT revealed scattered small nodular shadows and patchy consolidations in the right lower lobe. He was diagnosed as secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (sPAP) associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), confirmed by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and bone marrow aspiration. Sera were negative for anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibody. He developed a subcutaneous abscess and meningitis caused by M. absessus after VATS. After a long-course of antibiotic therapy, an allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was performed. But he died of graft versus host disease and M. abscessus sepsis 87 days after transplantation.
