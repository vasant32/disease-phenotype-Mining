Two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome in the dog are described. Both cases were characterized by hepatomegaly, cytopenias, macrocytosis, cellular bone marrow, and dysplastic changes in all hematopoietic cell lines. Serum vitamin B12 and folic acid concentrations were within reference ranges in one dog, but vitamin B12 was slightly decreased in the other. Vitamin B12 therapy did not result in amelioration of the hematologic disorder. The duration of illness was approximately 5 months. Necropsy of one dog revealed an acute undifferentiated leukemia.
