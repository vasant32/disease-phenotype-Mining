 PURPOSE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly occur in the elderly but can affect younger individuals too. The latter require special consideration to identify suitable candidates for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, a potentially curative approach carrying a high risk of treatment-related complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the largest series of young MDS patients as yet, including 232 patients younger than 50 years. Their clinical characteristics and prognosis are compared with 2,496 patients older than 50 years. RESULTS: Survival was significantly longer in the younger versus older age group (40 v 23 months, respectively; P < .00005). The difference arose from patients belonging to the low- and intermediate-I-risk categories of the International Prognostic Scoring System (median survival not reached v 45 months, respectively; P < .00005). In contrast, survival was identical for both age groups (8 months for both younger and older patients; P = .81) in the intermediate-II-and high-risk categories. Established classification systems and risk scores were applicable to young patients with primary MDS. Interestingly, a particularly large difference in median survival time was seen between the intermediate-I-and intermediate-II-risk groups (176 v 8 months, respectively). For low-risk patients, the overall survival rate was more than 86% at 20 years. CONCLUSION: According to these results, aggressive treatment approaches should rarely be recommended to younger MDS patients belonging to the low and intermediate-I risk groups.
