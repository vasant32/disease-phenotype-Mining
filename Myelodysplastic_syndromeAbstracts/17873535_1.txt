A 16-year-old female patient presented with complaints of malaise, dizziness, syncope, and nausea of 1-week duration. On dermatologic examination there were telangiectasias, atrophic areas, and poikiloderma with both hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation on the neck and the proximal parts of the thighs. The bone marrow biopsy specimen showed hypocellularity and dysplastic megakaryocytic and erythroid elements, findings consistent with hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome, which was further confirmed by cytogenetic studies. Thereafter, she was referred for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
