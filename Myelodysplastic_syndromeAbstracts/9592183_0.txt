Characteristics of karyotypes were analyzed in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS) at initial diagnosis and compared with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases that had evolved to AML (MDS/AML). Abnormal karyotypes were seen in 11 of 19 patients with AML/TMDS and 13 of 16 MDS/AML cases. Trisomy 8 was observed in 3 AML/TMDS cases as a sole anomaly and was also present in 3 MDS/AML cases but not as a sole finding. Although MDS/AML frequently displayed monosomies or long-arm deletions of chromosome 5, 7 and 9, only one case exhibited long-arm deletion (of chromosome 7) in AML/TMDS. Two or more chromosome aberrations were found in some cases in both groups. These findings suggest that AML/TMDS had passed through several preleukemic stages at diagnosis, as has been well documented in MDS and MDS/AML. Additionally, clonal evolution may have already occurred in AML/TMDS, as MDS transformed to AML is associated with clonal evolution.
