A man with refractory anemia and trisomy 8 complained of repeated febrile episodes. He exhibited oral aphtha, exanthema, genital ulcer, and epididymitis. Laboratory data obtained during febrile episodes revealed leukocytosis with elevated CRP and ESR. Repeated examinations for infectious bacterial agents were negative. HLA analysis detected HLA-B51. Behçet's disease of incomplete type was diagnosed and successfully treated with prednisolone. It was speculated that the repeated febrile episodes may have been a manifestation of neutrophil hyper-function induced by increased blood levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8 and G-CSF, in association with rare complications of Behçet's disease.
