Hematological data and histopathological bone marrow findings were compared in 60 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 40 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and concurrent inflammation, and 39 HIV-negative patients with severe inflammation. Results show that the hematologic, histologic, and morphometric findings in patients with AIDS have a closer resemblance to the findings in patients with severe inflammation than to those in patients with MDS. It is concluded, that the peripheral cytopenia frequently observed in AIDS-patients is rather a consequence of severe inflammation, than of ineffective hematopoiesis.
