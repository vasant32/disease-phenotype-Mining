Prolonged administration of conventional (100 mg/m2/day) or low dose Ara-C (20 mg/m2/day) has been associated with significant clinical antileukemic effects in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes. These doses and schedules of Ara-C yield plasma Ara-C concentrations in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Utilizing concentrations and a schedule of Ara-C treatment, representative of Ara-C exposures in these clinical situations, we performed in vitro studies to examine the effects of co-treatment with pIXY 321 on Ara-C induced apoptosis and Ara-C-mediated colony growth inhibition of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Significantly greater internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, higher percentage of morphologically recognizable apoptotic cells and increased colony growth inhibition were observed following treatment with 100 versus 10 nM Ara-C for 5 days. Simultaneous exposure to 10 ng/ml pIXY 321 resulted in significantly increased colony growth inhibition as well as DNA fragmentation and apoptosis due to 10 nM but not 100 nM Ara-C. These concentrations of Ara-C inhibited c-myc and did not induce c-jun mRNA expression. These effects of Ara-C on c-myc and c-jun expressions were not influenced by co-treatment with pIXY 321. Neither treatment with pIXY 321 or Ara-C alone, nor co-treatment with pIXY 321 and Ara-C, significantly altered the intracellular p26BCL-2 levels in HL-60 cells. These results indicate that co-treatment with pIXY 321 significantly increases low dose Ara-C-induced apoptosis and thereby its antileukemic activity.
