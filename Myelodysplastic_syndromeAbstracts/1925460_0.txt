The endstage in a patient suffering from acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome was characterized by bleedings, anemia, pain in the upper abdomen and ascites. At autopsy the radicles of the portal veins were occluded by leukemic infiltrates and fibrosis. These lesions block the perfusion of the liver presinusoidally and, together with the anemia (hypoalbuminemia), result in ascites resistant to all therapy.
