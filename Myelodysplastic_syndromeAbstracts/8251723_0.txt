The effective rates were 47.83% and 62.96% respectively, the total effective rate being 56%. 6 cases (RAEB 4, RA 1, RAS 1) were treated with all-trans retinoic acid used as an inducer of differentiation, 2 of them were effective. 11 patients with MDS who had transformed into acute leukemia were treated by LD Ara-c and combined TCM-WM chemotherapy, the remission rate was 54.55% and the survival period was 9-27 months after remission.
