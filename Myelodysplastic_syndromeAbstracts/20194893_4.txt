Patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T) are difficult to treat because the cytoreductive treatment might be beneficial for the thrombocytosis component but harmful for the RARS component. As lenalidomide has shown to be efficacious in both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, we have treated 2 RARS-T patients, who were transfusion dependent, with lenalidomide. We report the results of lenalidomide treatment in these patients and show that lenalidomide has clinical activity in this rare disorder. Both patients became transfusion independent, and 1 of the patients attained indeed a complete molecular remission.
