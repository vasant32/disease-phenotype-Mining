A 49-year-old man was hospitalized because of cutaneous plaques and pancytopenia. Hematological findings, and the skin eruption suggested Sweet's syndrome associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess of blasts; RAEB). Treatment for pancytopenia was attempted without effect. Also we tried treatment with antibiotics. The skin lesions healed and the body temperature returned to normal. This case was unusual in the association of myelodysplastic syndrome with Sweet's syndrome.
