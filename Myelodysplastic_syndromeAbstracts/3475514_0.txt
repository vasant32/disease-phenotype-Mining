Cytogenetic analysis from the bone marrow of a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome revealed the balanced translocation t(3;5)(q21;q31). Although this translocation has recently been described in six cases of AML, this is the first such observation in a preleukaemic syndrome. Subsequent evolution into RAEB and AML(M2) was noted without the acquisition of additional cytogenetic changes and complete remission achieved with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The relationships with other acquired abnormalities of chromosomes 3 and 5 in MDS/AML are discussed.
