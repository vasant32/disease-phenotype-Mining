Myelodysplastic syndrome is a preleukemic, clonal disorder of the hematopoetic stem cell. Cutaneous manifestations include infections, vasculitis, neutrophilic dermatoses, and leukemia cutis. Senile purpura is a common condition occurring in elderly individuals who lack other systemic or hematologic diseases. We present a case of myelodysplastic syndrome in which cutaneous lesions resembling senile purpura were the initial clinical manifestation.
