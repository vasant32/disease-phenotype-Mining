This case report concerns a woman thought to have a low blood count myelodysplastic syndrome who responded poorly to cytosine arabinoside. She was treated with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and had an adverse reaction resembling a capillary leak syndrome. Later on, an episode of post-transfusion hemoglobinuria led to the correct diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This case report suggests an adverse effect of GM-CSF on PNH.
