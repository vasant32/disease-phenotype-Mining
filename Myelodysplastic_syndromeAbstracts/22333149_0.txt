 OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: A total of 59 patients with a diagnosis of MDS were divided into low-grade (n = 33) and high-grade (n = 26) groups according to international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). Bone marrow (BM) samples were collected. The SDF-1 and VEGF levels in BM plasma, CXCR4 expression on BM CD34(+) cell and the apoptosis of CD34(+) cells were measured. RESULTS: The SDF-1 levels in MDS patients were significantly higher than those of normal controls [(689 ± 190) ng/L, P < 0.05]. And the low-grade group was significantly higher than that of high-grade group [(2301 ± 413) vs (1173 ± 501) ng/L]. CXCR4 expression on CD34(+) cells were significantly higher in high-grade group (68.1% ± 18.8%) than that of both low-grade (21.0% ± 9.7%) and control groups (19.4% ± 5.3%) (P < 0.05). Apoptotic rate of CD34(+) cells were 54.8% ± 10.2% in low-grade group, 24.3% ± 7.9% in high-grade group and 18.5% ± 8.7% in control group. It significantly increased in low-grade group versus other groups (P < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly higher in MDS patients in low-grade group [(286 ± 97) ng/L] and high-grade group [(407 ± 168) ng/L] versus control group [(157 ± 46) ng/L, P < 0.05]. A positive correlation was found between apoptosis of CD34(+) cells and SDF-1 levels in low-grade group (r = 0.805, P < 0.05), VEGF levels and CXCR4 expression rate in high-grade group (r = 0.683, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of SDF-1/CXCR4 is significantly abnormal in MDS patients. And it is correlated with apoptosis and angiogenesis. Intervention of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may provide a new therapeutic target.
