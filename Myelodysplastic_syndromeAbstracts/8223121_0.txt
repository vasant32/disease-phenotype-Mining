Anemia is a common complication of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Most of these patients often require blood transfusion. 12 patients, including 7 cases of MM and 5 cases of MDS, were treated with rhEPO 10,000 micrograms three times a week for 15 weeks. The hemoglobin in 6 of 7 cases of MM steadily increased and eventually reached normal level without blood transfusion. The number of erythroid precursors in bone marrow was increased significantly and serum ferritin concentration was decreased gradually during EPO administration. However 5 patients with MDS did not show any response to EPO. The adverse side effects were hardly observed in any patients received EPO treatment. It is suggested that rhEPO is a promising preparation for treating MM-associated anemia rather than MDS-associated anemia.
