Four cases with trisomy 11 as the sole chromosomal anomaly are reported, three with de novo acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and one with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after treatment for multiple myeloma. In reviewing the literature, we found 19 additional cases with trisomy 11 as the sole cytogenetic defect. All patients except one were reported to have ANLL or MDS. Thus, it seems that trisomy 11 is another rare but nonrandom chromosomal anomaly in ANLL and MDS. So far, no apparently characteristic clinical or cytologic signs have been found in these cases.
