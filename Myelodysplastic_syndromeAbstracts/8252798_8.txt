Two elderly male patients presented with similar, widespread, papular, granulomatous eruptions and developed myelodysplastic syndromes. The first showed histological features of diffuse granuloma annulare and had mild hypergammaglobulinaemia, slightly abnormal liver function and a leucoerythroblastic anaemia. He developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) secondary to a background myelodysplastic syndrome and was treated with combination chemotherapy during which his eruption settled; his AML and his skin are in remission 1 year later. The second developed a myelodysplastic syndrome and a similar rash with histological features of papular cutaneous sarcoidosis but no systemic abnormalities apart from mild hypergammaglobulinaemia, cutaneous anergy to multiple recall antigens and activation of circulating monocytes. He has remained well but his rash and myelodysplastic syndrome have persisted. These cases are interesting because of the striking similarity of their granulomatous eruptions and their associated haematological abnormalities. Patients with such disseminated, granulomatous cutaneous infiltrations should be investigated to exclude associated haematological abnormalities if there is any abnormality of their peripheral blood picture.
