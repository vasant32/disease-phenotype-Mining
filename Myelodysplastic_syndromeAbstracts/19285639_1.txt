We report the results of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) as first-line therapy mostly in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Between November 2001 and March 2008, 86 patients with cGVHD after allo-HSCT received low-dose MTX therapy until a complete or partial response (CR, PR) was achieved, or until treatment failure or intolerable side effects were found. The median time from HSCT to the start of MTX was 154 (range: 80-993) days. The median number of MTX administrations was 4 (range: 2-18). The overall response rate among all enrolled patients was 83% (71 of 86 patients). The response rate for GVHD involving various organs was 90% (45 of 50) in the skin, 75% (39 of 52) in the liver, 42% (5 of 12) in the mouth, 3 of 7 in the eye, and 2 of 2 in the gut. In addition, MTX treatment allowed for a significant reduction in the prednisone dosage (median 90%) from 20 (2.5-100) mg at the start of MTX administration to 5 (0-30) mg 1 month after MTX was last used. Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant factor related to higher CR rate was sole organ involvement (P = .007). Grade 3 toxicities occurred in only 3 patients presenting cytopenias or oral mucositis. From this analysis, MTX appears to be a well-tolerated, effective, and inexpensive agent when used as a first-line treatment in combination with other immunosuppressive agents for cGVHD, especially for skin or sole organ involvement without concomitant thrombocytopenia.
