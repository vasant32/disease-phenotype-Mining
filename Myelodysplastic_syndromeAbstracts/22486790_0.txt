 BACKGROUND: Recent retrospective studies suggest myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are more common than previously recognized and patients who develop transfusional dependence may be at risk for increased comorbid complications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of Medicare claims focusing on costs associated with patients with a new claim listing ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code 238.7 in first quarter of 2003. Patients were followed until 2005 to assess resource use and costs. RESULTS: A total of 512 patients aged 65 years or more with newly diagnosed MDS were identified. Forty percent had received red blood cell transfusions between 2003 and 2005. During the 3-year follow-up, transfused patients experienced increased prevalence of cardiac diseases, dyspnea, and infections. Cumulative 3-year mean Medicare costs for MDS patients were $49,156. Transfused patients had greater use of hospital inpatient and outpatient services and incurred significantly higher mean costs than nontransfused patients ($88,824 vs. $29,519, p < 0.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and clinical complications, transfusion was independently associated with a 48% increase in monthly costs in addition to the cost of transfusion administration. CONCLUSION: MDS places a significant economic burden on the US Medicare system. MDS patients requiring transfusions experience higher prevalence of new comorbid conditions and incur significantly higher Medicare costs than nontransfused patients during the initial 3 years after diagnosis.
