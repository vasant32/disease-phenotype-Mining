We describe ten cases of aortitis due to Salmonella that were treated at the University of Toronto-affiliated Hospitals between 1978 and 1997. Predisposing conditions included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Main presenting symptoms were fever and abdominal and back pain. The most frequent site involved was the abdominal aorta, followed by the thoracic aorta. All but one patient were treated with intravenous bactericidal antibiotics; seven also underwent surgery, four with axillobifemoral grafts and three with in situ grafts. Four of seven patients died within 1 month of the surgical procedure (three patients with in situ grafts and one patient with axillobifemoral graft). We also reviewed the pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and treatment of 140 cases of aortitis due to Salmonella reported in the literature since 1948. The use of bactericidal antibiotics, together with early surgical intervention and long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy, has led to improved survival.
