Histopathologic diagnosis of the bone marrow in leukemia is usually a supplementary method to the cytological in acute and chronic leukemia. However, for patients with MDS and MPD and with dry tap bone marrow biopsy is very important. Important morphological findings and useful immunohistochemical methods for differentiation and characterization of leukemia are reported and the usefulness of sequential examination of bone marrow in leukemia during and after chemotherapy is emphasized. In addition to leukemia, histological features and differential points of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are mentioned. The proliferating megakaryocytes differed in size and shape between MDS and MPD. The difference in proliferating rate of the cells examined by PCNA was also useful to differentiate the two disorders histologically.
