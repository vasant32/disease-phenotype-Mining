 OBJECTIVE: To probe the expression level of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in malignant clone cells of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHOD: The combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase, APAAP) was used to detect the expression of IGF-IR in the bone marrow cells of 40 MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes. RESULTS: The average IGF-IR expression level on the clone cells \[(84.5 ± 14.2)%\] from the MDS cases was markedly elevated compared to the corresponding level on normal cells \[(11.4 ± 12.1)%\]. And the percentages of malignant clone cells in all 40 MDS cases were significantly correlated with the relevant percentages of IGF-IR positive nucleated cells (r = 0.929, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: IGF-IR might be taken as a marker of clone cells in MDS for its trait to malignant proliferation.
