The outcome of patients diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) between 1990 and 1997 from William Beaumont Hospital (WBH) was analyzed according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk categorization. A retrospective study of 195 MDS patients wa s performed. Seventy-nine patients with MDS, in whom a karyotype was obtained and with an adequate follow-up were included in the final analysis. Cases of proliferative CMML (WBC > 12x10(9)/l) were excluded from the study. The overall median survival was 3.1 years, and median survival stratified by IPSS was 3.4, 4.1 and 0.5 years for the INT-1, INT-2 and high risk group and not yet reached for the low risk group. The overall survival by IPSS subcategorization were 6.88, 5.29, 5.30 and 2.12 years for the low, INT-1, INT-2, and high risk groups respectively. Cytogenetics were significant in predicting the overall survival. The IPSS score stratified patients into risk categories for development of AML. The risk of development into AML was 8, 8, 33 and 54% for the low, INT-1, INT-2 and high risk groups, respectively. We conclude that IPSS score can be useful in predicting survival and AML evolution in some MDS patients.
