Refractory anemia has a relatively low incidence of the subsequent development of acute leukemia and a relatively long survival among the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We observed hematological improvement due to high-dose methylprednisolone in 9 of 18 patients with refractory anemia. The patients' age range was from 28 to 78 years old (mean age: 54), including 14 male and 4 females. A complete response was obtained in 5 patients, minimal response in 4 patients, and no response in 9 patients. Laboratory data of peripheral blood counts and differential counts of bone marrow aspirates were not different, except that fewer chromosomal abnormalities (P = 0.086) were observed in the responder group. Side effects were seen in two patients but were controllable. Overall survival was significantly longer in the responder group (Log-rank P = 0.040, Wilcoxon P = 0.045). The overall survival of responders did not reach the median and 85% of the patients were alive after 180 months, while the median overall survival of the nonresponders was 61.8 months. Disease progression was more frequently seen in the non-responder group (P = 0.045). Furthermore, we investigated retrospectively immunohistochemical bone marrow staining, and a significantly higher percentage of CD68-positive (22.6% +/- 7.1%) and CD45RA-positive cells was observed in the responder group compared to the non-responder group (6.5% +/- 1.3%). Our present results indicate that high-dose methylprednisolone is valuable as a primary treatment before other immunosuppressive treatments, because of its ease of use. High efficacy with high-dose methylprednisolone is expected, especially in patients in which increments in CD68-positive cells in bone marrow are observed.
