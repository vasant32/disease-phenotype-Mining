Serum concentration of erythropoietin (Epo) has been measured by radioimmunoassay in 46 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. There is an overall inverse relationship between the level of Epo and the degree of anaemia but a wide range of Epo response between patients with similar haemoglobin concentrations. No differences were found between the different FAB groups, but the highest Epo levels were found in those patients with erythroid hypoplasia in the bone marrow. It is suggested that the intensity of erythroid activity in the marrow, as well as the degree of anaemia, may be a factor determining serum Epo concentration.
