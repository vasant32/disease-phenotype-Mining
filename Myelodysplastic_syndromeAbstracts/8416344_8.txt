We surveyed the incidence of recognized latex sensitivity in myelodysplasia patients in 16 Shriners Hospitals. The percentage of involved patients ranged from 0 to 22% (mean 5%). Twenty-two children had a significant anaphylactic reaction. We provide recommendations for preoperative prophylaxis and sources of listings of latex and latex-free hospital products and home products.
