Bloom syndrome (BS) predisposes affected individuals to a wide variety of neoplasms including hematological malignancies. Thus far, cytogenetic findings in hematological neoplasms have been reported in only a few BS patients. We present the karyotypic findings in a BS patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FAB subtype M1, and a review of the literature, showing the preferential occurrence of total or partial loss of chromosome 7 in BS patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
