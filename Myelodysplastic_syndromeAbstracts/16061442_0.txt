We report the case of a 8-year-old girl diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. This case was morphologically characterized by the presence of bundle of Auer rods in the neutrophils. The evolution of the disease was marked by a quick transformation in a acute myeloid leukaemia with t(8;21) refractory to treatment. We reviewed the literature for clinical, biological and therapeutic features of this rare childhood hemopathy.
