The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and risks of T-cell depletion in prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD) using HLA haploidentical family donors as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in children with hematological malignancies without suitable matched donor. Ten children, median age 12 years (range, 3-17), were transplanted from haploidentical family donors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4), acute myelogenous leukemia (n=2), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). Parents were donors for nine, sibling for one patient. T-cell depletion of HSC was performed using CellPro followed by antiCD2/CD3 depletion in 7, and CliniMacs magnetic sorting in 3 grafts. Primary engraftment was achieved in nine patients. Patient with graft failure was successfully re-grafted. Primary acute GVHD was diagnosed in one patient who got higher amount of T-cells in the graft. Secondary GVHD was induced by add-backs of lymphocytes in four patients. Three patients developed chronic GVHD. Four patients died due to transplant related mortality (40%), one from veno-occlusive disease, two due to CMV pneumonia and one of aspergillosis with extensive chronic GVHD. Four patients relapsed with leukemia within 35-98 days post transplant, three without previous signs of GVHD, and all died. Two patients are alive and well 26 and 42 months after transplant. Haploidentical family donors appear to be a reasonable alternative option for patients with urgent indications for allogeneic transplant and/or without a matched donor.
