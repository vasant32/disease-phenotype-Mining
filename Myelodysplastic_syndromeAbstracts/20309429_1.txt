The purpose of this overview is to discuss the changes in the 2008 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms, with exclusion of acute myeloid leukaemia. Specific mutations or rearrangements leading to constitutive activation of growth factor receptors or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are now recognised as recurrent genetic events characterising the group of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A newly introduced subgroup consists of patients with persistent eosinophilia and myeloid or lymphoid proliferations harbouring specific genetic changes involving platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFRA and PDGFRB) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). The clinical relevance of recognising myeloid neoplasms with aberrant tyrosine kinase activity is based in novel treatment options with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without increased blasts are further divided into subtypes of refractory cytopaenias with unilineage dysplasia. A new provisional entity is refractory cytopaenia of childhood. Down syndrome- and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, were moved to the section of acute myeloid leukaemia and related precursor neoplasms.
