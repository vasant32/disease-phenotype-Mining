Isochromosome 17q is a relatively common karyotypic  abnormality in medulloblastoma, gastric, bladder, and breast cancers. In  myeloid disorders, it is observed during disease progression and evolution to  acute myeloid leukemia in Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. It  has been reported in rare cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, with an incidence  of 0.4-1.57%. Two new agents have been approved for treatment of  myelodysplastic syndrome/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. These are the  hypomethylating agents, 5-azacytidine and decitabine, recommended by consensus  guidelines for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients not eligible for hematopoietic  stem cell transplantation. We present a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  with normal cytogenetics at diagnosis treated with decitabine (with good  response); however, the patient evolved to acute myeloid leukemia with i(17q)  shortly after suspending treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the  first report of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes with  i(17q) after the use of a hypomethylating agent.
