Since all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces complete remission in a high proportion of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and its effectiveness appears to be related to the plasma or serum level, a pharmacokinetic study of ATRA was undertaken in nine patients with various leukemias. After oral administration at a dose of 30 mg/m2, the time required to reach the peak plasma level of ATRA (20-1198 ng/ml) was between 120 and 240 min and the apparent plasma elimination half life was 21-51 min. In addition, 13-cis retinoic acid was detected in the plasma of seven patients, indicating the occurrence of ATRA isomerization in vivo. ATRA therapy did not induce complete remission in all patients, even when high plasma levels were achieved. Among the six APL patients given ATRA therapy, one who failed to respond had a very low plasma ATRA level. These findings suggest that it may be useful to monitor plasma levels during oral ATRA therapy in order to achieve an appropriate treatment regimen.
