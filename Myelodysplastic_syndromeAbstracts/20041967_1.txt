Unexplained anemia in the elderly could represent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We assessed the utility of using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel for common chromosomal abnormalities seen in MDS. A total of 101 elderly outpatients with anemia of unknown etiology were evaluated. Complete blood count, bone marrow biopsy, conventional cytogenetic analysis (CC), and FISH panel were reviewed. A total of 21 (21%) of the 101 patients had MDS. A combination of CC and FISH identified chromosomal abnormalities in 17 (81%) of the patients with MDS. The remaining 4 (19%) were diagnosed with MDS based solely on morphologic criteria. Except in two cases, FISH did not reveal abnormalities not already detected by CC. Furthermore, MDS patients infrequently had isolated anemia (14%) as opposed to those without MDS (75%). A MDS FISH panel is not more sensitive than CC in elderly outpatients with unexplained anemia. MDS is more likely if in addition to anemia, leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are also present.
