The feasibility and effects of combination chemotherapy for very elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia was examined in 65 patients (including previous myelodysplastic syndrome) aged 76 years or morewith a performance status of 0 - 3. Induction chemotherapy was performed with 30 mg/m2 daunorubicin on days 1 - 3, 150 mg/m2 behenoyl cytosine arabinoside on days 1 - 7, and 70 mg/m2 6-mercaptopurine with 300 mg allopurinol taken orally on days 1 - 7 (BHAC-DM). The complete remission (CR) rate was 38.5%, whereas overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 22.0% and 4.7%, respectively. Two- and 5-year survival of CR patients was 41.8% and 11.2%, respectively. The relapse rate of the 25 CR patients was 64.0% and disease-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 21.0% and 11.2%, respectively. The therapy-related mortality rate at induction was 13.8%. BHAC-DM is feasible and effective for selected very elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients.
