We have tried to improve existing methods for demonstration of platelet peroxidase (PPO) in human platelets and megakaryocytes by introducing a fixation of 0.1% glutaraldehyde prior to incubation in the DAB medium. This prefixation with low concentration of glutaraldehyde preserves excellent morphological detail and does not inhibit PPO activity. All 23 platelet-rich plasma samples show PPO reaction product in the dense tubular system after incubation in DAB medium with 0.003% H2O2. When 0.01% H2O2 is used in excessive DAB medium, PPO activity can also be demonstrated in platelets and megakaryocytes of bone-marrow cell suspensions. This method can be used for the identification of megakaryoblasts in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and in blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. PPO cytochemistry can be combined with postfixation in a OsO4-ruthenium red mixture. This method reveals alpha-granules, dense bodies, microtubuli, glycogen, mitochondria, dense tubular system and invaginated membrane system in the same platelet and is useful for investigation of platelet ultrastructure.
