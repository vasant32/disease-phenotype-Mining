In addition to a few disorders such as acute T-cell leukemia that are typically associated with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) 1 in endemic regions, this virus may also play a role in some other hematological diseases. Here, we examine the incidence of HTLV in hematological diseases from a nonendemic region in central Europe. Data obtained by PCR and/or serological techniques from a total of 730 cases showed that besides the expected presence of HTLV-1 in T-lymphoid diseases (2 of 27 cases), HTLV-1 was only detected in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which an incidence of 17% (11 of 65 cases) was found. A correlation with a history of multiple transfusions or treatment with blood products in the HTLV-1-positive MDS could not be ascertained. Cytogenetics detected the presence of del(5)(q) in six HTLV-positive cases (five MDS and one T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia) but in only one HTLV-negative case. These data indicate that allelic deletions of a series of 5q-located genes that typically occur in MDS may be associated with HTLV infections in central Europe.
