20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were treated with danazol, 800 mg daily in 4 divided doses. 18 patients were evaluable for response. 3 patients (17%), whose principal problem was anemia, responded to treatment, but only with an increase in platelet count. Responses were short-lived and lacked clinical significance. No patients with anemia or leukopenia responded to treatment and none of the 7 patients with a platelet count less than 30 x 10(9)/l responded. Danazol appears to have limited clinical utility in the treatment of MDS. However, occasional patients with thrombocytopenia may benefit.
