The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor system with dispersionless microfluidics for the direct and label-free detection of a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR-1) is described. The detection approach takes advantage of an affinity interaction between sVEGFR-1 and its ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), which is covalently immobilized on the surface of the SPR sensor. The ability of the immobilized VEGF-A to specifically bind the sVEGFR-1 receptor is demonstrated in a buffer. The detection of sVEGFR-1 in 2% human blood plasma is carried out by using the sequential injection approach. The detection limit of 25 ng/mL is achieved. In addition, we demonstrate that the functional surface of the sensor can be regenerated for repeated use.
