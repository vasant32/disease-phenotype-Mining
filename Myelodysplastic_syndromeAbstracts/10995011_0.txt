Interleukin-12 (IL-12) has potent antitumor activities. We examined whether IL-12 enhanced the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and decreased leukemia cells in 30 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (five in complete remission (CR) and seven in non-CR); six chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); and 12 MDS (three refractory anemia (RA), eight RA with excess of blasts and one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). PBMNC from patients and five healthy volunteers were cultured at 5 x 10(5)/ml parallel with or without 100 units/ml of IL-12 for 3 days. Cytotoxicity of PBMNC against K562 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To quantify the amount of leukemia cells, WT1 mRNA was measured by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), since WT1 mRNA is considered as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia or MDS. The cytotoxicity of non-IL-12-treated PBMNC of 30 patients was 13.4+/-9.3% at the effector to target (E:T) ratio of 20:1, and significantly lower than that of normal subjects (25.7+/-8.4%). The cytotoxicity increased to 30.6+/-17.9% in the IL-12-treated PBMNC. WT1 mRNA in PBMNC of five healthy volunteers was less than 10(3) copies/microg of total RNA. Following the 3-day IL-12 treatment, mean WT1 mRNA of PBMNC was reduced from 10(4.8) to 10(4.2) copies/microg of total RNA in six CML patients, from 10(5.4) to 10(4.8) copies/microg in 12 MDS patients and from 10(5.0) to 10(4.2) copies/microg in five AML patients in CR, but not reduced in five of seven AML in non-CR. These results showed that IL-12 significantly enhanced PBMNC cytotoxicity and decreased the quantity of leukemia cells in PBMNC of most patients with MDS, CML and AML in CR. IL-12 might be of considerable benefit in the elimination of MRD in patients with hematological malignancies.
