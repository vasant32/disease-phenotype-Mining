Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin synthesis in adulthood can be seen in hematological disorders affecting the erythropoietic system. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the incidence and prognostic significance of increased hemoglobin F in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Hemoglobin F concentrations and Ggamma/Ggamma + A gamma-globin chain ratios were determined in 26 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome. Median age of the patients was 65 years; all FAB subtypes were included. Increased hemoglobin F concentration of up to 20% of total hemoglobin (normal: below 2%) was seen in 16 patients; ten patients had normal values. There was a significant relation between hemoglobin F concentration and the course of disease, e.g., 12 of the 16 patients with elevated hemoglobin F survived at least 1 year after the examination, in contrast to only three of the ten patients with normal hemoglobin F (p < 0.025). All of six patients with hemoglobin F above 5% survived at least 1 year. There was no significant difference in the hemoglobin F concentration between patients with and without cytogenetic anomalies. The Ggamma/Ggamma + A gamma-globin chain ratio was slightly elevated in all patients, with a weak correlation to the degree of hemoglobin F elevation. The values were not of additional prognostic significance. The data of the present study suggest that the hemoglobin F concentration may be a prognostic parameter in myelodysplastic syndrome; increased hemoglobin F concentration may indicate a better prognosis.
