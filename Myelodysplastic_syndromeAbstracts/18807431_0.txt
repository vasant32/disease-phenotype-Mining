Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary localized tumoral lesion of myeloid precursors. It is composed of immature cells of the granulocytic series known to occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia. We present a 29-year-old female who was admitted to hospital for lesions that appeared on the face, lips and nose, mimicking lepromatous leprosy. It should be kept in mind that granulocytic sarcoma may mimick lepromatous leprosy.
