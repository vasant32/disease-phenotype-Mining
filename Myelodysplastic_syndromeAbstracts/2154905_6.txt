A patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation, RAEB-T) presented with generalized granulocytic sarcomas involving the skin. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin and bone marrow biopsies. Partial myeloperoxidase deficiency was noted in the circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the more differentiated tumor cells in the granulocytic sarcoma. This observation suggests that such leukocytes may be derived from the abnormal 'leukemic' clone.
