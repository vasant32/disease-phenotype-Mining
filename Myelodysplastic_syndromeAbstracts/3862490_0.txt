In leukemia and preleukemic disorders the progeny of a single cell proliferate and ultimately come to occupy the hemopoietic system. In the process normal stem cells are suppressed and in time may become extinct. This implies that neoplastic clones have a biological advantage. In this paper evidence is presented that the cloning of granulocytic colony forming cells in the clonal hemopathies is influenced by cell products that regulate cloning of normal colony forming cells. We have attempted to develop an approach to the study of clone-clone interactions in order to determine at what level(s) the battle between clones is fought. Future studies on relative responsiveness might help in understanding the mechanisms by which normal hemopoiesis is suppressed during the evolution of leukemia and re-established during remission induction.
