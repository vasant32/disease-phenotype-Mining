Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene expression is increased in patients with leukemia as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and is useful for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). A 47-year-old man given a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) received myeloablative therapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). MRD by WT1 expression was not detected in the graft. The patient has been in CR for 25 months after PBSCT. These observations suggest that PBSCT is feasible for patients with RAEB-T and analysis of WT1 expression can be applied for patients with high risk MDS.
