The automated hematology cell analyzer Coulter LH 750 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) uses a combination of 3 measurements-volume, conductivity, and scatter-to identify cells, but it could take advantage of these parameters to evaluate their morphologic changes. The neutrophil mean cell volume (MNEV), mean cell conductivity (MNEC), and mean cell scatter (MNES) were evaluated in 54 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 18 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 59 healthy controls. MNES and MNEC in the MDS group including all subtypes (World Health Organization classification) and in the CMML patients were significantly lower than the control group. MNES in MDS and CMML correlated well with the cytoplasmic hypogranularity evaluated by microscopic observation (P = .01). The value of MNES and MNEC as screening parameters in the neutrophil dysplasia evaluation showed, for this study, a sensitivity of 71.8% with a specificity of 86.4% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.817) and a cutoff of <139.3 for MNES and a sensitivity of 70.4% with a specificity of 76.3% (AUC, 0.752) and a cutoff of <150.9 for MNEC.
