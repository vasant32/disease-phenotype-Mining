Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is an extramedullary tumor composed of immature cells of the granulocytic series known to occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is relatively rare in GS. We present an extremely rare case of GS of the colon and liver infiltration in a 60-year-old male patient with AML presenting with jaundice and hematochezia and review the literature. It should be kept in mind that hematochezia may be due to colonic involvement of GS besides thrombocytopenia which is usually encountered in patients with AML.
