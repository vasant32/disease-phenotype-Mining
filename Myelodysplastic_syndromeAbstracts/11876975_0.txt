OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression and function of c-kit receptor on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of the patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: c-kit protein (CD(117)) was detected by direct immunofluorescence assay, c-kit mRNA by reverse transcriptive polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the function of c-kit receptor by cell culture. RESULTS: c-kit protein expression in MDS was significantly higher than that in control [(8.58 +/- 5.28)% vs (3.04 +/- 1.49)%, P < 0.05]. c-kit protein expression in RA patients was significantly lower than that in RAEB/RAEB-t patients [(5.12 +/- 2.13)% vs (10.01 +/- 5.07)%, P < 0.05]. The rate of c-kit protein expression was (32.43 +/- 18.16)% in AML cases transformed from MDS (t-AML). c-kit mRNA expression in MDS was correlated with c-kit protein expression. Addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3), erythropoietin (Epo) and stem cell factor (SCF) to the semi-solid culture of BMMNC showed significant stimulating effects on CFU-GM and BFU-E formation in normal controls, but did not in MDS patients. CONCLUSION: The protein and mRNA expressions of c-kit receptor on BMMNC in MDS are higher than those in normal control, and the function of this receptor in MDS is abnormal.
