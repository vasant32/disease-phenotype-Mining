There was no overall increase in PB-CFU-GM from normal subjects, or MDS patients, when exogenous CSA (5637-CM) was added to the culture medium. However, there was a sub-group of MDS patients (seven of 35) whose PB-CFU-GM numbers were significantly stimulated by 5637-CM. In addition, there were 11 (out of 48) MDS patients with undetectable PB-CFU-GM in assays without exogenous CSA but only two when 5637-CM was added (p less than 0.01). This sub-group is of particular interest as it is known that those without detectable PB-CFU-GM tend to have significantly shorter survival times than others. The mechanism of the functional abnormality is yet to be determined.
