OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Fuzheng Quxie Tablet (FZQXT) in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Thirty-three cases of MDS were treated with FZQXT, changes of peripheral blood cells, morphology of bone marrow smear, bone marrow pathology and immunology were monitored before and after treatment. The effects of FZQXT on hematopoietic stem cells of mice were also observed. RESULTS: The remission rate and total effective rate were 24.24% and 72.72% respectively. FZQXT had obvious effect in promoting the proliferation of colony forming unit-erythrocytes (CFU-E). CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of FZQXT in treating refractory anemia might be reached through promoting the proliferation of erythrocytic hematopoietic stem cells.
