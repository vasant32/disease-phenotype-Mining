The reciprocal translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 8 and 21, t(8;21), is usually restricted to cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Cases of AML with t(8;21) exhibit characteristic dysplastic features in myeloid and erythroid lineages with reduction in megakaryocytes. We report details of three patients presenting with myelodysplastic features; two had a typical t(8;21), and the third had a variant t(8;21) translocation. We discuss the significance of t(8;21) in the aetiology of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and implications for the management of such patients.
