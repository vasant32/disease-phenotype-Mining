We evaluated the effect of SCF on myeloid differentiation by correlating clonogenic potential (as CFU-GM), bone marrow (BM) plasma SCF levels and CD34/c-kit expression in 57 MDS samples. There was a significant correlation between low SCF levels and 'leukemic' in vitro growth, the number of clusters and the colony/cluster ratio. No correlation was found between BM plasma SCF levels, the pattern of growth and CD34+ c-kit+ expression. These data seem to exclude any direct effect of SCF on leukemogenesis, but suggest that low plasma SCF levels may be at least partially responsible for leukemic growth in MDS.
