Five cases of myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with cytarabine ocfosfate. Ocfosfate (100-200 mg) was orally administered for 14 days with 14 days' interval. Etoposide was combined in one case, and nartograstim was added in two cases. Two of the five cases achieved remission, one case having complete remission, and another case showing a good response. Their remission durations were 141 and 112 days, respectively. Further improvement of therapy is needed to achieve a higher remission rate and a longer remission duration.
