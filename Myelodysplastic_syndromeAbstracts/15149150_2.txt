Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of hematological clonal malignancies. Patients belonging to the refractory anemia (RA) subtype are usually treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). Not all patients respond to EPO administration and they are strictly dependent on supportive therapy with red cell blood (RBC) transfusions. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an alternative combination regimen containing EPO, low-dose methylprednisolone and nandrolone decanoate, in patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone. Ten patients, 4 women and 6 men, median age: 70 years (range: 55-78 years) with refractory anemia unresponsive to EPO administration and RBC transfusion-dependent were included in the study. Median hematological data at baseline were Hb: 8.7 g/dl, (range 6.2-9.8), WBC: 3.35x10(9)/l (range 2.1-4), PLT: 82.5x10(9)/l (range 59-110). EPO 150 U/Kg three times/week subcutaneously, low-dose methylprednisolone 8 mg/day orally and nandrolone decanoate (Decadurabolin) 50 mg two-times/week intramuscularly were administered. As complete response (CR) to treatment was considered the normalization of the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and biopsy. As partial response (PR) was considered increase in Hb level > or = 2 g/dl, or up to 10 g/dl and discontinuation of RBC transfusions. The response to therapy was evaluated on the 4th week after the initiation of the combination treatment. Bone marrow smear evaluation was carried out at baseline and every six months afterwards. After a 4-week treatment all patients achieved PR and discontinued RBC transfusions. Median and range hematological values on the 4th week after treatment initiation were Hb: 11.2 g/dl, (range: 9.8-12.8), WBC: 4.4x10(9)/l (3.5-6.6), PLT: 130x10(9)/l (95-160). The increase observed in hematological values was significant (p = 0.0001, 0.0004 and < 0.0001, respectively, for Hb, WBC and PLT counts). Treatment was well tolerated. Furthermore, two women, on treatment with the combination regimen, achieved CR one after six months and the second after 12 months. They are alive after 5 years from initiation of the combination treatment. After a median period of 18 months (range 12 to 20 months) in PR three men developed acute leukemia; they received intensive antileukemic chemotherapy without any response and died during the phase of pancytopenia. Three other men achieved CR, one after 6 and two after 12 months of therapy and they are on regular follow-up. Two women after 10 and 14 months in PR developed acute leukemia and died. In conclusion, combination therapy with EPO, nandrolone decanoate and low-dose methylprednisolone may be effective as an alternative treatment for RBC transfusion-dependent patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone.
