Acid alpha naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and combined ANAE-chloroacetate esterase cytochemistry was performed on 121 bone marrow aspirates from primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and a secondary dysplasia-megaloblastic anaemia (MA). The investigation demonstrated the presence of abnormal ANAE positive granulocyte populations in a significant proportion of cases. These cells, in which the staining patterns were characterized by atypical granular ANAE positivity and double ANAE-chloroacetate reactions, were shown immunologically to lack the receptor and antigenic characteristics of monocytes and morphologically to be granulocytes. Isoelectric focusing, however, indicated that the atypical esterase cytochemistry of these granulocytes was due to the presence of markedly increased concentrations of ANAE isoenzymes usually found in monocytes. Atypical ANAE-staining granulocytes were particularly evident in MDS marrows showing sideroblastic erythroid changes, whilst in MA they were mainly seen in cases of intermediate severity. It is suggested that these cells are associated with dysmyelopoietic changes in both malignant and non-malignant conditions.
