The mechanism of action of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in the treatment of aplastic anaemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is poorly understood and may involve many different mechanisms. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate further the effect of ATG on haemopoietic progenitor cells. A total of 16 patients (10 AA and 6 MDS) and 12 normal control subjects were studied. Purified bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells were cultured in committed progenitor assay in the presence of ATG and autologous serum, then scored on day 14 for granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and erythroid colonies. ATG was found to be inhibitory to haemopoietic progenitor cells at high concentrations (1000 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml). This was confirmed by CD34-FITC and 7AAD staining of purified normal CD34+ cells after overnight incubation with ATG. In contrast, at lower doses (0.1-10 microg/ml), ATG produced an increase in colony growth in most normal, MDS and AA BM CD34+ cells. The greatest effect was in patients with non-severe AA, in whom the greatest increase in CFU-GM was seen at 0.5 microg/ml (P < 0.02) and 0.1 microg/ml (P = 0.02) and erythroid colonies at 0.1 microg/ml (P < 0.05). Serum ATG levels peaked during infusion to levels that were found to be toxic to haemopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and fell thereafter to levels that were associated with the highest colony numbers (0.1 and 0.5 microg/ml) in vitro. These results suggest that an increase in haemopoietic progenitor cells by ATG may be one of several important mechanisms for haematological recovery in AA and MDS.
