Chromosomal abnormalities are detected in 40-60% of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This study used the FISH technique in 773 patients with de novo MDS without evidence of monosomy 7 (-7) or 7q deletion (7q-) by conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CC) to analyze their prognostic impact by FISH alone. FISH detected -7/7q- in 5.2% of patients. Presence of -7/7q- was associated with shorter overall survival than absence of such aberrations. Our results suggest that FISH 7q could be beneficial in patients with intermediate WHO morphologic risk stratification and no evidence of -7/7q- by CC.
