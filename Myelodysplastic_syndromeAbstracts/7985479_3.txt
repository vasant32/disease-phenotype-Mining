Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with t(9;11)(p22;q23) developed in a child after intensive treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed 12 months earlier. His chemotherapy had consisted mainly of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, but no epipodophyllotoxins. The combination of MDS, the cytogenetic anomaly involving bands at 11q23 and no previous exposure to epipodophyllotoxins represents a unique case of therapy-related leukemia.
