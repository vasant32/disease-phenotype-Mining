We describe here the development of a murine system for the identification of genes involved in myelomonocytic neoplasms. Transgenic C57BL/6J mice expressing SV40 early region under a myelomonocytic promoter develop histiocytic sarcomas with a latency of 167 days. We used retroviral proviral tagging to accelerate tumorigenesis and to uncover genetic changes that contribute to tumor development. Infection of transgenic mice with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) shortened the latency of morbidity to 103 days (P< 0.001); this was associated with clonal proviral integrations in tumor DNA. As expected for F-MuLV, proviral insertions occurred at Fli1 in both transgenic and nontransgenic tumors. Four insertions were found at a novel locus, termed Fim4, on chromosome 6. This region is syntenic to human 7q32, a region that is commonly deleted in human myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. A murine BAC containing Fim4 was sequenced and analyzed, and while there was significant human-mouse homology in the area of the insertions, no candidate gene has been identified. Thus we have established a system to identify genes involved in myelomonocytic tumors, and have used it to identify Fim4, a new common site of proviral insertion. Study of this locus may provide insight into genes involved in AML-associated 7q32 deletions in humans.
