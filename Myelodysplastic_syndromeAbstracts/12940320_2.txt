Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a relatively rare, heterogeneous syndrome classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome according to the French-American-British classification system. The patient's presenting symptom was a pigmented skin nodule that, although common for cases of acute monoblastic leukemia, is peculiar for CMML. This case should increase awareness of the inclusion of CMML in the differential diagnosis of a discolored nodule and highlight the clinicopathologic considerations and therapeutic challenges consistent with the diagnosis of CMML.
