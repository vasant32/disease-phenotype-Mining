Two patients with dysmyelopoietic syndrome presented the same cytogenetic pattern in their bone marrow cells, i.e., trisomy of chromosomes #1 and #11, and terminal deletion of chromosome #5 (q13-q14). Two similar cases have been described in the literature. It is suggested that this cytogenetic pattern could be a nonrandom event.
