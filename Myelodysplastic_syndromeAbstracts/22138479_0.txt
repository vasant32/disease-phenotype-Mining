Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal stem cell diseases that can result in cytopenias, dysplasia in one or more cell lineages, infective hematopoiesis, and increase the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDSs are characterized by several recurrent cytogenetic defects, which can affect diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Some of that chromosomal alterations are associated with very poor prognosis. Conventional cytogenetics cannot accurately define the rearranged karyotype. Instead, molecular cytogenetics analyses can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information for patients affected by MDS, allowing the characterization of the whole mutational spectrum and, mainly, novel chromosomal lesions. In this paper, we report a MDS case with a novel chromosomal translocation [t(17;22)(q12;q22)], described for the first time here. Following Giemsa-banding karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, by using chromosome-specific probes, displayed the breakpoint regions at chromosomes 17 and 22, within which intra and inter-chromosomal segmental duplications (SD) are present. Because of the occurrence of SDs in breakpoint region, it was not possible to finely define the genomic regions where breaks fell. Further investigations could be required to better understand the molecular basis of the novel translocation t(17;22)(q12;q12) acting in MDS context and to explain if SDs could contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS.
