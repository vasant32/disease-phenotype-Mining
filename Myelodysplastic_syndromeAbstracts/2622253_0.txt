Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are disorders characterized by a profound impairment of proliferation and maturation of hematopoietic cells. The prognosis is poor owing to the occurrence of severe cytopenia or to the common leukemic transformation of these conditions. At present there is no available effective treatment for patients with MDS. A patient is reported with simple refractory anemia which responded to therapy with high doses of maturative factors (folic acid and vitamin B12). This therapy resulted in the disappearance of transfusion requirements and in the increase of peripheral blood cell counts. It is concluded that, in view of the lack of toxicity of the treatment with madurative factors, this therapy should be attempted in a sequential fashion in all patients with MSD.
