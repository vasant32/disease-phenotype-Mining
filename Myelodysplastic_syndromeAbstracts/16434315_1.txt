Cytogenetically unrelated clones are uncommon findings in hematologic disorders. In the present study, among the 1,110 various hematologic malignancies analyzed during the past seven years, 27 (2.4%) patients had karyotypically unrelated clones: 3.5% (7/202) of acute myeloid leukemias, 5.3% (11/206) of myelodysplastic syndromes, none of 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 0.4% (1/233) of myeloproliferative disorders, and 2.6% (8/306) lymphoproliferative disorders with clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Twenty-five patients showed two unrelated clones and two had three unrelated clones. The most consistent chromosome abnormalities were del(5q) (seven cases), +8 (six cases), del(20q) (five cases), and del(7q), +12, +21, and -22 (three cases each). Of interest, the high frequency of different numeric or structural abnormalities affecting the same chromosomes in such clones supports the hypothesis that these karyotypically unrelated clones originate from the common malignant clone through submicroscopic molecular genetic changes and evolutionary processes.
