Although immune mechanisms are known to be partially responsible for the thrombocytopenia of patients infected with HIV-1, an understanding of the mechanism underlying this disorder is incomplete. A casual observation that bone marrow biopsies of HIV-infected individuals seem to exhibit an unusually large number of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei (DN-MK) prompted a study comparing MK of 20 HIV-seropositive individuals with those of 10 patients with HIV-negative idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and 10 hematologically normal subjects. In normal marrows the number of DN-MK average 2.1 +/- 0.5 SE per 10 low power field. In patients with ITP the average number was 6.5 +/- 1.4 SEM, whereas HIV-ITP marrows had an average of 42.5 +/- 3.7 SEM. Electron microscopy of AIDS megakaryocytes exhibited ballooning of the peripheral zone to an extent not seen by us in any other myelodysplastic syndromes. These observations support the concept that the pathophysiology affecting MK/platelets in HIV-infection should not be equated with the destructive process underlying other immune thrombocytopenias.
