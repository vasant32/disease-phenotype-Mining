MRSA infection or colonization developed in eleven patients with neoplastic disease including malignant lymphoma (5 cases), soft tissue sarcoma (2 cases), acute myeloblastic leukemia (one), myelodysplastic syndrome (one), multiple myeloma (one), and mesothelioma (one) at our ward from October to December 1999. The infections were pneumonia (six cases), enteritis (three), bacteremia (one), and wound infection (one). Ten of 11 cases received antimicrobial agent (s) during one month before isolation of MRSA, suggesting selection of MRSA. Five cases improved and survived, but six cases died of infection. At the isolation of MRSA, the neutrophil count (NC) of the alive cases was 1, 500/microliter or more but the NC of five cases who died was less than 1,000/microliter, especially less than 100/microliter in three cases who had just received a cancer chemotherapy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, performed in 9 cases, showed an identical DNA-pattern of MRSA in 7 cases, indicating a nosocomial infection. Our method to prevent spread of MRSA targeting solely the patients with MRSA infection was obviously unsatisfactory. We should target also the cases of MRSA colonization and make an effort to wash hands more vigorously. Furthermore, radical reformation such as increasing single sick-rooms drastically and increasing the number of nursing staff is also required.
