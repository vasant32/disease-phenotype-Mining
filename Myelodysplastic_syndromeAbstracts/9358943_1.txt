Four case histories are reported in which the initial signs and symptoms were those of pulmonary infiltration and in which subsequently a diagnosis of myelodysplasia was made. The analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid--demonstrating predominantly neutrophils and lymphocytes, and, occasionally blast cells as well as plasma cells--indicated that the pulmonary infiltration was related to the myelodysplastic process. As no other causes of pulmonary infiltration could be found, it seems that a pulmonary infiltrate can be the presenting symptom of a myelodysplastic syndrome. Although pleuropulmonary infiltrates most often are caused by infections, these cases illustrate that myelodysplasia related infiltrates should also be considered.
