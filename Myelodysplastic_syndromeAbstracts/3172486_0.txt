The chromosome changes in early cancer had been thought to be difficult to analyse because of the technical reasons and of the complex nature of the chromosomal abnormalities as compared with hematological diseases having simple diploid karyotype. Recent advances allowed to analyse the chromosomes of solid tumors by the improved technics for cell disaggregation, short term culture, and chromosome banding. Although some advanced solid cancers kept the simple near by diploid chromosomal features, many tumors such as cervical cancers reveal complex chromosomal changes already in the pre-invasive stage. Much more data must be collected to evaluate the role of chromosomal changes in benign and early malignant tumors.
