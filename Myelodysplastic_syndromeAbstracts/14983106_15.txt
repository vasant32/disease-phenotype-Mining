OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical aspects and evolution of autoimmune inflammatory manifestations (AIMs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and ascertain the prognostic implications of these manifestations in MDS. METHODS: Seventy patients diagnosed for MDS were enrolled in a prospective cohort study of 4-yr duration. Thirteen patients with AIMs were identified (group A). The remaining 57 MDS patients without AIMs constituted the control group (group B). Demographic, clinical features, laboratory data, treatment and outcome of all these cases were recorded. RESULTS: On comparing features between the two groups we were unable to identify any particular difference (P > or = 0.05) concerning bone marrow blast count [odds ratio (OR) = 0.68], international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) (OR = 1.36), favourable cytogenetic abnormalities (OR = 0.52), leukaemic transformation (OR = 1.30) and survival (P = 0.76). Furthermore there was a significant difference in survival between low vs non-low IPSS patients for both groups (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: In a 4-yr prospective study the prognosis of MDS patients with AIMs appeared to be closely related to the IPSS subcategory of the underlying haematological malignancy and not to the autoimmune process.
