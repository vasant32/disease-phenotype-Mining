Involvement of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bone marrow transplantation (BMT)-associated complications has been documented. Biological response to TNF requires interaction with specific cell membrane receptors. Extracellular domains of these receptors are released into body fluids as soluble molecules, and participate in the bioactivity of TNF. Serum levels of p55 and p75 soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFR) were determined in 34 patients with different diseases who underwent BMT. Sequential studies initiated 10 days before BMT and continued up to 110 days post-transplantation showed that p55 and p75 sTNFR levels were elevated significantly in patients who subsequently developed major transplant-related complications (TRC). Moreover, both sTNFR levels were increased 2- to 3-fold over control values during post-BMT febrile periods in those patients who at a later stage suffered major TRC. These results indicate that the serum level of sTNFR may be used as a prognostic marker for major TRC in BMT.
