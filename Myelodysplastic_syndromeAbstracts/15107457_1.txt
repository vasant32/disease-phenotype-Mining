The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by human neutrophils is imperative for their bactericidal activity. Proinflammatory agents such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can prime ROS production in response to chemoattractants such as N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP). In neutrophils from patients suffering from Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a clonal, hematological disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, this GM-CSF priming is severely impaired. In this study, we set out to further delineate the defects in neutrophils from MDS patients. We examined the effect of GM-CSF priming on fMLP-triggered activation of Rac, a small GTPase implicated in neutrophil ROS production. In contrast to healthy neutrophils, activation of Rac in response to fMLP was not enhanced by GM-CSF pretreatment in MDS neutrophils. Furthermore, activation of Rac was attenuated by pretreatment of neutrophils with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor LY294002. Unlike healthy neutrophils, fMLP-induced accumulation of the PI-3K lipid product PI(3,4,5)trisphosphate was not increased by GM-CSF pretreatment in MDS neutrophils. The disturbed Rac and PI-3K activation observed in MDS neutrophils did not appear to reflect a general GM-CSF or fMLP receptor-signaling defect, as fMLP-triggered Ras activation could be primed by GM-CSF in MDS and healthy neutrophils. Moreover, fMLP-induced activation of the GTPase Ral was also normal in neutrophils from MDS patients. Taken together, our data suggest that in neutrophils from MDS patients, a defect in priming of the PI-3K-Rac signaling pathway, located at the level of PI-3K, results in a decreased GM-CSF priming of ROS production.
