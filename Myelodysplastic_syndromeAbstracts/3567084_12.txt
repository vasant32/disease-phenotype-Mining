Two brothers developed hypoplastic anaemia with the development in one of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) accompanied by emergence of monosomy 7. Both brothers have a constitutional inversion of chromosome 1. Neither shows the increased chromosomal fragility of Fanconi's anaemia or its variants. This family is the third reported in which monosomy 7 has been found when leukaemic or preleukaemic transformation has occurred in patients with familial hypoplastic anaemia.
