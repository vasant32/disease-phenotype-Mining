The serine/threonine kinase Akt, a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), is known to play an important role in antiapoptotic signaling and has been implicated in the aggressiveness of a number of different human cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) to AML is thought to be associated with abrogation of apoptotic control mechanisms. However, little is known about signal transduction pathways which may be involved in enhanced survival of MDS cells. In this report, we have performed immunocytochemical and flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the levels of activated Akt in bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients diagnosed with MDS. We observed high levels of Ser473 phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) staining in 90% of the cases (n=22) diagnosed as high-risk MDS, whereas mononuclear cells from normal bone marrow or low-risk MDS patients showed low or absent Ser473 p-Akt staining. Furthermore, all high-risk MDS patients also demonstrated high expression of the Class I PI3K p110delta catalytic subunit and a decreased expression of PTEN. Taken together, our results suggest that Akt activation might be one of the factors contributing to the decreased apoptosis rate observed in patients with high-risk MDS.
