Paraneoplastic neuropathies have rarely been reported in patients with hematological malignancies. We report herein the case of a 65-year-old Japanese woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) accompanying chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). She had been diagnosed with refractory anemia and subsequently developed CMML with cytogenetic abnormalities including t(3;8)(q26;q24). While regenerating bone marrow following induction chemotherapy, she complained of numbness in the lower legs and then became unable to walk. Clinical and electrophysiological features were consistent with CIDP. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was insufficient, although corticosteroids reduced neurological symptoms. This case suggests CIDP as one of the autoimmune phenomena associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and immunosuppressive treatment represents an effective therapy.
