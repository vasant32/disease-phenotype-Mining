We report here a 71 year-old female presenting with acute myeloblastic leukemia (FAB-M1) after treatment of essential thrombocythemia with Vercyte. Conventional cytogenetic techniques showed a complex karyotype, 44,XX,-5,-7,-11,add(11)(q23),-14,+mar,+r. The use of several fluorescent in situ hybridizations (FISH) lead to the identification of these complex rearrangements. The marker was found to be tricentric, with pericentromeric material of chromosome 7 inserted in the short arm of chromosome 5, resulting in monosomy 5q and 7q. The derivative chromosome 11 was dicentric and had subtelomeric sequences of 11p on both ends; several copies of the MLL gene were located in two different regions separated by a centromere of chromosome 11. Twenty-one cases, including ours, of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia with MLL amplification present in hsr or dmin were found in the literature. Most of these patients shared some characteristics: they were old, they had de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a complex karyotype and a short survival, 90% of them having also a del(5q). Therefore, the simultaneous presence of MLL amplification and del(5q) appears to be a nonrandom association that could be the signature of AML in elderly patients with a poor prognosis.
