A 60-year-old patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) corresponding to refractory anemia with an increase in blast cells (RAEB) was treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) for severe symptomatic pancytopenia. During the GM-CSF treatment a distinct increase in granulocytes was observed, but the reticulocytes and thrombocytes decreased to the point where treatment had to be discontinued after eight days. After subsequent treatment with EPO the reticulocyte count rose from 0% to 2%. However, this rise alone was insufficient to decrease the number of blood transfusions required. The thrombocyte count rose to the original values after the cessation of GM-CSF therapy while continuing treatment with EPO. Bone marrow investigations were performed before and after GM-CSF treatment and indicated a distinct increase in the myeloid precursor cells after therapy, without an increase in blasts. On the other hand, an obvious decrease in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis was observed.
