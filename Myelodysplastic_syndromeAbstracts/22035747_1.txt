Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the treatment of choice for young patients (age â‰¤ 55 years) with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) characterized by poor-risk or intermediate-risk cytogenetics, who have a histocompatible related or unrelated donor. For patients who lack an human leukocyte antigen-compatible donor, autologous SCT, or chemotherapy may be good alternatives for those with MDS and with good-risk cytogenetic characteristics. Iron toxicity is an underestimated cause of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) treatment-related mortality. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and monitoring of iron-induced organ damage are currently topics of investigation. Prospective studies on the prevention or treatment of iron toxicity before HSCT and/or after HSCT are necessary.
