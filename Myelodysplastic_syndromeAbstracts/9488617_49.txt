We report 17 cytopenic patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of refractory anaemia (RA) subtype with hyper-, normo- or hypo-cellular bone marrow (BM), who were treated with cyclosporin A (CyA). Substantial haematological response was observed in 14 patients (82%): their anaemia improved and all transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. Complete trilineage recovery was observed in four patients (23%). The CyA therapy has not yet failed in any of the 14 successfully treated patients during follow-up times ranging from 5 to 30 months. CyA was well tolerated in 14 patients; serious side-effects required termination of the therapy in three patients in whom the blood count rapidly deteriorated to former levels upon cessation of therapy. Two patients benefited from a combination therapy of CyA and erythropoietin. Six patients experienced various autoimmune phenomena. CyA could thus offer an alternative treatment for certain MDS patients with RA regardless of hyper-, normo- or hypo-cellularity of bone marrow (BM). The mechanism of the beneficial effect of CyA is discussed and remains the subject of an ongoing study.
