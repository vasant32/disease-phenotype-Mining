Mastocytosis is a term used for a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells. The cutaneous variants of the disease have to be distinguished from systemic mastocytosis (SM), in which at least one extracutaneous organ is involved. In contrast to cutaneous mastocytosis, SM is often associated with another hematologic neoplasm. In most cases clonal myeloid malignancies such as a myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndrome occur. In a few cases of SM, however, clonal lymphoid disorders have been described. We here report on a case of SM associated with multiple myeloma. At first presentation, the 48-year old female patient showed monoclonal IgGlambda gammopathy and bone marrow (BM) mastocytosis, but no BM plasma cell infiltrates. Eight years later, the patient presented with BM mastocytosis and overt multiple myeloma. The co-existence of myeloma and mastocytosis was demonstrable by staining serial BM sections with antibodies against mast cell tryptase, CD68R, and the plasma cell marker VS38c. Interphase FISH analysis of BM sections revealed a numeric gain of chromosome 5 and chromosome 7 in the plasma cells but not in the mast cell infiltrates, thereby confirming the presence of two different neoplastic cell populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the co-existence of multiple myeloma and mastocytosis.
