Tumorigenesis in humans and experimental animals appears to involve the activation of ras protooncogenes for a number of organ systems and seems to be important to the development of the metastatic phenotype in several model systems. Clinically, the presence of activated ras protooncogenes has been reported to be a negative prognostic factor in the myelodysplastic syndrome and in adenocarcinoma of the lung. In the present study we examined 49 cases of endometrial carcinoma for mutations in the first exon of K-ras using the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Mutations in codon 12 or 13 of K-ras were detected in 6 of 49 cases (12.2%). These six cases consisted of five endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, each of which had a mutation in codon 12, and one case of clear cell carcinoma, which had a mutation in codon 13. In our study the presence of mutations in K-ras appeared to be an unfavorable prognostic factor. Three of six patients with the mutation died during follow-up, while only 7% of the 43 patients without K-ras mutations expired during this same period. In multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model, K-ras activation appeared to be an independent risk factor when compared with clinical stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and patient age. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that K-ras protooncogene activation plays an important role in determining the aggressiveness of endometrial carcinoma.
