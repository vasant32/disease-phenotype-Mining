The bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) shows excessive intramedullary apoptosis, particularly in S-phase cells. In the light of previous reports that showed a link between experimental overexpression of the E2F1 transcription factor and apoptosis in the S phase, we compared the status of E2F1 protein in bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS patients with that of healthy donors. Nearly 67% of MDS marrow samples showed higher expression of E2F1 transcription factor than in healthy donors. The retinoblastoma gene product, Rb, is a major negative regulator of E2F1 activity; however, Rb protein levels were found to be normal in MDS marrow samples. Amplification of genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed no E2F1 gene amplification or mutation in the Rb-binding region of E2F1 in MDS patients, nor was transcriptional up-regulation noted when E2F1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were estimated with real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Furthermore, the overexpression of E2F1 was paralleled by its increased transcriptional activity, as reflected by the increased mRNA levels for one of its target genes, dihydrofolate reductase. Importantly, in a subset of the studied MDS patients for whom a simultaneous measurement of apoptosis in S-phase cells was possible, the E2F1 protein levels showed a significant positive correlation with this phenomenon. Previously, increased E2F1 activity in human disease had been found primarily as a consequence of Rb derailment. Hence, the observation in MDS of increased E2F1 activity in the presence of normal Rb levels is novel and unique, and E2F1 activity in association with apoptosis in S-phase cells may thus have significant therapeutic implications.
