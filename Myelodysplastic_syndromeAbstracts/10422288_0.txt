The 5q- syndrome is a myelodysplastic disorder characterized by macrocytic anemia, hypolobulated micromegakaryocytic hyperplasia, and an interstitial deletion of chromosome 5 as a solitary cytogenetic abnormality. The majority of patients with this syndrome are elderly women exhibiting red blood cell transfusion-dependent refractory anemia with a normal-to-increased number of platelets and modest granulocytopenia. The prognosis is relatively favorable with a low incidence of leukemic transformation. We report on a patient with 5q- syndrome associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHIA) and severe erythroid hypoplasia mimicking pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). A 65-year-old woman was admitted because of severe anemia. Elevated serum levels of LDH and indirect bilirubin, and a positive direct Coombs' test suggested AIHA associated with a huge ovarian dermoid cyst. However, lack of peripheral reticulocytes and bone marrow eryhroblasts, characteristic megakaryocytic morphology, and solitary 5q- anomaly favored a diagnosis of 5q- syndrome complicated by PRCA-like feature. Underlying immunological abnormalities ascribed to aberrant lymphoid clones intrinsic to MDS may be responsible for red cell aplasia and autoantibodies against red blood cells.
