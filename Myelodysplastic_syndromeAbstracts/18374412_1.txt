We report 6 pregnancies in 5 females with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (median age at diagnosis 28 years, range 26-29) observed in the last 15 years. In 2 cases pregnancy was concomitant to the diagnosis of MDS, in the remaining 4 cases the intervals from diagnosis were 2, 3, 4 and 9 years, respectively. One patient had a foetal growth retardation corrected with steroid treatment while the remaining 5 pregnancies were uneventful. After a median time from delivery of 104 months (range 18-187) none of the patients developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and all are alive in stable disease. In conclusion, selected females with low-risk MDS could not be discouraged to have full term pregnancies.
