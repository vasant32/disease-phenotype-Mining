We have analyzed the immunological and genomic characteristics of the lymphoid blast cells present in secondary lymphoid leukemias following either a previous chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Twenty-one of 107 secondary leukemias analyzed displayed a lymphoid phenotype (15 after a CML and 6 after a MDS). Most of the lymphoid blast crises of CML (73%) correspond to pure lymphoid transformation, all of them having a common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) phenotype (CD10+). By contrast, in all MDS cases, lymphoid blast cells coexisted with another myeloid component (hybrid leukemias) and showed an early B phenotype. IgH and TCR-gamma gene rearrangements were detected in the CML-lymphoid blast crisis (86% of cases) more frequently than in the MDS transformations (33%). The TCR-beta gene was in germ line configuration in all cases while TCR-delta gene rearrangements were detected in four cases, all of them corresponding to a previous diagnosis of CML. These results show the existence of both immunophenotypic and genomic differences between the lymphoid transformations of either CML or MDS, which could reflect differences at the stage of maturation of the target cell in these transformations.
