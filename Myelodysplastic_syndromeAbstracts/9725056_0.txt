Low-dose oral etoposide (50 mg for 10 to 14 days) and low-dose subcutaneous injection of cytosine arabinoside (15-20 mg/12 hours for 14 to 17 days) (Et-A non i.v.) were given to refractory acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Case 1 was a 47-year-old woman who had a relapsed M0. B-DOMP therapy failed but she recovered from severe infection. She had to go home to take care of her children. Et-A non i.v. was given for 14 days and 11 mg of mitoxantrone was added on the 3rd day. She achieved a complete remission (CR). Case 2 was a 72-year-old woman classified M4. Low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) with additional daunorubicin (DNR) therapy failed. She became weaker due to the gastrointestinal toxicity of DNR. Et-A non i.v. was tried. Oral etoposide (Et) for 10 days and Ara-C for 14 days proved effective, and she achieved CR. Case 3 was a 59-year-old man with M4 developed from myelodysplastic syndrome, complicated with infection. Ara-C low-dose therapy was begun, but it was not effective. It was switched to Et-A non i.v., 40 mg of DNR was added, with 12 mg of mitoxantrone and double administration of 3 mg of vindesine. He also achieved CR. Et-A non i.v. therapy is effective and available for induction therapy with low toxicity and convenient to daily life.
