Cells from patients with MDS-derived AML display heterogeneous proliferative responses to transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). We analyzed growth inhibition and SMAD2 phosphorylation by TGF beta in CD34+ cells from nine patients, as compared to normal controls. While TGF beta consistently inhibited thymidine incorporation of normal cells (41% of control, P < 0.05), cells from patients with AML were growth-inhibited in only four of seven cases (40%), whereas TGF beta stimulated thymidine incorporation in the three other samples (166%). Remarkably, TPO reverted the stimulatory effect of TGF beta to profound growth inhibition. Upon exposure to TGF beta, SMAD2 protein was phosphorylated in normal CD34+ cells (n = 3), CD34+ leukemic blasts from all examined patients with AML (n = 4), and in the myeloid leukemic cell lines M-07e and HEL. TGF beta inhibited TPO-mediated thymidine incorporation, cell proliferation and survival in all samples analyzed. In M-07e cells and CD34+ cells from healthy donors, this inhibition was enhanced by an antagonist of JAK2 (AG490), but not a MEK-1 antagonist (PD098059). Conversely, in CD34+ cells from a patient with AML, both AG490 and PD098059 significantly enhanced TGF beta-mediated suppression of TPO-induced thymidine incorporation. Thus, in MDS-derived AML, altered responses to TGF beta may be due to defects downstream of SMAD2 and may involve MAPK activation.
