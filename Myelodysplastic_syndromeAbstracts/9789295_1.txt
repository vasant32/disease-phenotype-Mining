A case of Salmonella subdural empyema developed in chronic subdural hematoma (Infected Subdural Hematoma; ISH) was reported. A 64-year-old man had been in a nearby hospital due to myelodysplastic syndrome with cerebral infarction for two months. His condition there had been almost uneventful. But spike fever occurred and the patient became drowsy two days before his transfer to our medical center. His consciousness level deteriorated progressively and CT scan showed a right chronic subdural hematoma. He had had no history of head trauma in the previous two months. On admission to our center, his consciousness level was semicoma with anisocoria. An emergency operation was performed via a single burr hole initially. From the burr hole, old bloody fluid accompanied by yellowish pus was obtained. Thus so-called ISH was diagnosed and the craniotomy was carried out. Gram stain of the specimen revealed gram negative rods. Although an epileptic state developed after the operation, it was controlled by barbiturate coma therapy for 3 days, followed by phenytoin administration. Fever subsided gradually with antibiotics sensitive to the bacteria and his anisocoria disappeared on the 4th postoperative day. In this case, Salmonella enteritidis was detected from bacterial culture both of the specimen and of the arterial blood. Salmonella enteritidis might have been implanted on the capsule of the chronic subdural hematoma by bacteremia derived from immunological dysfunction due to myelodysplastic syndrome. In conclusion, the possibility of ISH should be considered in chronic subdural hematoma patients with immunological dysfunction.
