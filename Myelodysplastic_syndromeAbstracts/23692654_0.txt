Our objective was to recognize the association of autoimmune diseases (AD) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and understand how this association could affect prognosis and management of both diseases. We describe our cohort of 10 patients and 34 patients reported in the English literature in addition to ten cohort studies. Interestingly, four cases showed improvement in AD after 5-azacitidine treatment. The mechanism(s) of the association between AD and MDS are discussed. Treatment could be targeted against AD, MDS or both, though based on recent reports, treating MDS with hypomethylating agents alone could improve the associated AD.
