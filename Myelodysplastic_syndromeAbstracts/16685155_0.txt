Hematological malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma are mainly treated by hospitalization or in outpatient clinics. Therefore, home care and home nursing are not so intensively done in the treatment of these malignancies. However, G-CSF administration against neutropenia after chemotherapy and administration of narcotics or opioids against severe pain have been performed sometimes during home care, and have been contributing to better QOL of the patients.
