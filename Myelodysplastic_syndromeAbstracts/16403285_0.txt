To investigate the morphological changes of megakaryocytes with nuclear extrusion and nucleocytoplasmic separation, the morphological characteristics of megakaryocytes in peripheral blood films, bone marrow smears, and bone marrow biopsies from 4 newly diagnosed patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (M(2)) and erythroleukemia (M(6)) were studied by using light microscope. The results showed that many kinds of dysmegakaryocytes were observed in bone marrow smears of 4 cases, while in case A (PMF) and case D (M(6)) micromegakaryocytes were ripped apart; in case B (MDS) and case C (M(2)) megakaryocytes were accompanied by nuclear extrusion or nucleocytoplasmic separation, and their bodies were large or giant, the part of nucleus separated from their body and little cytoplasm remained as micromegakaryocytes. The nucleocytoplasmic separation could be displayed by immunocytochemistry stain. It is concluded that the phenomenon of nuclear extrusion and nucleocytoplasmic separation in megakaryocytes suggested the process that dispersed multinuclear releasing towards surround or even totally left the cell body during the megakaryocyte maturation. It also showed that the micromegakaryocytes may be the result of nucleocytoplasmic separation or splittings from multi-separated nucleus.
