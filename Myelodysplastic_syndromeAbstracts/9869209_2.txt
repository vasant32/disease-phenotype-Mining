We report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with myelofibrosis and pulmonary tuberculosis who had marked basophilia in the peripheral blood. A clonal karyotypic abnormality characterized by trisomy 8 was demonstrated by cytogenetic analysis. By correlation of cell morphology with results of fluorescence in situ hybridization using a chromosome 8 probe, we demonstrated that the basophils were not reactive but belonged to the neoplastic MDS clone.
