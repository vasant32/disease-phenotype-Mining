The role of the immune system in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progression has been widely accepted, although mechanisms underlying this immune dysfunction are not clear. CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte profiles in the peripheral blood of MDS patients were evaluated and correlated with clinical characteristics, the expression of FOXP3 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10, TGFÎ²1 and CTLA4. IL10 expression inversely correlated with the percentage of CD8(+) cells and was higher in high-risk MDS. Our findings provide further evidence for the role of T cell-mediated IL10 production in MDS and strengthen the idea of distinct cytokine profiles in low and high-risk MDS.
