Southern blot analysis was conducted in 15 patients by using a 1.2 Kb Hind III/Bgl II fragment from the 3' end of the bcr region and a 2.0 Kb Bgl II/Hind III fragment from the 5' end of the bcr as probes. Of the 15 patients in our group, 11 with chronic, myelocytic leukemia (CML), 3 with Ph-negative acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Bcr rearrangements were detected in 9 patients with CML and were negative in the rest of the patients. The results showed that the identification of bcr rearrangement was very important in the diagnosis of Ph-positive leukemias.
