Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, the combination of conventional cytogenetic, FISH studies and molecular techniques allowed us to unveil a novel recurrent t(3;11)(q13;q14) causing the overexpression of the immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor (ILDR1) gene. The analysis of gene expression was extended to Refractory Anemia (RA) and Refractory Anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) cases revealing ILDR1 overexpression in 36% of RAEB subgroup. The biological implications of the ILDR1 overexpression in MDS pathogenesis and its potential prognostic significance should be further investigated.
