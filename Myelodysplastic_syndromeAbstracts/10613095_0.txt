Transplantation of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells is an established curative treatment for certain severe, mainly malignant, bone marrow disorders. The method has a 10-40% treatment related mortality, but it is the best, and for some patients the only, curative option. The ten year survival probability in 214 Norwegian patients transplanted at Rikshospitalet, Oslo, between 1985 and 99 is 58% (65% for low-risk patients and 30% for high-risk patients). These results are similar to those of other centres. There is a need for better methods to prevent early mortality from complications and to prevent relapse of the bone marrow disorder.
