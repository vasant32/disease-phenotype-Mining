In a Phase I/II clinical trial, 13 higher risk red blood cell-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients unresponsive to hypomethylating therapy were treated with the multikinase inhibitor ON 01910.Na. Responses occurred in all morphologic, prognostic risk and cytogenetic subgroups, including four patients with marrow complete responses among eight with stable disease, associated with good drug tolerance. In a subset of patients, a novel nanoscale immunoassay showed substantially decreased AKT2 phosphorylation in CD34+ marrow cells from patients responding to therapy but not those who progressed on therapy. These data demonstrate encouraging efficacy and drug tolerance with ON 01910.Na treatment of higher risk MDS patients.
