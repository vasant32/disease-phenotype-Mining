INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous manifestations of myelodysplastic syndromes are rare and polymorphous. They can be the direct expression of the hematological disease or represent signs of a vasculitis or a neutrophilic syndrome. Myelodysplastic syndromes progress sometimes toward an acute leukemia. OBSERVATION: A 53-year-old woman suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome presented for several months a cutaneous vasculitis without any histological specificity. In time, such presentation was complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of a cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis and an acute monoblastic leukemia type LMA 4. The disease was rapidly fatal. DISCUSSION: The complication of a myelodysplastic syndrome by concurrent Langerhans cell histiocytosis and acute monoblastic leukemia suggests a pathogenic relationship between these two latter disorders.
