A 55 year-old-female with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) underwent hemi-colectomy. We planned to avoid the use of nitrous oxide, because of its myelo suppressive effects. Therefore, we maintained the anesthesia with propofol combined with epidural anesthesia. After the surgical operation, the patient developed no hematological complications.
