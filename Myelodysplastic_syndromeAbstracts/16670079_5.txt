Using flow cytometry, we investigated the clinical and hematologic relevance of expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP) HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110 in bone marrow of 142 patients with newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes, together with that of the membrane differentiation antigen CD34 and the drug-resistance related protein, P170 (Pgp).
