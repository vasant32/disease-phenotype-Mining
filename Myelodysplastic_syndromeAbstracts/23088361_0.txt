 UNLABELLED: BACKGROUD/AIMS: To report two rare cases of orbital myeloid sarcoma in adults and discuss special features relevant to this entity. METHODS: Complete ophthalmologic and systemic examinations followed by incisional biopsy and pathological examination. RESULTS: Two cases of myeloid sarcoma with orbital involvement were identified. Both cases presented with a clinical picture and imaging which demonstrated infiltrative orbital masses. When combined with 8 previous reported cases, 8/10 demonstrated systemic AML involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital myeloid sarcoma is a rare entity in adults and highly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes, especially acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It may present at any stage of AML and requires appropriate workup and treatment, though generally carries a poor prognosis.
