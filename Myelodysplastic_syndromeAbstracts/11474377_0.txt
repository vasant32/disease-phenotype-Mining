The RS3PE syndrome or subacute edematous polyarthritis of the elderly remains a doubtful entity. We report three cases that exhibited different courses: complete recovery, definite rheumatoid polyarthritis, and chronicity as a sign of myelodysplasic disease. These three different courses raise the question of whether RS3PE is a disease or a syndrome. Actually, the use of the term RS3PE syndrome should be restricted to cases with a favorable outcome. Definitive diagnosis thus cannot be reached before complete recovery.
