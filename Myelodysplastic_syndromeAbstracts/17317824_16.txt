 PURPOSE: To investigate the function and expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in bone marrow cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and to examine their involvement in the apoptotic phenomenon characterizing MDS hematopoiesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TLR mRNA and protein expression was investigated in bone marrow cell populations of MDS patients and controls. TLR-4 ability to recognize lipopolysaccharide and up-regulate self mRNA and protein expression was examined. Tumor necrosis factor involvement in the constitutive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR expression was also evaluated. Possible correlation between TLR-4 overexpression and apoptosis was investigated by simultaneous staining with Annexin V and TLR-4. RESULTS: TLR-2 and TLR-4 are expressed in almost all bone marrow cell lineages including megakaryocytes, erythroid cells, myeloid precursors, monocytes, and B lymphocytes and are up-regulated in MDS patients compared with controls. In hematopoietic CD34(+) cells, TLR-4 is also expressed and significantly up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. Treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody reduces both constitutive and LPS-induced TLR-4 levels. Increased TLR-4 expression correlates with increased apoptosis as TLR-4 is almost exclusively found in apoptotic bone marrow mononuclear and CD34(+) cells. The addition of the TLR-4 ligand LPS further enhances the apoptosis of these cells. CONCLUSIONS: TLR-4 and other TLRs are significantly up-regulated in MDS patients whereas TLR-4 is involved in promoting apoptosis, possibly contributing to MDS cytopenia.
