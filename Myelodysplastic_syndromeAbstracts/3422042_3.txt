A case of pancytopenia with dysplastic changes in the bone marrow with trisomy 11 (+11) as the sole karyotypic anomaly in an adult male is described. The literature on +11, both as a primary (14 cases) and secondary (55 cases) cytogenetic event in hematologic disorders, is summarized and the findings are discussed. There is the possibility that +11 is a nonrandom chromosomal anomaly in some myelodysplastic disorders.
