Structural rearrangements in the long arm of chromosome 3, del(3)(q12q25) and t(3;5)(q21-25;q31-33), were observed in bone marrow cells from 2 patients with myeloid neoplastic disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia) and acute febrile neutrophil dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome). 3 of the 4 patients with leukaemia-associated Sweet's syndrome and acquired chromosome abnormalities known from the literature also had 3q changes, in 2 involving band 3q21.
