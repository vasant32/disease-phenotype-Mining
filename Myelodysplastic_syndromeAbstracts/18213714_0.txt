We present the cases of two patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) who both developed generalized adenopathy. Although both had recent histories that placed infection high on the differential of causes for the adenopathy, biopsies demonstrated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as the etiology. The risk of malignant transformation in SCN is known to be significantly elevated, and these cases illustrate the need for physicians of such patients to keep myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML high on the differential when patients manifest atypical symptoms.
