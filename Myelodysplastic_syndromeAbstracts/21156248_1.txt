Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the t(6;9) (p22;q34) is a rare but defined subset with a poor prognosis. We report 16 patients with the t(6;9), of whom 13 had AML, 2 had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 1 had chronic myeloid leukemia in myeloid blast crisis (CML-BC). All except for one were evaluated at diagnosis. The median age was 34.5 (range: 7-62 years), with 12 adults and 12 males. Trilineage dysplasia was present in 13 (81%). Marrow basophilia was seen in only two patients, one of whom had CML-BC. HLA-DR was positive in all 12 patients assessed, CD33 in 11, CD13 in 10, and CD34 in seven. Four patients had one other abnormality apart from the t(6;9). These were the t(9;22) in the patient with CML and deletion 9q, addition 13q, and an isochromosome 8q in the other three patients. There were no complex karyotypes. Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3--internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations were seen in seven of 13 patients. Follow-up details were available for six patients. Three received palliative care, and follow-up details were not available for the other seven. The response to chemotherapy was poor in the remaining patients. The only patients who survived were three out of the four who had allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
