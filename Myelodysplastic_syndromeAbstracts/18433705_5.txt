Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a heterogeneous disease balanced between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). We used flow cytometry to describe and compare the immunophenotypic profile of 20 patients with CMML, 38 patients with MDS, and 20 patients with MPD. CMML and MDS only showed statistically significant differences (P<0.05) in CD56 monocyte expression. CMML and MPD showed significant differences in CD45 myeloid distribution, myeloid antigenic profile, CD56 and CD2 monocyte expression, and B-cell development. These data support the classic concept of CMML as part of MDS diseases and encourage including immunophenotyping among the studies to be performed in these diseases.
