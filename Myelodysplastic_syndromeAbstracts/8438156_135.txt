One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in human leukemia and myelodysplasia is an interstitial deletion within chromosome 5q. A tumor suppressor gene has been hypothesized to lie in 5q31, the smallest commonly deleted region. IRF-1, a gene whose product manifests anti-oncogenic activity, was mapped to 5q31.1. IRF-1 lies between IL-5 and CDC25C and is centromeric to IL-3 and GM-CSF. Among these genes, only IRF-1 was consistently deleted at one or both alleles in 13 cases of leukemia or myelodysplasia with aberrations of 5q31. Inactivating rearrangements of one IRF-1 allele, accompanied by deletion of the second allele, were also identified in one case of acute leukemia. Thus, IRF-1 may be a critically deleted gene in human leukemia and myelodysplasia.
