Cytogenetic studies were performed in 112 untreated cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) between 1985 and 1990. Among 112 patients who were examined at the time of diagnosis, 54 had an abnormal karyotype (48%). The highest frequency of chromosome abnormalities was observed in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and the lowest in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Numerical changes were observed in 19 cases and structural in 17; chromosome 8 was most frequently gained (11 cases), whereas chromosome 7 was most frequently lost (6 cases), 5q- in 14 (4 as a sole anomaly); involvement of 7q22 was seen in 3 cases, 11p in 2 patients, 11q in 3 (one patient as a sole anomaly), 12p in 4 (2 patients as a sole anomaly), i(17q) in 4 (3 patients as a sole anomaly), and complex chromosomal defects in 10 patients. If one takes into account the prognosis value, a complex karyotype and the presence of ring chromosomes were correlated with the worst prognosis, followed by -7/7q-; an intermediate prognosis corresponds to i(17q), 12p as a sole anomaly, +8 (as a sole anomaly or plus other anomalies), and involvement of 12p. Patients with a 5q- as a sole anomaly or with a normal karyotype, had the best prognosis.
