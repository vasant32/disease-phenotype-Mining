Acquired interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 occur frequently in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently IRF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, has been shown to be deleted from the 5q- chromosome in a group of patients with MDS and AML. It has been suggested that the loss of IRF1 may be critical to the development of the 5q- syndrome. We have investigated the allelic loss of IRF1 in a group of 12 patients with MDS and a 5q deletion and 2 patients with AML and a 5q deletion. Gene dosage experiments demonstrated that 12 of 14 patients had loss of one allele of the IRF1 gene but no evidence of homozygous loss and that 2 patients with 5q- syndrome retained both copies of the gene. The retention of IRF1 on the 5q- chromosome in these two cases has been confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization localization using an IRF1 cosmid. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to determine whether there was any evidence for structural rearrangement in the region encompassing the IRF1 gene in these two patients. No aberrant bands were detected with a range of rare cutter enzyme digests. We conclude that IRF1 maps outside the commonly deleted segment of the 5q- chromosome and that loss of IRF1 is not solely responsible for the development of the 5q- syndrome.
