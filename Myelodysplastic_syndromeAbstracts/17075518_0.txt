Granulocytic sarcoma rarely involves the orbit. It is the local proliferation of immature myeloid cells and occurs most often in patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes. We report a case of granulocytic sarcoma that revealed acute myeloid leukemia in a patient suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. At the time of diagnosis, the lesion involved the nasal fossae, the ethmoidal sinus, and the orbit, with subperiosteal tumoral infiltration toward the skin. The treatment involved surgery and radiotherapy. The patient died 3 months later of complications of the hematological disease. This observation is original for the occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma during chronic and well-known leukemia, the age of onset, and the fatal outcome in just a few weeks. In this observation, the ophthalmologist revealed the acute nature of the myelodysplastic syndrome.
