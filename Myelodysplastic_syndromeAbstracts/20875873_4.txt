During a 15-year period, 161 adult patients were diagnosed with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) in the region of Southern Denmark. In 73 patients, the AML diagnosis was preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML), in 31 patients by an antecedent hematologic disease, and in 57 patients by treatment with chemotherapy and/or irradiation (t-AML). Cytogenetic analysis was carried out in 93%, of which 61% had clonal chromosome aberrations. MDS-AML correlated to a normal karyotype (P < 0.001). t-AML correlated to abnormal clones with numerical and structural aberrations (P = 0.03), five or more unrelated aberrations (P = 0.03), marker chromosomes (P = 0.006), abnormal mitoses only (P = 0.01), female sex (P < 0.001), and -7 (P = 0.006). Centromeric breakage correlated to a complex karyotype (P = 0.01). The frequencies of aberrations in s-AML patients were compared with an age-matched group of de novo AML patients diagnosed in the same area and period. In this comparison, s-AML only correlated to -7 (P = 0.02). In 42 patients, we found that MDS patients with an abnormal karyotype were more likely to show cytogenetic evolution during progression to AML than MDS patients with a normal karyotype (P = 0.01). We conclude that population-based cytogenetic studies of adult s-AML and age- and sex-matched de novo AML show comparable distributions of chromosome abnormalities.
