A 75-year-old woman presented with anemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and lingual tumor, but no constitutional symptoms. The laboratory data showed pancytopenia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. A bone marrow aspirate represented an apparent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) feature, specifically, refractory anemia with excess of blasts. A lymph-node biopsy revealed the disappearance of normal architecture, small arborizing blood vessels, large lymphoid cells with prominent cytoplasm (so-called pale cells) and a clonal proliferation of T-lymphocytes. The patient was diagnosed as having MDS associated with immunoblastic lymphadenopathy (IBL)-like T-cell lymphoma. She was subsequently treated with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisolone for lymphoma which successfully induced a remission of not only the T-cell lymphoma but also the MDS. The case suggested that MDS might be a paraneoplastic complication of IBL-like T-cell lymphoma.
