Intracellular contents and serum levels of neutrophilic granule protein components, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin (LF) and lysozyme (LYZ), were investigated in 30 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), with 59 healthy adult donors as controls. Both neutrophilic MPO and LF decreased significantly, suggesting the transformation of abnormal clones. Both serum levels of LF and LYZ exhibited a considerable fluctuation which may reflect reflect granulopoiesis in the bone marrow. We are of the opinion that measurement of intracellular MPO, LF, LYZ and their serum levels may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of MDS and is proved to be of great clinical significance.
