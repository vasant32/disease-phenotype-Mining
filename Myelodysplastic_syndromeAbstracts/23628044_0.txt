This study was purposed to explore the correlation of chromosome karyotype with dyshaematopoiesis and reticulin in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The data of 202 MDS patients diagnosed and treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively analyzed in term of chromosome karyotype, dyshaematopoiesis and reticulin detection results. The chromosome karyotypes were categorized according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The results showed that there was a positive correlation between chromosome karyotype grading and number of lineages with dyshaematopoiesis (r = 0.443, P < 0.05). The detected rates of multilineage dyshaematopoiesis in patients with good, intermediate and poor chromosome karyotypes were 44.4%, 71.4% and 96.3% respectively. There was a positive correlation between chromosome karyotype grading and reticulin grading (r = 0.451, P < 0.05). The positive rates of reticulin in patients with good grading, intermediate and poor chromosome karyotypes were 36.8%, 64.3% and 92.6% respectively. The detected rate of multilineage dyshaematopoiesis, number of lineages with dyshaematopoiesis, the positive rate of reticulin and reticulin grade in patients with poor karyotypes were higher than those in patients with intermediate or good chromosome karyotypes (seperately P < 0.01). The above data in patients with intermediate chromosome karyotypes were higher than those in patients with good chromosome karyotypes (seperately P < 0.01). It is concluded that the chromosome karyotype grading positively correlates with the number of lineages with dyshaematopoiesis and reticulin grading. When the chromosome karyotype changed from good to poor, the detected rate of multilineage dyshaematopoiesis, number of lineages with dyshaematopoiesis, positive rate of reticulin and reticulin grading became higher and higher.
