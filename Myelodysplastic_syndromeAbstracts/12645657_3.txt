We report a t(6;8)(q15;q22) in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with erythroid hypoplasia. The patient was successfully treated with an immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin A, while the translocation was repeatedly detected as the sole anomaly with the percentages of positive cells ranging from 5% to 70%. To our knowledge, the t(6:8) has never been described in MDS.
