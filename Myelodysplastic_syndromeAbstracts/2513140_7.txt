A total of 13 patients receiving bone marrow transplants (BMT) for treatment of different haematological diseases were investigated. Conditioning therapy preceding BMT consisted of fractionated total-body irradiation (12 Gy) and high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (2 +/- 60 mg/kg). Patients stratified to be at high risk for relapse (6/13) were additionally treated with etoposide (30 mg/kg). Plasma concentrations of absolute and lipid-standardized antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene) decreased following conditioning therapy, presumably as the result of an enhanced breakdown of these antioxidants. Etoposide treatment did not amplify the loss of essential anti-oxidants but significantly increased lipid hydroperoxide concentrations in serum. We suggest that the abnormal generation of lipid hydroperoxides is the result of free radical formation.
