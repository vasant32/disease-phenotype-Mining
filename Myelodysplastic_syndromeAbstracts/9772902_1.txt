The q31-q33 region of chromosome 5 includes a number of genes encoding growth factors, growth factor receptors, and hormone/neurotransmitter receptors. The human fibroblast growth factor 1 locus (FGF1) resides in this region of chromosome 5, which is frequently lost in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Other disease loci, including the loci for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and an autosomal dominant deafness, have been mapped on this region, but their genes have not been isolated. It was shown that the critical region lost in two patients with the 5q- syndrome resides between FGF1 and IL12B. We previously reported the construction of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning 330 kb around the FGF1 gene. Here we report the isolation of additional YAC clones that extend 290 kb from the previous contig. Sequence-tagged sites developed from the outermost YAC ends were utilized in the contig cloning of two P1 clones P1Y2 and P1Y8. Together, these YAC and P1 clones span 720 kb around the FGF1 locus. With the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization, a physical map has been constructed of these P1 and GRL (glucocorticoid receptor locus) probes on metaphase and interphase chromosomes. On the basis of our work and the known orientation of GRL transcription, the determined order of these loci on chromosome 5q31.3-q32 is centromere-P1Y8-3'[FGF1]5'-P1Y2-5'[GRL]3'-telome re. Knowing the transcriptional orientation of the FGF1 gene relative to the centromere will now facilitate the directional cloning of clinically important genes that may reside in this region.
