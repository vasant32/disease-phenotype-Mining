A ferrokinetic study was performed in 79 patients, 25 with absolute polycythaemia, 19 with relative polycythaemia and 35 presenting anaemia of different aetiology. The incorporation of transferrin into the erythron (ITE) was estimated on each case. The mean ITE values found in absolute primary and secondary polycythaemia and in secondary polycythaemia were, respectively, 281 +/- 85, 181 +/- 99 and 74 +/- 19 mumol/L tb/d (i.e., micromoles per litre of total blood per day). The mean ITE in iron deficiency anaemia was 110 +/- 43 mumol/L tb/d, in haemolytic anaemia this was 274 +/- 151 mumol/L tb/d, and in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes such values was 116 +/- 49 mumol/L tb/d. Significant differences were found for each group of patients with respect to a normal control group. Such findings are in accordance with the pathophysiology of the different pathologies studied. The values found in haemolytic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes are similar to those reported by others. The results of this study stress the advantages of evaluating the erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow by means of the ITE.
