Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may develop de novo or secondarily to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the clinical outcome of MDS-related AML is worse than that of de novo AML, it is not easy to differentiate between these two clinical courses without a record of prior MDS. Large-scale profiling of gene expression by DNA microarray analysis is a promising approach with which to identify molecular markers specific to de novo or MDS-related AML. This approach has now been adopted with AC133-positive hematopoietic stem cell-like fractions purified from 10 individuals, each with either de novo or MDS-related AML of the M2 subtype. Sets of genes whose activity was associated with either disease course were identified. Furthermore, on the basis of the expression profiles of these genes, it was possible to predict correctly the clinical diagnosis for 17 (85%) of the 20 cases in a cross-validation trial. Similarly, different sets of genes were identified whose expression level was associated with clinical outcome after induction chemotherapy. These data suggest that, at least in terms of gene expression profiles, de novo AML and MDS-related AML are distinct clinical entities.
