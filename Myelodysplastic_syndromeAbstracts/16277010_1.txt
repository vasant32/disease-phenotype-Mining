Acquired clonal chromosomal abnormalities are found in about 30-50% of primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These abnormalities are predominantly characterized by total/partial chromosomal losses or gains and rarely by balanced structural aberrations. Trisomy 8 represents the most common chromosomal gain. In the present study, the numerical aberration of chromosome 8 was evaluated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique in MDS, and the results compared with those of conventional cytogenetics. Thirty adult patients with primary MDS, 17 with a normal karyotype and 13 with several chromosomal abnormalities except chromosome 8, were included in this study. On comparing the results of FISH and conventional cytogenetics, a superiority of FISH over the karyotype was detected in 3 cases. In one of them, further cytogenetic analysis confirmed the FISH results. Nevertheless, the FISH technique has limitations, detecting only abnormalities specific for the target FISH probe used In clinical practice, conventional cytogenetics continues to be the basic technique for MDS patient evaluation. However, a large number of metaphases, even those of poor quality, must be analyzed in each case. The FISH technique could be considered to be complementary to achieve a more accurate analysis.
