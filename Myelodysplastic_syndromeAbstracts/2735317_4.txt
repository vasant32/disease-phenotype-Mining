A 52-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who had a prior history of polycythemia vera is reported. Chromosome analysis revealed that the bone marrow and blood cells at the MDS phase contained trisomy of chromosome 11 as the sole cytogenetic change. Trisomy 11 is rarely found in hematologic neoplasia, and all of the reported cases with trisomy 11 were diagnosed as having nonlymphocytic neoplasia. In this report, a correlation between the chromosome change and leukemia/MDS developed in polycythemia vera is discussed.
