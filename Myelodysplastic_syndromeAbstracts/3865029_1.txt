Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to myelodysplastic phase respond poorly to standard chemotherapy designed for AML. As arabinosyl cytosine (Ara-C) at low-dose has been reported to achieve promising results in certain forms of AML, we have applied the low-dose (10 mg m-2/12 h subcutaneously for 14-24 days) regimen in 11 patients with AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes. Though a complete remission could be achieved in 2 patients and a short partial remission in 2 further patients, complications are severe and often life threatening. The amount of hematological supportive care required often exceeded that needed for patients treated by conventional TAD regimen. Moreover, survival of the responders did not seem to be longer than that of non-responders. A review of the literature showed that the results of this low-dose Ara-C regimen might be more promising in patients in the myelodysplastic phase and in those with de novo acute leukemia.
