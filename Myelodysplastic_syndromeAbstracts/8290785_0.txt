The aim of the present study was to evaluate some functions of neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs), such as aggregation, superoxide production, chemotaxis and adhesion molecules involved in these processes, in 22 patients suffering from Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), to clarify if granulocytes alterations described in this syndrome is really correlated with the expression of surface membrane integrins. Several patients suffering from MDS present granulocytopenia and/or absolute monocytoses; neutrophil granulocytes can have typical nuclear and cytoplasmatic alterations. These granulocytic anomalies are valuable in about 90% of patients suffering from MDS. The granulocytes showed a significant deficit in chemotaxis stimulated by serum activated with E. Coli, casein and formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP) (p < 0.01) and in superoxide production stimulated by phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). We also studied the role of membrane integrin CD11/CD18 using specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). The cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated a significant inhibition in expression of CD11b/CD18 receptors in patients suffering from MDS (p < 0.001), while the expression of CD11a/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 receptors was normal. In conclusion we found specific alterations in PMNs functions in MDS and a correlation of these anomalies with membrane integrins of PMNs is therefore possible.
