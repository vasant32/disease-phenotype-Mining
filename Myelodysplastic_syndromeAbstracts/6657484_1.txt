A registry of malignant haematological diseases was established on January 1st 1980 in order to assess the incidence and epidemiologic features of these diseases in the department of Côte-d'Or (population 470 000). Information was collected from various sources (public or private laboratories, public or private hospitals and death certificates). During the course of two years (1980 and 1981) 194 news cases were recorded. This registry collects acute leukaemia, lymphoid and myeloid proliferative diseases, lymphomas in leukaemic phase and myelodysplastic syndromes. The crude incidence rates were 25.0/100,000 in men and 16.1/100,000 in women. Sex ratio : 1.5. Compared to other French population based registries the incidence is higher in Côte-d'Or, showing the value of specialised registries. The rates are similar to those reported in Geneva and Connecticut.
