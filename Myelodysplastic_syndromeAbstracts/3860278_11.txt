Seven patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome or "smoldering" acute myelogenous leukemia were treated with cytosine arabinoside in low dosage. Four patients experienced transient, partial responses characterized by improved peripheral blood counts, cessation of transfusion requirements, and a decreased incidence of infection. Treatment was associated with significant, transient hematologic toxicity. The appropriate clinical role of low-dose cytosine arabinoside remains uncertain.
