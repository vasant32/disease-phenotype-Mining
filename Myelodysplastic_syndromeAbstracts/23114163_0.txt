Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic malignancies characterized by peripheral cytopenia and dysplastic bone marrow that arise from mutations in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). Recently, significant effects have been made to develop appropriate mouse models to study this complex disease. Three general approaches have been used to establish the MDS mouse, including treatment with mutagens or carcinogene, xenotransplantation of human MDS cells, and genetic engineering of mouse hematopoietic cells. In this review, several MDS mouse models and the advances of study on the mechanisms of malignant clone and the marrow microenvironment are summarized. In addition, the progress in xenotransplantation models of MDS and the problems to be solved are discussed briefly.
