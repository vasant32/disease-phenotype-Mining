A new myeloid leukemia cell line (CG-SH) with normal cytogenetics was established from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) following myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The cells of CG-SH are immature blasts and have an immature myeloid phenotype (positive for myeloperoxidase, CD7, CD34, CD38, CD117, HLA-DR, negative for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD41, CD42). A partial expression of CD13, CD15, CD65 and a weak expression of CD33 and CD133 was noted. The cells are negative for EBER. By molecular analysis, a mutation of NRAS and heterozygous mutations of RUNX1 were detected. No mutations were detected in FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD or NPM1. By real-time PCR, a series of 19 microRNAs was identified which are strongly expressed in CG-SH. In conclusion, a new cell line was established which will be useful for the study of AML with normal cytogenetics and mutations in NRAS and/or RUNX1.
