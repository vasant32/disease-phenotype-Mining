We report an adult case of reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS) associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received emergency bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Despite methylprednisolone pulse therapy, high-dose gamma-globulin, and chemotherapy containing etoposide, the pancytopenia progressed. After informed consent, the patient underwent syngeneic BMT using melphalan as the conditioning regimen. The patient has been well without relapse of RHS and MDS for more than 2 years after BMT. This result suggests that the above strategy, including BMT, should be considered for the treatment of adult RHS associated with hematological malignancy.
