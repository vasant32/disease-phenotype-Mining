We studied mRNA expression of the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8 and stem cell factor of stromal cells derived from bone marrows of nine normal volunteers, eight patients with aplastic anaemia (AA) and seven patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The proportion of endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblast-like cells and adipocytes in stromal cells showed no differences between normal volunteers and the patients. Levels of cytokine mRNA expression were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Spontaneous expression occurred and this was augmented by LPS stimulation in cells of all the normal volunteers and in most patients. When stimulated by LPS, the mean G-CSF and IL-1 beta mRNA expressions in patients with AA were significantly higher than normal volunteers, but there was one patient showing lower IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 expression with no response to LPS. LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression of two patients with MDS were significantly higher than normal. The spontaneous and LPS-induced protein concentration of G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 in culture supernatants from 15, 10 and four patients, correlated well with the mRNA expression. The correlation coefficients were 0 x 92, 0 x 78 and 0 x 91, respectively. In conclusion, there were a few patients whose aetiology appeared to be reduction of stromal cytokine expression in AA, but most patients with AA and MDS expressed normal or high levels of cytokine mRNA.
