Hodgkin's disease (HD) has been linked to an increase risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMN), especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL). The mutagenic property of cytotoxic therapy as well as defective immunity have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of SMN in patients previously treated for HD. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl with HD who developed two different second malignancies within a latent period of 28 months following HD diagnosis. The patient presented initially with bilateral cervical and supraclavicular as well as mediastinal and paraaortic lymphadenopathy. She was staged as IIIA, nodular sclerosing type HD, and was given eight alternative cycles of MOPP-ABVD followed by "mantle" field radiotherapy to a total dose of 3.3 Gy plus 0.4 Gy to the upper mediastinum. Within 8 months following the completion of therapy, a period of myelodysplasia and progressive severe immune deficiency, considered as a result of initial treatment, occurred. Eighteen months after HD diagnosis while the patient was continuously neutropenic and heavily immunocompromised, a peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion type (AIL) Grade III, appeared in both lungs within and beyond the radiation field, with no evidence of HD in biopsy specimens. After institution of a new chemotherapy regimen (L17M), a satisfactory response regarding NHL lesions was noted. However, 10 months later the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) accompanied by complex chromosomal abnormalities evoluted to frank ANLL with a rapid fatal course. This case supports the hypothesis that combined modality treatment accompanied by severe immunodeficiency may result in the development of multiple second malignancies even within a very short latent period, especially in a subgroup of HD patients who may be particularly increased risk of second cancers.
