OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present analysis was the evaluation of clinical conditions and product-specific parameters influencing posttransfusion platelet increment. DESIGN: 400 single-donor platelet transfusions were analyzed for patient- and concentrate-specific factors influencing posttransfusion platelet increment. Statistical analysis was performed by the General Mixed Model Analysis of Variance. SETTING: Department of hematology and oncology at a university hospital. PATIENTS: 46 patients (24 male, 22 female; age 17-80 years). INTERVENTIONS: Single-donor platelet transfusions. RESULTS: As demonstrated earlier, splenomegaly, body temperature, and bone marrow transplantation could be proven as factors reducing posttransfusion platelet increment. In addition, hepatomegaly and application of antibiotics had negative effects on platelet increment. Among the product-specific parameters leukocyte contamination and pretransfusion storage time reduced transfusion success significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors influencing posttransfusion platelet increment can hardly be controlled. In contrast, concentrate-specific parameters can be influenced by preparation technique and storage procedure. Therefore, high value should be set on low leukocyte contamination and short pretransfusion storage time of platelet concentrates.
