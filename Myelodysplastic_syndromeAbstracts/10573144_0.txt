A case with myelodysplasia in which a single clone contained both 5q- and Ph chromosomes at diagnosis is presented. The patient subsequently developed leukocytosis and at that time was found to have acquired an additional chromosomal abnormality, i(17)(q10). This case illustrates the role of three different genetic changes that impart different clinical characteristics, i.e. myelodysplastic as well as myeloproliferative changes, as part of a multistep leukemogenic process.
