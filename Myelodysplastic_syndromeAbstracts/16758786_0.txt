Erythroid hypoplasia in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) happens to be a rare association and is being recognized as a distinct clinico pathological entity. We report here two such cases diagnosed as Refractory anaemia (RA) and Refractory anaemia with excess blast (RAEB) who had marked suppression of the erythroid cell lines. Both patients presented with severe transfusion dependent anaemia. Recognition of these cases is important as alternative modalities of treatment such as immunosuppressives may be considered for these patients.
