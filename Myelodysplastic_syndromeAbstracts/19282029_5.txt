Although unexplained anemia is common in the elderly, the prevalence of MDS is poorly defined. We reviewed 2267 bone marrows reviewed at our center between the years 2002 and 2005. Of these, 322 met our criteria for inclusion (14%). Seventy-three patients (22.6%) had a confirmed diagnosis of MDS and 32 (9.9%) had suspected MDS. Confirmed or suspected MDS was more likely in patients aged >65 (31.5% and 11%, respectively). Age, MCV, LDH and RDW were independently predictive of MDS. Extrapolation of our findings to the elderly anemic individuals in the community suggests MDS prevalence may be higher than previously postulated.
