Eight patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome showed a structural rearrangement of the short arm of chromosome #6 involving the distal segment 6p22----6pter. In four cases the myelodysplastic disorder appeared after treatment with chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Cytogenetically, the 6p anomaly was consistently associated with abnormalities of chromosome #5 and/or #7 in seven of eight cases. We believe we identified a new site on 6p that is nonrandomly involved in iatrogenically and possibly also environmentally induced malignant hematologic disorders.
