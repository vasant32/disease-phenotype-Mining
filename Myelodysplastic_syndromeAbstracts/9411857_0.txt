Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is an acute form of anaemia characterized by a transient red blood cell aplasia, of unknown cause, in the bone marrow. The incidence appears to be increasing. 16 patients were seen in our paediatric department during the period 1990 to 1996. The ages varied from two to 48 months. All patients had severe anaemia, the lowest mean haemoglobin values being 4.9 (2.2-7.8) g/100 ml. The reticulocyte count was low in 14 patients, whereas two patients had reticulocytosis. No underlying haematologic diseases were found. Ten patients were tested for parvovirus B19 infection, all of whom were serologically negative. Apart from transfusion of red blood cells in six patients, no therapy was given. Reticulocytosis, indicating beginning recovery, was observed after a mean interval of 11.8 days. This article gives a short overview of transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, a form of anaemia which can initially represent a diagnostic challenge.
