Ineffective hematopoiesis with associated cytopenias and potential evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterize patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We evaluated levels of apoptosis and of apoptosis-related oncoproteins (c-Myc, which enhances, and Bcl-2, which diminishes apoptosis) expressed within CD34+ and CD34- marrow cell populations of MDS patients (n = 24) to determine their potential roles in the abnormal hematopoiesis of this disorder. Marrow cells were permeabilized and CD34+ and CD34- cells were separately analyzed by FACS to detect: (1) a subdiploid (sub-G1) DNA population, and (2) expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoproteins. Within the CD34+ subset, a significantly increased percentage of cells demonstrated apoptotic/sub-G1 DNA content in early (ie. refractory anemia) MDS patients compared with normal individuals and AML patients (mean values: 9.1% > 2.1% > 1.2%). Correlated with these findings, the ratio of expression of c-Myc to Bcl-2 oncoproteins among CD34+ cells was significantly increased for MDS patients compared to those from normal and AML individuals (mean values: 1.6 > 1.2 > 0.9). Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoprotein levels were maturation stage-dependent, with high levels expressed within CD34+ marrow cells, decreasing markedly with myeloid maturation. Treatment of seven MDS patients with the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus erythropoietin was associated with decreased levels of apoptosis within CD34+ marrow cells and may contribute to the enhanced hematopoiesis in vivo that was shown. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered balance between cell-death (eg, c-Myc) and cell-survival (eg, Bcl-2) programs were associated with the increased degrees of apoptosis present in MDS hematopoietic precursors and may contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis in this disorder, in contrast to decreased apoptosis and enhanced leukemic cell survival in AML.
