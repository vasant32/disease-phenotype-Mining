The bone marrow of a patient with pancytopenia showed dyserythropoiesis, dysmegakaryocytopoiesis and 13% blasts. The patient was hypertransfused and the pancytopenia resolved completely for 1 month, while the blastic infiltration in the bone marrow remained. Three months later a frank acute lymphoblastic leukaemia developed.
