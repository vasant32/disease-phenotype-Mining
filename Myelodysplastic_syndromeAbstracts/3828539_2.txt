Two independent observers performed a double review of cytological and histological bone marrow material obtained at diagnosis and during follow up in 34 patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), subtypes refractory anaemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RA-S) (26 and 8 patients, respectively). Average values were used for the analyses. Data obtained at diagnosis confirmed earlier observations that a worse prognosis was indicated by high blast cell counts (P less than 0.01), presence of blast foci and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.08). Data obtained during follow up, in addition, showed that an increased probability of progression to FAB-subtype RA with an excess of blasts was related to both the occurrence of blast foci (P less than 0.05) and the occurrence of new or additional clonal abnormalities (karyotype shift) (P less than 0.01). The relationship between parameters investigated at diagnosis, during follow up, and in the pooled material, points to RA-S being a separate entity having a better prognosis than RA, and further substantiates an earlier observed relationship between blast cell accumulation and the frequency of cytogenetically abnormal metaphases.
