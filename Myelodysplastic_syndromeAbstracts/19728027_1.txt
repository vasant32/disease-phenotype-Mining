We characterized the prevalence, clinical and cytogenetic characteristics and survival of 435 patients diagnosed with de novo MDS in a single laboratory according to WHO criteria, and compared the utility of different scoring systems to predict survival for individual subtypes of MDS. The mean follow-up period was 25.1 (5.5-53.2) months. Our results confirm major differences in the age-distribution and prevalence of individual subtypes of MDS between Asian and Western patients with a median age of 58 years and a predominance of RCMD (69.9%). Survival rates were similar to those reported in the West: the 3-year survival rate for MDS was 46.7% with a median survival time for RCMD of 38 months and RAEB, 10 months. We found that the IPSS and WPSS scoring systems, which are weighted heavily by blast cell count and karyotype, were not independent predictors for survival in RCMD patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a scoring system based on age (> or =60 years), ANC (<1.0 x 10(9)/L), Hb (<90 g/L), number of cytopenias and complex karyotype is a more useful predictor of survival in RCMD.
