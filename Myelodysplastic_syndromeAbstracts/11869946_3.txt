Twelve patients with myelodysplasia were treated with amifostine plus recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) for 6 weeks. A complete erythroid response was obtained in 2/12(16.6%) and a partial response in 4/12 (33.3%). Two of 8 patients with a platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L had a complete response, as did 3/9 with a neutrophil count < 1.5 x 10(9)/L. Compared to rHuEpo or amifostine used as single agents, their combination did not offer substantial advantages.
