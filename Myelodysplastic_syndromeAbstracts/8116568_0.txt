A patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia) with marked and persistent reticulocytosis is presented. A referring diagnosis of hemolytic disease had been made. However, the 51Cr red cell survival was normal (T1/2 24 days). Reticulocyte morphology, red cell creatine content, and in vitro reticulocyte survival studies have suggested that the reticulocytosis arose as a consequence of delayed maturation of the reticulocytes. Two patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and delayed reticulocyte maturation have previously been described; in both patients, however, red cell survival was also shortened. Anemia with reticulocytosis, mimicking hemolytic disease, may be an unusual presentation of myelodysplastic syndrome.
