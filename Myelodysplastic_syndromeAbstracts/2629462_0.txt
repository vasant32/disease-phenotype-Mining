Several aspects of prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes were reviewed with special attention to refractory anemia (RA). The median survivals were 14 months in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 16 months in RAEB, 42 months in RA, and 58 months in RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS). Cumulative leukemia-free rates at 5 years were 31% in RAEB, 80% in RA, and 92% in RARS. The proportion of cases having very low hazards for leukemic transformation or for nonleukemic death was 92% (RARS), 73% (RA), and 26% (RAEB) for leukemic transformation and 23% (RA) and 29% (RAEB) for nonleukemic death. All RARS cases had hazard for nonleukemic death. In RA, the annual mortality rate was about 5 to 11 times higher than that of age-and sex- matched general population up to 6 years. After which no failure was found in RA cases with survival rate of 33% up to 14 years. The relative importance of hazard from leukemic transformation to nonleukemic death in RA was about one half at presentation, but this declined to less than 10% after 10 years.
