Defining the role of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue in the therapeutic algorithm of follicular lymphoma remains a major challenge. In contrast to the acknowledged poor outcome associated with cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation conditioning in heavily pretreated patients, the prognostic impact of the number of previous therapy lines in patients treated with the chemotherapy-only containing regimen, BEAM, is unknown. From 1997 to 2008 80 patients (41 males, 39 females; median age, 51 years; range, 31-67) received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue with BEAM for relapsed follicular lymphoma at our center. Overall survival and time-to-progression were analyzed according to the number of prior treatment lines. The median number of previous treatment lines was three, with 61% of the patients having received more than three lines (including rituximab in 47%). After a median follow-up of 76 months (range, 14-160), three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. The 5-year overall survival rate was 71% and 5-year time-to-progression was 44%. There were no differences in time-to-progression or overall survival according to the number of previous treatment lines or episodes of disease. In conclusion, high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue with BEAM appears to be equally effective in second or third remission of follicular lymphoma.
