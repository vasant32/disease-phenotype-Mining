 BACKGROUND: Therapyrelated mucositis is associated with considerable morbidity. This complication following allogeneic stem cell therapy (alloSCT) is less severe after reduced intense conditioning (RIC); however, even here it may be serious. METHODS: 52 patients (male: n = 35 (67%), female: n = 17 (33%)) at a median age of 62 years (35-73 years) underwent alloSCT after RIC. Conditioning was either total body irradiation (TBI)(2Gy)/±fludarabine (n = 33, 63.5%) or chemotherapy based. Graftversushost disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was carried out with cyclosporine A ± mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). 45 patients (87%) received shortcourse methotrexate (MTX). Mucositis was graded according to the Bearman and the World Health Organisation (WHO) scale. A variety of parameters were correlated with mucositis. RESULTS: The Bearman and WHO scales showed excellent correlation. Mucositis was significantly more severe after chemotherapybased conditioning compared to conditioning with TBI(2Gy)/±fludarabine (p < 0.002) as well as in cases with an increase in creatinine levels above the upper normal value (UNV) on day +1 after SCT (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the severity correlated with time to engraftment of leucocytes (correlation coefficient (cc) = 0.26, p < 0.02) and thrombocytes (cc = 0.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The conditioning regimen and increased creatinine levels at day +1 were identified as factors predicting the severity of mucositis after RICSCT. Creatinine levels on day +1 after SCT may help identify patients at risk for severe mucositis in the further course of transplantation.
