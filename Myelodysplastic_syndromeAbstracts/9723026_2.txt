Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a hematological disorder that occurs primarily in the elderly as an acquired, sporadic disease. Familial cases of MDS are rare. We have identified a kindred with three affected individuals, with early age of onset, suggesting a possible inherited predisposition to this disease. Using a molecular genetic approach, we examined whether bands 5q31 or 7q22 or both, the chromosomal regions most frequently associated with sporadic MDS, are involved in familial expression of MDS in this pedigree. Linkage analysis using polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers demonstrated that neither 5q31 nor 7q22 cosegregated with MDS in this family. There was no history of common environmental or occupational exposure among family members with MDS. In addition, analysis of polymorphisms at two loci [glutathione S-transferase T1 and M1 (GSTT1 and GSTM1)] involved in carcinogen detoxification and associated with cancer susceptibility, including increased risk for MDS, showed no evidence for enhanced sensitivity to environmental carcinogens in affected family members. Taken together, our findings suggest that (1) there is an inherited predisposition to MDS in this kindred; and (2) genes at 5q31 and 7q22, the regions most commonly associated with sporadic MDS, are excluded from a causal role in this family's disease.
