To investigate the efficaciousness of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) combined with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the hematological changes in the blood and bone marrow along with clinical features after treatment with G-CSF and EPO in 15 patients were observed. Patients were subcutaneously injected with G-CSF 300 microg/d for 10 days, then injected with EPO 100 U/(kg x d) for 10 days. The results showed that the obvious improvements in granulocytes of blood were found in 10 patients with MDS, improvements in erythrocytes of blood were observed in 7 patients with MDS. No serious side effects occured is all treated patients. In conclusion, treatment of G-CSF in combination with EPO is effective for patients with MDS.
