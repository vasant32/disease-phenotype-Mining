Acquired elliptocytosis is a red blood cell abnormality occasionally associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A Japanese male with MDS who presented with elliptocytosis had mild anemia and hypercellular bone marrow with three lineage-dysplasia. He was diagnosed with refractory anemia of MDS. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells showed 47,XY,+1,der(1;5)(q10;p10),t(1;5) (p10;q10),del(20)(q11) in 70% of the analyzed cells. Analysis of red blood cell membrane proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed normal electrophoretic patterns with no quantitative abnormalities of each protein. Del(20q) and/or t(1;5)(p10;q10) might be associated with elliptocytosis in this patient.
