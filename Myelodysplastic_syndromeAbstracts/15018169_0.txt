Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a common, life-threatening complication of bone marrow transplantation that frequently involves the gastrointestinal tract. Since symptoms are typically nonspecific, radiologic examination is often performed to reach a diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported radiologic description of a case of rectal involvement as the first manifestation of GVHD. The differential diagnosis of segmental rectal wall thickening in a patient following bone marrow transplantation should include GVHD.
