 OBJECTIVE: To explore the preventative effect of donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the relapsing patients with leukemia after haplotype hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), as well as its therapeutic effect and safety. METHODS: G-CSF was given at 5 - 10 µg×kg(-1)×d(-1) to donor and PBSCs were obtained on day 5 and frozen and allotted for storing. PBSC infusion was given to all the 20 patients on day 90 after HSCT, and the second treatment was given to 4 patients on day 30 after the first infusion. The occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse rate of high risk leukemia and long-term survival were evaluate after PBSC infusion. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients had acute GVHD after PBSC infusion for a median of 25 (12 - 60) months, 4 of them were ≥ degree III. The cumulative incidence rate was 22.9%, and all of them accepted PBSC infusion twice. Thirteen patients had assessable chronic GVHD, 10 of them were restricted, and no one died of it. Nine patients died of relapse of leukemia. The remaining 11 patients survived leukemia free, including 4 with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 4 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1 with lymphoma-leukemia and 2 with myelodysplastic syndrome-AML (MDS-AML). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the disease free survival rate of 2-year was 52.5%. CONCLUSION: The prophylactic donor PBSC infusion mobilizing with G-CSF is effective, safe and feasible for the relapse of leukemia.
