We have previously demonstrated that two prognostic features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), mutant NRAS and over-expressing BCL-2, cooperate physically and functionally in vivo. Screening of MDS patient bone marrow (BM) identified NRAS:BCL-2 co-localization in 64% cases, correlating with percentage BM blasts, apoptotic features and disease status (p<0.0001). Localization of the complex at the plasma membrane or the mitochondria correlated with disease and apoptosis features in MDS patients, whilst caspase-9 mediated mechanism was elucidated in vivo and in vitro. The intensity and localization of the RAS:BCL-2 complex merits further evaluation as a novel biomarker of MDS.
