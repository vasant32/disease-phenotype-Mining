The Hellström-Lindberg score (HLS) (1997) is designed to predict erythroid response to erythropoietin treatment in myelodysplastic patients. In order to test the validity of this scoring system, 58 patients affected by myelodysplastic syndrome, treated with a "standard dose" approach between 2001 and 2010, were analyzed. The response to erythropoietin treatment was evaluated in accordance with the "international working group" (IWG) criteria. Among the patients only two were scored "poor," 12 "intermediate," and 44 "good" (15 of whom were scored "3" and 29 "4"). Although the system was verified as a predictive tool for response to erythropoietin therapy, we noted that of patients scored as "good," those with a numerical score of "4" responded more frequently than did those scored "3", as evaluated under both the 2006- and 2000-IWG ("major response") criteria. The modest response rate in patients scoring "3" did not show a difference in response rate in comparison to the "intermediate" group. The present data suggest that only patients scoring "4" on the scale may show an adequate response to the standard dose erythropoietin therapy, while frontline high-dose therapy should be offered to other patients. A further analysis considering endogenous erythropoietin as a possible determinant of response revealed the optimal cut-off value of 80 mIU/mL, instead of the value of 100 mIU/mL utilized by the HLS.
