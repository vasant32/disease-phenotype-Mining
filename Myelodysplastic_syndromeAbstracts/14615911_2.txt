We report on a 21-year-old man with a mediastinal germ cell tumor (MGCT) who developed a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, RARS) 10 months after the start of successful treatment with cisplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel. A very rare early occurrence of a therapy-related MDS was suspected. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed an aberrant karyotype, showing a deletion in 12p, an isochromosome 5p, as well as gain of an isochromosome 12p. Isochromosome 12p is a specific aberration frequently observed in MGCT. It also was described in patients who developed hematological transformation of a mediastinal germ cell tumor. In this report the association between mediastinal germ cell tumors and hematological malignancies including the possibility of a common genetic origin is discussed.
