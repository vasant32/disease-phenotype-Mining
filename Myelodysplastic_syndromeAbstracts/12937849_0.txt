Effective therapy of myelodysplatic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia originating from myelodysplastic syndrome has remained an unresolved problem. Advanced age of the patients and persistent pancytopenia make the treatment difficult. Despite large number of therapeutic options none of them is satisfactory. Recently palliative treatment with low-dose melphalan has been reported to have certain activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose melphalan in high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia (AML). Twenty three patients were eligible for the study: 8 with MDS and 15 with AML with multilineage dysplasia. All of them received oral melphalan in a daily dose of 2 mg. Median total dose of the drug was 120 mg (40-840 mg). Ten patients responded to the therapy. We observed complete remission (CR) in 4, partial remission (PR) in 3 and stabilization of the disease in 3 patients. Thirteen patients did not respond to the therapy. The survival time of the patients from the day of diagnosis and from the beginning of the treatment with melphalan was longer in patients responding to the therapy (median 15 and 10 months, respectively) than in non-responders (4.5 and 4 months, p=0.003 and p=0.008, respectively). Low-dose melphalan shows significant activity in high-risk MDS and AML with multilineage dysplasia with acceptable toxicity.
