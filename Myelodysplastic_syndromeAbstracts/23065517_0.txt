Myelodysplastic syndromes represent particularly challenging hematologic malignancies that arise from a large spectrum of genetic events resulting in a disease characterized by a range of different presentations and outcomes. Despite efforts to classify and identify the key genetic events, little improvement has been made in therapies that will increase patient survival. Animal models represent powerful tools to model and study human diseases and are useful pre-clinical platforms. In addition to enforced expression of candidate oncogenes, gene inactivation has allowed the consequences of the genetic effects of human myelodysplastic syndrome to be studied in mice. This review aims to examine the animal models expressing myelodysplastic syndrome-associated genes that are currently available and to highlight the most appropriate model to phenocopy myelodysplastic syndrome disease and its risk of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia.
