Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe modality for examining the bone marrow and it is quite effective in revealing marrow involvement in hematological malignancies. MRI has been compared with needle marrow biopsy in 22 patients with myelodysplastic disorders. A fairly good concordance has been demonstrated in 79% of cases. However, in 5 patients MRI revealed that bone marrow hyperplasia was not generalized. Therefore in elderly patients with MDS, MRI of the spine allows the quantification of bone marrow hyperplasia with a greater accuracy than bone marrow biopsy and this may be useful for monitoring the effect of cytostatic treatment.
