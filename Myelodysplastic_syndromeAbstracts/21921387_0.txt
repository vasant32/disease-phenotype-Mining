We report a case of Good's syndrome-associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this case, effector memory T (T(EM)) cells were expanded in the bone marrow. It remains uncertain whether the development of MDS was caused by the basic marrow defects or radiation therapy. However, since CD8(+) perforin(+) T(EM) cells expanded in the bone marrow, as was previously described for 3 of our patients with thymoma-associated PRCA, it is highly possible that the pathogenic mechanism of PRCA that is accompanied by thymoma is related to the expanded CD8(+) perforin(+) T(EM) cells in this MDS-complicated case.
