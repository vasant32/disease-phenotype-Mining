Seventeen consecutively admitted poor risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and 4 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with a remission-induction regimen consisting of a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion of conventional doses of cytarabine and of three 24-h constant rate infusions of daunorubicin administered intermittently on days 1, 3 and 5. The diagnoses were: relapsed primary AML in 6 patients, secondary AML in 11 patients (9 untreated, 2 relapsed) and MDS in 4 patients. The median age was 50 yr. Five of 6 patients with relapsed primary AML, 3 of 11 patients with secondary AML and 2 of 4 patients with MDS achieved complete remission (CR). The overall CR rate was 48% with a median remission duration of 5 months (range: 0.25-20 months). Few acute toxic side effects were observed thanks to the constant rate of infusion of daunorubicin.
