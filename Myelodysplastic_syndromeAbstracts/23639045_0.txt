The effect of lenalidomide on the corrected QT (QTc) interval was evaluated in healthy men and extended to patients based on the lenalidomide concentration-QTc (C-QTc) relationship. A rigorous assessment of the effect of lenalidomide on QTc intervals was conducted in healthy volunteers who each received, in randomized order, a single oral dose of 10 mg lenalidomide, 50 mg lenalidomide, 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control) and placebo. Plasma lenalidomide exposure was compared between healthy volunteers and patients with multiple myeloma or myelodysplastic syndromes. In healthy volunteers, moxifloxacin produced the expected significant prolongation in QTcI (individual correction). For lenalidomide 10 mg and 50 mg, the time-matched changes from placebo in the baseline-adjusted least-squares mean QTcI were <3 ms with the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the change <10 ms at all time points. No subjects experienced QTcI >450 ms or change-from-baseline >60 ms after lenalidomide administration. Similar results were seen with QT interval data corrected by Fridericia and Bazett methods. The C-QTc analysis yielded no significant association between lenalidomide concentrations and QTcI changes up to 1522 ng/mL; this range was close to that observed in patients receiving lenalidomide doses up to 50 mg, including those with reduced drug-clearance due to renal impairment. In conclusion, single doses of lenalidomide up to 50 mg were not associated with prolonged QTc intervals in healthy males. The C-QTc analysis further assured that lenalidomide doses up to 50 mg are not expected to prolong QTc intervals in patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
