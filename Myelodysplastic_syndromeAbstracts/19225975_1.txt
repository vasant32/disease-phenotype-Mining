The TNFR family member 4-1BB and its ligand 4-1BBL are involved in the costimulation of T-cells and tumor-derived soluble (s)4-1BBL may influence the interaction of malignant cells with the immune system. Here, we report that cell-surface-expressed (c)4-1BBL can be expressed on mononuclear blood cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 35), myelodysplasia (n = 5) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 11) and can be coexpressed on varying proportions of lymphoid or myeloid malignant cells and on dendritic cells differentiated from AML-blasts. Direct correlations between c- and s4-1BBL were not found in the investigated cases. Up to now expression of 4-1BBL has not been described on primary myeloid malignant cells, but only on malignant cells of lymphoid or solid tumor origin or on tumor cell lines. With our work we further contribute to the understanding of the potential role of c/s4-1BBL in immune reactions and its influence on the interaction of tumor and immunoreactive cells.
