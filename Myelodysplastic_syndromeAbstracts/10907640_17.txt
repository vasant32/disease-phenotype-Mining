OBJECTIVE: Excessive apoptosis may have a role in the ineffective hematopoiesis and cytopenias observed in myelodysplastic syndromes. The goals of this study were 1) to quantify apoptosis in patients with "early stage" myelodysplasia [including patients with refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts and with less than 10% blasts (RAEB(<10))], and in patients with "late stage" myelodysplasia [including RAEB with more than 10% blasts (RAEB(>10)), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplasia (LAM2)]; 2) to study the activation of the caspase-3/CPP32 enzyme, a major "effector" caspase in hematopoiesis, in patients with "early stage" myelodysplasia, and 3) to evaluate the effect of caspase inhibition on the apoptotic phenotype and clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients: Fifty-four patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, including 30 with "early stage" myelodysplasia and 24 with "late stage" myelodysplasia were studied. Study of apoptosis: TUNEL assay performed on bone marrow smears and/or quantification of annexin V positive bone marrow mononuclear cells by flow cytometric analysis. Caspacse-3/CPP32 activity: Quantitative measurement of caspase-3/CPP32 activity on total bone marrow mononuclear cells using a fluorogenic substrate. Effect of the caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK: 1) on the apoptotic phenotype of total bone marrow mononuclear cells and 2) on the clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. RESULTS: The group of 30 patients with "early stage" myelodysplasia had statistically increased apoptosis compared to the group of 24 patients with "late stage" myelodysplasia (44.1% +/- 4.8 vs 21.8% +/- 3.6; p = 0.02) using the TDT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In the group of patients with RAEB, those with MDS(RAEB<10) had excessive apoptosis compared to those with MDS(RAEB>10) (44.0% +/- 3.5% vs 29.5% +/- 3.6%;p = 0.042) The median caspase-3 activity in 20 "early stage" myelodysplasia patients was 19,000 U (range 3,460-41,000) and significantly increased compared to normal individuals (4,256 U, range 3,200-5,200; p = 0.032) Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 12 "early stage" MDS patients (including 11 from the 20 studied for caspase-3 activity) were incubated with or without the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. In 4 of 9 evaluable patients (44.4%) with excessive apoptosis, the number of annexin V positive cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK. However, in none of these patients was caspase inhibition with Z-VAD-FMK able to enhance colony formation in vitro. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that a major characteristic of patients with "early stage" myelodysplasia is increased apoptosis. The results also indicate that excessive apoptosis in these patients is accompanied by increased caspase-3/CPP32 activity. However, caspase inhibition with the broad-spectrum inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK cannot improve hematopoiesis in this group of patients, even when apoptosis is attenuated.
