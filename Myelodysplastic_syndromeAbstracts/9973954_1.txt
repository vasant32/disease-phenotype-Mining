Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of relatively ill-defined hematopoietic disorders in which both qualitative and quantitative defects of the hematopoietic cells cause bone marrow dysfunction. With an incidence estimated to be approximately 1 per 100,000 persons per year, MDS mainly affects the elderly. Myelodysplastic syndromes share many features with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia; in fact, a proportion of patients with MDS eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia. To illustrate a multimodal approach in the diagnosis of patients with hematopoietic disorders, we describe a 66-year-old patient with a question of myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and two translocations involving chromosome 10:t(5;10) and t(7;10). These structural rearrangements effectively gave rise to monosomy for part of the long arm of chromosome 5 and for the long arm of chromosome 7. Findings of del(5q) and del(7) in MDS have been reported in the literature. The results of chromosome morphometry, which was conducted to compare the lengths of all relevant chromosome segments, are consistent with the hypothesized chromosomal abnormalities. The investigational technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using both painting and alpha-satellite probes, was used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics to further delineate the nature of the chromosome abnormalities observed in the GTG-banded studies. Confirmatory studies utilizing the new technique of spectral karyotyping (SKY) were also carried out. Thus, the multimodal approach of hematopathology, GTG-banding, chromosome morphometry, FISH, and SKY can be very useful for delineating complex cytogenetic cases.
