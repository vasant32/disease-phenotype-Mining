Immunophenotyping of hematologic malignancies represents one of the most relevant clinical applications of flow cytometry. Classically, leukemic/lymphomatous cells have been considered to reflect the immunophenotypic characteristics of different precursors and mature healthy cells blocked at certain differentiation stages. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that neoplastic cells display several aberrant phenotypic patterns. These aberrant phenotypes are believed to reflect genetic abnormalities present in pathologic cells, and recent data have shown that at least in acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, and plasma cell dyscrasias, they may be present in almost all patients. The aim of this work is to review recent advances in flow cytometry and the role of gating strategies more useful in the identification and characterization of neoplastic cells of different hematologic malignancies.
