To assess the effects of GM-CSF in patients with myelodysplasia, a total of 101 patients with refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and RA with an excess of blasts provided that the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow did not exceed 10% (RAEB) were enrolled in the EORTC Leukemia Cooperative Group study 06885. They were randomized to receive two daily subcutaneous injections of rhGM-CSF (mammalian, glycosylated, Sandoz/Schering-Plough) at a daily dose of either 108 micrograms glycoprotein (group I) or 216 micrograms glycoprotein (group II) for 8 weeks. Response was defined as an increase in Hb (greater than 2.5 g%), neutrophil count (more than 100%), or platelet count (more than 100%) without progression of the disease. After exclusion of 19 patients who did not meet the entry criteria, 82 were evaluated. Fifty-four patients (66%) responded (27 of 42 patients in group I and 27 of 40 in group II). Progressive disease was seen in two patients of group I and in four of group II. Two of the latter developed leukemia. All responses were reflected in the granulocytic series. In two patients platelet numbers also increased. Cytogenetic analysis, successfully performed in 43 cases, showed that 14 of 16 patients with normal karyotypes responded, compared with 14 of 27 patients with abnormal karyotypes (p = 0.008). In some cases GM-CSF was reduced in dose or discontinued prematurely due to side effects so that only 35% of all evaluable patients finished 8 weeks of treatment without a change of dose.
