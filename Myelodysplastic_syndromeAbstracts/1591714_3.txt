A case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after radiochemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, with a rearrangement of 6p23 region, is described. This chromosome change, which has been previously reported in secondary leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes, was an isolated karyotypic anomaly in our case, which strongly supports the nonrandom involvement of chromosome 6p in induced leukemias.
