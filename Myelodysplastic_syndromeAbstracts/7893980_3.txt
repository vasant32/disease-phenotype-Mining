After previous serological screening for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) showed elevated antibody titers against EBV and HHV-6 in more than 50% of patients with myelodysplasia and chronic myeloproliferative diseases, the present study was carried out in order to investigate viral antigen expression and distribution in bone marrow cells of these patients. Trephine biopsies were studied from 60 patients with myelodysplasia (MDS), 36 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 18 patients with osteomyelofibrosis (PMF). Elevated anti-EBV EA titers were found in 62% of the MDS cases, in 33% of the CMLs and in 62% of the OMF patients. HHV-6 titers were elevated in 18% of the MDS cases, but in only one case each of CML and OMF. Antigen expression in bone marrow cells was even more frequent: EBV-EA was 76% in MDS cases, 77% in CML and 40% in OMF. HHV-6 p41 was observed in 47% of the MDS cases, in 54% of the CML cases and in 20% of the OMFs. In comparing these data with those from the literature and with our own studies in Hodgkin's disease, it is hypothesized that the reactivated herpesviruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of these hematopoietic disorders by interfering with the cytokine regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.
