JAK2 V617F mutation is mostly seen in BCR-ABLI negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Among other myeloid neoplasms, it occurs with remarkably high frequency in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis, a group of myeloid neoplasms with both dysplastic and proliferative features. It has also been reported in occasional cases of myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q), often with a diagnosis of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. We performed a retrospective analysis of JAK2 V617F mutation in Chinese patients with myeloid neoplasms and isolated del(5q), and were able to demonstrate the frequent occurrence of JAK2 V617F mutation in 5q- syndrome.
