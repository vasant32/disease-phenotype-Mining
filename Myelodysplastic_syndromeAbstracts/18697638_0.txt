We report a rare case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) secondary to erythropoietin (EPO) in an 89-year-old patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The incidence of EPO-induced thrombotic episode increases with an absolute increase of hemoglobin (Hb) beyond >12 gm/dL or rate of increase of Hb level >1 gm/dL every 2 weeks.
