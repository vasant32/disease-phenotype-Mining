Numerous morphologic features have been described in bone marrow and peripheral blood in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We draw attention to a high incidence of a subtle morphologic feature, internuclear bridging (INB), not previously recognized as a morphologic feature in MDS. The occurrence of INB in MDS suggests an underlying abnormality of mitotic division that could explain the impaired production of hematopoietic cells, the addition and deletion cytogenetic changes, and the stepwise disease progression and cytogenetic progression characteristic of MDS. Lack of awareness that INB occurs in MDS may cause confusion of MDS and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I, a congenital process also characterized by INB.
