We investigated the hematologic abnormalities and prognoses in 16 cats with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were observed in 15, 13, and 4, respectively, of the 16 cats with MDS. Morphologic abnormalities characteristic of MDS included megaloblastoid rubricytes (9 cats), hyposegmentation of neutrophils (7 cats), nuclear abnormality of rubricytes (10 cats) and neutrophils (13 cats), and micromegakaryocytes (10 cats). Disease in these 16 cats was subclassified into refractory anemia (RA; 8 cats), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB; 5 cats), RAEB in transformation (RAEB in T; 1 cat), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL; 2 cats), according to the human French-American-British (FAB) classification. In the cats in which the clinical outcome was known, 3 of 6 cats with high blast cell count MDS, including RAEB, RAEB in T, and CMMoL, developed acute myeloid leukemia, but only 1 of 8 cats with low blast cell count MDS (RA) developed acute myeloid leukemia. Based on the Dusseldorf scoring system for the prognosis of human MDS, the survival times of the cats showing high scores (> or =3 points) were significantly shorter than those of the cats with low scores (<3 points). The FAB classification and Dusseldorf scoring system were considered to be useful for predicting the prognosis of feline MDS. Furthermore, 15 of the 16 cats with MDS in this study were infected with feline leukemia virus, indicating its possible etiologic role in the pathogenesis of feline MDS.
