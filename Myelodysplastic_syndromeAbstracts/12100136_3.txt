We evaluated erythrocyte recovery in 121 allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. There were 35 major and minor ABO-incompatible transplants, respectively, including 10 bi-directionally ABO-incompatible transplants. The use of peripheral blood stem cells facilitated erythrocyte recovery, regardless of the presence or absence of major ABO-incompatibility, and was associated with a frequent detection of anti-host isohaemagglutin early after minor ABO-incompatible transplantation, which was not associated with clinically relevant haemolysis. The use of a reduced-intensity regimen combining a purine analogue and busulphan did not delay erythrocyte recovery after major ABO-incompatible transplantation, suggesting this regimen had a strong activity against host plasma cell.
