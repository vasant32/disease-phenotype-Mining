 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of two sequential total body irradiation (TBI) regimens, especially focusing on pulmonary complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with malignant disease who underwent TBI followed by bone marrow transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. There were 86 patients (51 males, 35 females). Altogether, 36 patients were treated on twice-daily fractions of 2 Gy for 3 days to a total 12 Gy (group A). Another 50 patients were treated on once-daily fractions of 2.4 or 3.0 Gy for 4 or 5 days to a total 12 Gy (group B). RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 49.2%, and relapse-free survival was 44.3%. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding overall survival (P = 0.1237) or relapse-free survival (P = 0.1548). Two patients in group A had interstitial pneumonitis of grade 3 or higher severity compared with three patients in group B. There was no significant difference between patients in group A (5-year probability rate was 7.6%) and patients in group B (5-year probability rate was 13.9%) (P = 0.9519). CONCLUSION: We concluded that our once-daily TBI regimen is feasible and had the benefit of reducing the complexity of TBI. We believe that further investigation of the TBI regimen is needed.
