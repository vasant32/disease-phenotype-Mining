The in vivo effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) combined treatment on CD34(+) cells was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 13 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities. After treatment, responsive patients presented a significantly lower proportion of FISH abnormal CD34(+) cells than before treatment (P = 0.003), and in comparison with unresponsive cases (P = 0.007). Response to treatment was associated with a reduced degree of apoptosis in CD34(+) cells (P = 0.021): however, no difference in telomere length was observed in responsive patients after growth factor administration. Although the number of patients analysed was relatively small, the present data suggest that, in MDS patients, response to rHuEpo and G-CSF may be related to the proliferation of karyotypically normal but potentially defective CD34(+) progenitor cells.
