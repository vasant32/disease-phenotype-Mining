Vitamin K(2) (menaquinone-4, MK-4) has been reported to induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome cell lines. The effects of MK-4 on the development of arthritis have never been addressed thus far. In the present study, we investigated the effect of MK-4 upon the proliferation of rheumatoid synovial cells and the development of arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis. We analyzed the effect of MK-4 on the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The pro-apoptotic effect of MK-4 upon fibroblast-like synoviocytes was investigated with annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 assays. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of MK-4 on the development of collagen-induced arthritis in female dark agouti rats. Our results indicated that MK-4 inhibited the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and the development of collagen-induced arthritis in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that MK-4 may represent a new agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the setting of combination therapy with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
