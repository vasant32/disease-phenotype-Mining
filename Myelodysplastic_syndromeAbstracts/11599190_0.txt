INTRODUCTION: Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare skin infection caused by gram negative bacteria. It involves immunocompromised patients, especially neutropenic patients, and can be easily diagnosed. EXEGESIS: We report a case of ecthyma gangrenosum without septicemia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a myelodysplastic patient with severe neutropenia. Granulocyte growth factors adjunction was necessary in combination to antibiotics to obtain complete healing. CONCLUSION: In neutropenic patient, ecthyma gangrenosum due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be rapidly diagnosed to avoid septicemic complications. In the case of antibiotic treatment failure, granulocyte growth factors may be added. Frequent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections justify bacteriologic survey to look for hospital contamination.
