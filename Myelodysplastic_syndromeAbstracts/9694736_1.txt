Chromosome band 12p13 is known as a recurring site for cytogenetic alteration in a variety of hematological malignancies such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).1 Recently, the TEL gene has been shown to be involved in hematological malignancies with 12p13 aberration, most of which exhibit reciprocal translocation between 12p13 and various partner loci, including 3q26, 5q33, 9q34, 21q22, and 22q11. By 12p13 translocation, the TEL gene is disrupted and fused to its partner genes such as PDGFR-,2 ABL,3 and AML-1.4 On the other hand, invesion 12 at p13 is a rare abnormality and only 9 cases (1 AML and 8 MDS) were reported previously.5-8 Whether the TEL gene is involved in this aberration has not been determined. We describe here an additional case of AML with inv(12)(p13q15) in which the rearrangement of the TEL gene was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
