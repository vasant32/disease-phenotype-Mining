Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary infection is usually seen in elderly persons. We encountered a rare case of MAC pulmonary disease seen in a 19-year-old adolescent. The patient had received bone marrow transplantation at the age of 16 for myelodysplastic syndrome. Subsequently, he developed constrictive bronchiolitis and has been treated with corticosteroid and taclorimus. At age 19, small or fine nodules and a cavitary nodule in right lung were detected on the chest radiograph and computed tomography. Afterwards, Mycobacterium avium was detected by bronchoscopic examination and sputum examination and he was diagnosed as MAC pulmonary infection. MAC pulmonary infection in a young person at the age of 19 is an extremely rare case, in which constrictive bronchiolitis, immunosuppression by corticosteroid and tacrolimus, and diabetes mellitus were considered as critical predisposing factors.
