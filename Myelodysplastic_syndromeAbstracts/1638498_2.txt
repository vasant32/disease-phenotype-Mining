The authors describe three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome without a history of exposure to chemical agents and who showed many chromosome rearrangements not previously reported in this hematologic disorder, and a rapid outcome of the disease. The authors discuss the significance of the chromosome changes, suggesting, in agreement with others, that patients with complex rearrangements have a poor prognosis.
