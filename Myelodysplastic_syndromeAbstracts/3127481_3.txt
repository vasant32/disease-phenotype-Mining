A case of iron deposition in the labial accessory salivary glands associated with prominent xerostomy and xerophtalmy is reported. Suffering from a myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anaemia, this patient received multiple transfusions over the past 7 years. A transfusional haemosiderosis gradually developed. Histopathologic examination of accessory salivary glands demonstrated haemosiderin deposition in the serous alveoli and in the epithelial cells of intercalated and interlobular ducts. A relationship between the iron deposition in the salivary glands and the development of the sicca syndrome is suggested. The literature related to iron deposition in salivary glands and sicca syndrome is reviewed.
