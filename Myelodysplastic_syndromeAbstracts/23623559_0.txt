The gold standard of cytogenetic analysis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is conventional chromosome banding (CCB) analysis of bone marrow (BM) metaphases. Most aberrations can also be detected by fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH). For this prospective multicenter German diagnostic study (www.clinicaltrials.gov: #NCT01355913) 360 patients, as yet, were followed up to 3 years by sequential FISH analyses of immunomagnetically enriched CD34+ peripheral blood (PB) cells using comprehensive FISH probe panels, resulting in a total number of 19,516 FISH analyses. We demonstrate that CD34+ PB FISH correlates significantly with CCB analysis and represents a feasible method for a reliable non-invasive cytogenetic monitoring from PB.
