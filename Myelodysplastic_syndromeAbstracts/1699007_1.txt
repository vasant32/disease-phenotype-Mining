A clinical study of rhG-CSF (KRN8601) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed to investigate the hematopoietic effects and the increase of neutrophils. The rhG-CSF was administered daily by intravenous infusion over 30 min. to 21 patients with MDS (PARA = 11, RAEB = 4, RAEB in T = 6). The dose was escalated stepwise from 50 to 400 microgram/m2 every week. Within one week to 26 days after commencement of rhG-CSF administration, the increases of absolute neutrophil counts in peripheral blood were observed in all patients. Treatment with rhG-CSF enhanced normal marrow myeloid cell differentiation and maturation in 3 of 9 PARA patients and in 3 of 4 RAEB patients. None of patients changed to acute leukemia attributable to rhG-CSF, but one of RAEB patient and two of RAEB in T patients progressed to leukemic phase in 21 days or two months after treatment. Minor side effects or abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 3 patients (14.3%). These results suggested that treatment with rhG-CSF was well tolerated and effective for improving the neutropenia between 50 to 400 micrograms/m2 in patients with MDS.
