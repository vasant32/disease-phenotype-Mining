 OBJECTIVES: Some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) show a marked increase in the percentage of immature platelet fraction (IPF%) despite the absence of severe thrombocytopenia. To determine the significance of such an unbalanced increase in the IPF%, we investigated the IPF% and other laboratory findings of 51 patients recently diagnosed with MDS. METHOD: Subjects consisted of 80 healthy males, 90 healthy females, and 51 patients with MDS and 20 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The IPF and IPF% were determined using a Sysmex XE-2100 system loaded with IPF Master software (XE IPF Master, Sysmex). Platelet counts were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: IPF% and platelet counts of these patients ranged from 1.1% to 25.1% (median, 5.3%) and from 6 to 260 x 10(9)/L (median, 71 x 10(9)/L), respectively. Twelve patients showed platelet counts more than 50 x 10(9)/L with 10% or more IPF%. All of the 12 patients had chromosome abnormalities including monosomy 7 and complex abnormalities involving 7 or 5q. In the other 39 patients who did not show the aberrant IPF% increase, chromosomal abnormalities were seen only in seven patients and none of them had chromosome 7 abnormalities. The IPF% of two patients increased to more than 10% in association with the appearance of monosomy 7. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a high IPF% in MDS patient may be a marker for karyotypic abnormalities with a poor prognosis, including chromosome 7 abnormalities.
