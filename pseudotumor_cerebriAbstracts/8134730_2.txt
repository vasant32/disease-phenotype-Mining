We present the case of a 23 years old female with chronic granulocytic leukemia and two intracranial tumors with all the radiological characteristics of intracranial meningiomas. Successful removal of the largest tumor was accomplished using the technique described for meningiomas. The recovery was very good and the histopathologic diagnosis was of granulocytic sarcoma. Radiotherapy of the second tumor reduced the tumor mass within one month leaving the patient neurologically intact. We recommended surgery in the future treatment of large chloromas.
