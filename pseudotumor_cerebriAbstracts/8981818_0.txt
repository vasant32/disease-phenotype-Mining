Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a syndrome characterized by intracranial hypertension and associated with headaches, visual disturbances and papilledema, but without any identifiable intracranial pathology. PTC during pregnancy is uncommon; we report 2 such cases. Neither patient had specific complications associated with PTC. In 1 case, US of the optic nerve was used in the management. Both delivered vaginally and each had a normal puerperium. We conclude that PTC during pregnancy has no adverse effect on outcome.
