During the experimentally induced cerebral oedema and intracranial hypertension the eye fundus changes have been evaluated in generally anaesthetized rats. Cerebral oedema was caused either by means of an osmotic or cryogenic method. Dynamics of the observed ocular changes were indirectly correlated with the origin, development and regression of the cerebral oedema caused by both different etiologic factors.
