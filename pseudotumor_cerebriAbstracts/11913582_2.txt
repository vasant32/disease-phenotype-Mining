An 11-year-old girl presented with headache of 3 months' duration. There was bilateral disc edema. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure was 50 cm of water with normal cerebrospinal fluid cytology and biochemistry. She developed severe headache (different and disabling), dizziness, vomiting, and backache on sitting up 6 hours after lumbar puncture, and lying supine relieved all of her symptoms. Intravenous fluids, analgesics, and complete bed rest did not relieve her symptoms over the next 72 hours. She was completely relieved of her symptoms on receiving two tablets of Caffergot containing 200 mg of caffeine and 2 mg of ergotamine 72 hours after lumbar puncture. The symptoms recurred 48 hours later, and a repeat dose of Caffergot was required. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done 96 hours after lumbar puncture revealed the entire dura overlying the brain, including the posterior fossa, showing intense enhancement on contrast injection with leak at the lumbar puncture site. Oral caffeine (coffee, three times a day) was advised over 1 week. The patient remained asymptomatic, and a repeat MRI scan after 10 days showed complete clearing of the cerebrospinal fluid leak with no dural enhancement. The syndrome of cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia following lumbar puncture is reported in a girl with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
