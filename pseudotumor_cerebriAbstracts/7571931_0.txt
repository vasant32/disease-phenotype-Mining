Eighty patients with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) (76 females, 4 males, age range 15-54 years) were studied. Endocrine changes (pregnancy-17, obesity-16, dysmenorrhea-15, hyperthyroidism-7, etc.) were the most common cause of BIH (72.5%-58 from 80). Besides general sings of intracranial hypertension (papilledema-80, headache-76, nausea-47, dizziness-43, obnubilations-39), 36 (45%) patients had visual problems. After treatment complete recovery took place in 48 patients, non-significant residual changes persisted in 16 patients, main symptoms of BIH persisted in 16 patients. Papilledema regressed completely in 52 patients, post-papilledematous discoloration of optic disks or optic atrophy were discovered in 12 patients.
