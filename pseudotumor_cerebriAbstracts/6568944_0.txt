The triggering mechanisms of diffuse cerebral swelling are poorly understood. The findings in this study are in keeping with the hypothesis that chemicals released by brain trauma into the CSF promote vasodilatation. Other proposals have included brainstem stimulation with increased cerebral blood flow and defective autoregulation. A number of factors may be operative.
