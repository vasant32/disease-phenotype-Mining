It is the primary purpose of this treatise to outline the essential differences between empty sella syndrome (ESS) and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). An attempt is made to determine why these syndromes may coexist. A detailed case report is presented which emphasizes the definitive signs and symptoms that are found in patients having both of these syndromes, and differentiation is made between idiopathic and secondary ESS.
