A 14-year-old secondary school girl presented with acute onset severe generalized headache associated with vomiting and diplopia. These followed an initial fever, which responded to chloroquine. She had been on peflacine for a left knee septic arthritis until onset of her symptoms. The main findings on physical examination were mild obesity, left abducent nerve palsy, bilateral papilledema and evidence of resolving arthritis of her left knee. The results of her investigations, including a brain CT scan were within normal limits. A diagnosis of IIH was made. She responded satisfactorily to oral acetazolamide with complete resolution of her symptoms and signs within 12 days of hospitalization and 2 weeks of follow-up.
