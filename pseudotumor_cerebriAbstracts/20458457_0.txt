We report on a 40-year-old, extremely obese female patient with severe headaches and transitory visual obscurations due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which still remains a dangerous and potentially blinding disease. An immediate and consistent, stage adjusted therapy with medical and/or surgical options is needed to prevent patients from going blind. Lacking compliance is a high risk factor for a severe course of the disease. In case of the occurrence of the typical symptoms and predisposing factors, an idiopathic intracranial hypertension should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
