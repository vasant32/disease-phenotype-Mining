Among 38 children with pseudotumor cerebri only 3 cases were due to ear disease or its complications. The commonest cause was a refeeding syndrome either due to nutritional deprivation or as an early finding in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It is uncommon to find the cause of pseudotumor in older children but in those under 6 years the cause was found in 85%. Because of the adverse effects of steroids we use this treatment in the more resistant cases.
