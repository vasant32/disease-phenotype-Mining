The response of plasma and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin concentration to short-time induced intracranial hypertension was studied in 8 patients with hydrocephalus, defined as ventricular enlargement on computerized tomography. In connection with measurement of conductance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow, the concentration of vasopressin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid was measured during perfusion at a low (less than 10 mmHg) and at a high (greater than 20 mmHg) intraventricular pressure level. Mean plasma vasopressin concentration was increased from 2.4 +/- 0.4 pg/ml (SEM) during perfusion at the low pressure level to 4.2 +/- 0.8 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) at the high pressure level. The cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of vasopressin at the low and high intraventricular pressure were 1.2 +/- 0.1 pg/ml and 1.7 +/- 0.2 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. However, only half of the patients responded to the increase in intraventricular pressure with an increase in cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin concentration exceeding 50%. The results of the present study suggest that an increase in the intracranial pressure might be a stimulus for vasopressin release in both the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid.
