Intracranial hypertension is caused by various pathologic processes. From oncologic point of view, they are 1) intracranial space-occupying lesions, especially malignant tumors, 2) leptomeningeal tumors, 3) hemorrhage in the brain tumors, 4) intracranial hemorrhage due to hemorrhagic diathesis related to the malignant tumors, and 5) cerebral thrombosis or embolism due to increased blood coagulability secondary to malignancy. In the increase of intracranial pressure, brain edema or disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation due to the presence of brain tumors play more important role than the tumor bulk itself. CT scan is useful for demonstrating the process causing the intracranial hypertension. Therapeutic measures in all patients with increased intracranial pressure are initiated promptly to restore the cardiopulmonary dysfunction if any. Hyperventilation and intravenous infusion of hyperosmolar agents such as mannitol and glycerol have an immediate effect in reducing intracranial pressure when brain edema plays role in increasing it. Steroids are also very effective in reducing brain edema; the effect is less immediate but long lasting. CSF drainage or shunt operation is necessary when dilated ventricular system plays role in the intracranial hypertension. The radical treatment of the intracranial hypertension is a removal of the tumor causing it; however, if not indicated, the second choice is the internal or external decompressions. Postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are also indicated for the malignant brain tumors.
