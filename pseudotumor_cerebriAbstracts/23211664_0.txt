BACKGROUND:: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage may occur in patients with normal or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). We describe herein spontaneous CSF leakage as a result of chronic increased ICP in 4 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Although rhinorrhea previously has been described in IIH patients, to our knowledge this is the first report of otorrhea in these patients. METHODS:: Four patients with spontaneous CSF leakage were examined between 2001 and 2011; 3 presented with rhinorrhea and 1 with otorrhea. Clinical settings and manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS:: All patients were found to have IIH. Three had been diagnosed with IIH several years earlier and had been noncompliant with their medical treatment, whereas in 1 patient, CSF rhinorrhea was the presenting symptom of IIH. CONCLUSION:: CSF leak is a rare complication in IIH patients. We have shown that rhinorrhea can be the presenting sign in these patients and that rhinorrhea and otorrhea can be a late sign of the disease.
