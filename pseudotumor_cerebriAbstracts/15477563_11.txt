Seventeen patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were followed up for 1.8 to 12.8 years (mean 6.5 years). The ventricular catheter was inserted without any guidance device. VPS was effective on all clinical manifestations of IIH. Seven patients required one or two (a total of nine) surgical revisions. The revision rate was significantly less than in two similar series of patients treated with lumboperitoneal shunt.
