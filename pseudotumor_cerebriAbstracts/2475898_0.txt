The most common indications for treatment of patients with pseudotumor cerebri are the presence of severe intractable headaches and evidence of optic neuropathy. The role of the ophthalmologist in following patients with pseudotumor cerebri has been to document optic nerve dysfunction in terms of visual field abnormalities or loss of visual acuity. Macular changes have been described in association with papilledema. A case of pseudotumor cerebri and associated macular disease is reviewed to call attention to the need for the ophthalmologist to differentiate between visual loss secondary to optic neuropathy from that of macular disease. The case illustrates how quickly macular disease can develop. The management of patients with pseudotumor cerebri is discussed.
