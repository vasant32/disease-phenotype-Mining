The aim of this study was to determine the features of pseudotumor cerebri or idiopathic intracranial hypertension in prepubertal and pubertal children. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts of those 16 years and younger, diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri/idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Our study group consisted of 27 patients; the mean age was 10.9 years, and there was a male-to-female ratio of 13 to 14. In the prepubertal group (n = 13), the male-to-female ratio was 8 to 5; in the pubertal group, (n = 14), the ratio was 5 to 9. Overweight or obesity was found in 16 (59%) patients. Outcome was favorable except for one who remained symptomatic. Pseudotumor cerebri/idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children is rare. Its characteristics differ from adults. We found the prepubertal group to be a distinct group since pseudotumor cerebri/idiopathic intracranial hypertension did not occur predominantly in females and was not associated with obesity.
