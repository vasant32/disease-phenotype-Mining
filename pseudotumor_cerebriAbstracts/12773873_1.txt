Neurological symptoms in a patient with large congenital melanocytic naevus are highly suggestive of cerebromeningeal melanoma metastasis. The presence of melanocytic cells in cerebrospinal fluid confirms this diagnosis If their malignant nature is shared with cutaneous naevocytic cells. Conversely, neurocutaneous melanosis is diagnosed when benign melanocytosis meningitis is found in patients with multiple and/or large congenital melanocytic naevus, whether cutaneous naevus cells are benign or not, or when cerebrospinal fluid cells are malignant with benign cutaneous melanocytic naevus. We report the case of a young man aged 19 presenting with multiple and large congenital melanocytic naevus who experienced transcient neurological signs and increased intracranial pressure. Cerebral neuroimaging evoked meningeal infiltration which benign melanocytic nature was supposed on CSF analysis and confirmed by necropsy findings, only 3 month after neurological onset, leading to neurocutaneous melanosis diagnosis. This rare neuroectodermal dysembryoplasia finds expression in various neurological signs, depending on patient's age and leptomeningeal and/or cerebral proliferation localization. Lumbar puncture, cerebral scanography and MRI may help diagnosis, but only histological examination can prove neurocutaneous melanosis, more often by necropsy because of poor prognosis.
