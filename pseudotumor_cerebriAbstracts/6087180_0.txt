The transfer of cefoperazone (CPZ) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain or brain tumor tissue was studied in 13 cases with brain tumor, chronic subdural hematoma and benign intracranial hypertension in 1982. The peak values of CPZ in serum came up immediately after its rapid intravenous administration and then decreased exponentially. The concentration of CPZ in CSF started to increase with a long delay of about 60 min. The average peak level in CSF remained 21.6 micrograms/ml and corresponded to 10.3% of the peak level in serum. The best transfer of chloramphenicol into CSF has been reported, while that of CPZ would be one of the next. The CPZ levels in CSF showed a slower decay than in serum. The concentration of CPZ in brain reached the peak level in less than 30 min and the average peak level was 36.5 micrograms/g cerebral tissue. The brain to blood rate of the CPZ concentration was 11.1%. The CPZ levels in the brain showed a rapid decrease like the transition of antibiotic levels in serum. The antibiotic levels in brain tumors were divided into two groups. The one showed sharp peak about one tenth of the values in serum. The other was of a slowly increasing type.
