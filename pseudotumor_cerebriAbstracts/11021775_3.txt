BACKGROUND: To assess lumboperitoneal shunting as a simple method of relieving communicating hydrocephalus, treating pseudotumor cerebri, and resolving cerebrospinal fluid fistulae. METHOD: Three neurosurgeons at different hospitals report their combined experience over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Ease of insertion of the device and low rate of complications were reported in a combined series of 107 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lumboperitoneal shunting is a technically simple and highly effective surgical technique for diversion of cerebrospinal fluid.
