The case of a 1-year-old boy with pseudotumor cerebri is reported. After the diagnosis had been made, an epidural pressure transducer was implanted. Correlation calculation of the pulse amplitudes and the systolic ICP and Fourier analysis of the ICP modulations were performed. The ICP data reached values up to 50 mmHg and the mathematical calculations provided information on the reduced intracranial compliance. After the implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, all parameters normalized.
