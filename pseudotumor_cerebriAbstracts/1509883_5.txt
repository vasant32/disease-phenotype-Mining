Neurocysticercosis was diagnosed in 0.89% of children enrolled in our Child Neurology Clinic in the years 1979 to 1990. The commonest presenting symptom was seizures (90%) followed by raised intracranial pressure (44%). CT scans revealed a variety of lesions including low and high attenuation cysts, periventricular edema, hydrocephalus and calcification. ELISA was useful in substantiating the diagnosis in almost 70% of cases. Only 18 patients who had active disease merited treatment with praziquantel. The clinical and CT response was good. Follow-up revealed spontaneous quiescence in many patients with inactive disease.
