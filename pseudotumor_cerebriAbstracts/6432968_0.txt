The principles of the perioperative anesthetic management of patients with supratentorial tumors are reviewed. Emphasis is placed upon intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics and the multiple causes of intracranial hypertension which may occur during the perioperative period. The author describes his experiences using routine ICP monitoring in these cases, arguing that this may help both the neurosurgeon and the neuroanesthetist to avoid many of the pitfalls currently associated with the perioperative care of these patients.
