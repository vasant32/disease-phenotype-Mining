PURPOSE: The effects of pCO2 on cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement were observed in four patients. METHODS: Children presenting with either a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of IIH, who were undergoing lumbar puncture under a general anaesthetic for pressure measurement, were recruited to study the relationship between pCO2 and CSF pressure measurements. RESULTS: A rise of end-tidal pCO2 by 1 kPa causes a rise of CSF pressure by 3.5-12 cm H20. CONCLUSION: Controlling of pCO2 is important when measuring CSF pressure to prevent misdiagnosis and over treatment of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
