Intracranial hypertension with papilledema occurred in two patients receiving danazol therapy for either cyclic neutropenia or immune hemolytic anemia. Results of clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiologic studies showed no apparent cause for the condition in Case 1 and the papilledema resolved one month after discontinuing danazol. Carotid angiography in Case 2 demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; the papilledema showed gradual improvement after cessation of danazol. An additional seven cases of pseudotumor cerebri presumed secondary to danazol therapy have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration. The papilledema resolved in all seven cases soon after discontinuing danazol. A drug-induced complication should be suspected, and alternative therapy sought, in patients who develop intracranial hypertension associated with administration of danazol.
