The CSF-pressure-lowering effects of indomethacin in seven patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and one patient with symptomatic intracranial hypertension due to a non-space-occupying meningioma are reported. CSF opening pressure between 350 and 500 mm H2O (mean 400 mm H2O) was promptly reduced by 80 to 200 mm H2O (mean reduction, 139 mm H2O) for at least 10 minutes in all patients after IV administration of 50 mg indomethacin. Four patients had mild and transient side effects (dizziness). Indomethacin might be an alternative drug for treatment of intracranial hypertension.
