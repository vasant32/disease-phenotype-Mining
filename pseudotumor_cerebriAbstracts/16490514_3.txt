PURPOSE: To define the prevalence, natural history, treatment, and prognosis of papilledema-related juxtapapillary subretinal neovascular membranes (SRNVMs). DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Of 1140 cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, six patients had juxtapapillary SRNVM. Three patients were observed, and their final visual acuities were 20/20, 20/50, and 20/200. Three SRNVM involved the fovea; two of the cases were treated with argon laser therapy, and one case was treated with photodynamic therapy. CONCLUSION: SRNVM in idiopathic intracranial hypertension is rare (0.53%). Most cases of juxtapapillary SRNVM are self-limited and regress, can be observed, and have a favorable visual prognosis. The progression of the SRNVM ophthalmoscopically or angiographically toward the fovea, however, might be an indication for laser treatment. Once subfoveal extension occurs, the visual outcome tends to be unfavorable. No patients had recurrence of SRNVM after the resolution of the papilledema.
