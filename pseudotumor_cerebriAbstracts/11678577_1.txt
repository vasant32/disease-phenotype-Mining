Pseudotumor Cerebri is a disease of cerebrospinal fluid pressure regulation. This disease has also been associated with endocrine disorders like Cushing's syndrome, hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and Addison's disease. In this paper we report a 30-year-old male patient with hypoparathyroidism presenting with pseudotumor cerebri and diminished anterior pituitary function that improved after a ventricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt insertion.
