In 14 patients with supratentorial tumours and symptoms of intracranial hypertension the concentrations of HVA and 5-HIAA were determined in cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar tap. Significantly raised levels of both these metabolites were demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid in these patients in relation to controls. The cause of this rise could be excessive production of serotonin or dopamine, increased turnover of these amines or impaired absorption of 5-HIAA and HVA by the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle.
