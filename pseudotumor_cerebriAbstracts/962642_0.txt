A case of pituitary apoplexy following the performance of a pneumoencephalogram is reported. No such a case has been published in the literature, to the author's knowledge. The etiopathogenetic mechanism is discussed and a recomendation is made that surgery should be performed straight after completion of the pneumoencephalogram, should it show a significant supraselar extension of a pituitary adenoma, even in the absence of increased intracranial pressure.
