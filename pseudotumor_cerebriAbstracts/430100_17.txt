Thirty-six patients with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained on 33 patients (91%) after a mean period of 7 1/2 years. Precipitating factors were found in 27 patients (75%). On admission, 5 patients had retro-ocular pain, especially on eye movements, a complaint not yet described in BIH. Seven patients had nystagmus, two of them horizontal positional nystagmus. It is questionable whether all signs in BIH are caused by the raised CSF pressure. The general outcome was good. Only two patients sustained severe ultimate visual impairment. Both presented with retro-ocular pain and sudden loss of vision on admission. Papilloedema can persist for years in BIH without serious visual impairment. Sometimes "causal" treatment is possible. No symptomatic treatment which is free from complications has been proved to prevent visual failure.
