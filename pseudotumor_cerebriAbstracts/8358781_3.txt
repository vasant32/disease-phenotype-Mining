We describe the case report of a migraineur who developed daily postural headache due to benign intracranial hypertension. The CSF pressure was elevated despite the lack of papilledema on clinical examination. This case emphasizes that intracranial hypertension without papilledema must be in the differential diagnosis of the so-called "migraine transformation" headache. Accordingly, CSF analysis, including CSF pressure measurement, should be part of the diagnostic evaluation of "migraine transformation" headache.
