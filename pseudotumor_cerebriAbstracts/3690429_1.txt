We report the case of a 26 year old obese woman who presented with intermittent headaches and blurred vision in her left eye (OS) and on clinical examination had an enlarged visual field blind spot OS with OS disc edema. After an extensive neurologic work up including two nondiagnostic lumbar punctures, a clinical diagnosis of OS anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was made. Gradual progression of visual field loss OS prompted reassessment of the diagnosis and intracranial pressure was confirmed to be markedly elevated by usage of a subarachnoid monitoring bolt, thus establishing the diagnosis of pseudotumour cerebri. An optic nerve sheath fenestration was performed OS with subsequent reversal of the progressive visual field loss.
