Results obtained with three different CSF ventricular drainage methods (intermittent with no outflow resistance, continuous against a positive pressure, continuous with pre-arranged positive pressure), were evaluated in fifty nine cases of traumatic cerebral lesions and spontaneous intracerebral hematomas with intracranial hypertension. Continuous CSF withdrawal gives better clinical results and is more effective in controlling intracranial pressure than intermittent drainage (50% vs 13% successes respectively). Results obtained with continuous drainage against a steady positive pressure and with a pre-arranged pressure ("tidal drainage") are almost similar. However an outflow resistance 3-5 mmHg higher than diastolic level of ICP represents a rational approach to the problem.
