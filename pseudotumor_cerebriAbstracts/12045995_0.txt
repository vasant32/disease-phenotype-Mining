We report two cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. These patients, with known Graves' ophthalmopathy, presented with new onset optic disc edema and preserved visual function. Moderate enlargement of the extraocular muscles was observed in one case and moderate expansion of the orbital fat volume was observed in the second case. Lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure and normal cerebrospinal fluid composition in both patients. Also, no intracranial abnormalities were seen with neuroimaging studies. The findings in these patients suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension as a second concurrent diagnosis, and should be considered as a possible etiology of optic disc edema in patients with Graves√æ ophthalmopathy and preserved visual function.
