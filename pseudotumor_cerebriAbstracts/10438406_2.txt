Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a dangerous and sometimes life-threatening complication of ovulation induction with exogenous gonadotrophins. While many complications of severe OHSS are recognized we have only identified one review detailing neurological problems. This report concerns a 32-year-old patient with bilateral tubal blockage who achieved her first pregnancy following in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. Shortly after embryo transfer she developed clinical signs of moderate OHSS with symptoms which were later diagnosed as benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). The BIH was treated effectively using repeated lumbar puncture and diuretics. Spontaneous labour and delivery occurred at 40 weeks' gestation. There was no neurological sequel and no recurrence of the BIH 2 years after the pregnancy. The possible link between OHSS and BIH is discussed as well as the risks of further pregnancy.
