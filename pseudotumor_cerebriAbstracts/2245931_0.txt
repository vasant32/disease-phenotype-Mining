This is undoubtedly a rather rare clinical picture. The existence of a brain pressure syndrome with symptoms such as headache, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and diplopia simulates a brain tumor, even though the radiological and tomographical evidence is absolutely normal. Therapeutic possibilities are steroid medication, lumbar punctions, as well as a neurosurgical intervention installing a lumboperitoneal drainage. We deem the initial dosage of 16 mg Millicorten/day to be therapeutically effective and adequate.
