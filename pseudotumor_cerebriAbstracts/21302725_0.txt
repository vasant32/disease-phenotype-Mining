Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical condition characterized by elevated intracranial pressure and absence of clinical, laboratory or radiographic evidence of central nervous system infection, vascular malformation, intracranial space occupying lesion or hydrocephalus. In the last years the raising understanding of pediatric IIH, especially concerning its demographics and epidemiology, has brought up to a redefinition of diagnostic criteria and reevaluation of pathogenesis and treatment. The authors reviewed the records of nineteen consecutive children with newly diagnosed IIH in order to compare demographic characteristics, clinical pictures and ophthalmologic aspects as optic disc evaluation and visual field evaluation, as well as treatment modalities and follow up. Beside obesity and female gender, potential alternative risk factors remains to be investigated, which need a good collaboration between neuro-ophthalmologists and pediatric neurologists.
