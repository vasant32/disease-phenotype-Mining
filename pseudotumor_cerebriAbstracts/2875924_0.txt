The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of somatostatin in patients with brain tumours, communicating hydrocephalus, lumbar-disc disease (treated as a control) were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. The somatostatin concentration in the patients with brain tumours and intracranial hypertension was significantly higher compared to those with brain tumours and normal CSF pressure. CSF somatostatin content in patients with communicating hydrocephalus, was similar to patients with brain tumours and normal CSF pressure, and did not show a significant difference from the control group. The authors discuss possible reasons for such results obtained in patients with brain tumours and intracranial hypertension.
