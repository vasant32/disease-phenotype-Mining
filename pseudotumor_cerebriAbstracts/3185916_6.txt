This study compared visual evoked potentials (VEP) and contrast sensitivity (CS) as methods of detecting visual loss in 15 women with acute onset of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). A total of 24 out of 30 eyes (14 of 15 patients) had a visual disturbance. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination demonstrated abnormal Goldmann visual fields in 13 of 30 eyes. CS was abnormal in 18 eyes; VEP was abnormal in five eyes. Nine eyes had visual loss detected by CS only, five by perimetry only, and one had the VEP as the sole abnormality. CS was a valuable adjunct to perimetry in PTC whereas VEP was rarely helpful.
