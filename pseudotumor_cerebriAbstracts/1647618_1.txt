Analysis is made of the efficacy of the treatment of CSF hypertension in 40 patients in the phase of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. Use was made of sorption detoxication methods: hemoperfusion (the author's certificate No.1466754) and enterosorption (the priority certificate No.4465054/14 (115542) dated July 22, 1988). SKH-IK and SKH-2K sorbents were employed as hemoperfusion, using the venovenous scheme of perfusion, the volumetric rate of the blood flow being 100-120 ml/min during 2-3 hours. Altogether 2-3 sessions were carried out, with an interval of 5 to 7 days. For enterosorption, use was made of a crumbled up filamentous carbonic sorbent in a dose of 50-60 mg per kg bw 3 times a day for 20 days in 2 hourly intervals between food intake. Regression of the neurological symptoms began 2-3 hours after the first session of hemoperfusion and 5-6 days after the beginning of the intake of the filamentous carbonic sorbent, increasing throughout the whole treatment course. That coincided with the disappearance of CSF hypertension and normalization of the immunological spectrum of the blood serum. Sorption detoxication brought about no complications and is a method of choice in the treatment of CSF hypertension in patients in the phase of multiple sclerosis exacerbation.
