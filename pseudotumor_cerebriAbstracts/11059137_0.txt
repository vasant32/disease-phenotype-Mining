The Goal of this study was prospective evaluation of the blood flow parameters-maximal systolic velocity (MSV), minimal diastolic velocity (MDV) and Pourcelot's resistivity index (RI) in patients with swollen optic dis. 63 patients (79 eyes) were examined with swollen optic disc-10 patients (17 eyes) with intracranial hypertension, 12 patients (14 eyes) with pseudoedema of disk of the optic nerve, 7 patients (7 eyes) with inflammation swollen optic disc, 3 patients (6 eyes) with pseudotumor cerebri, 8 patients (12 eyes) with arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (A-AION) and 23 patients (23 eyes) with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION) and 23 patients (23 eyes) with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION). All patients had ophthalmological examinations and Color Doppler ultrasonography in central retinal artery (CRA), posterior ciliary artery (PCA), ophthalmic artery (OA) and in central retinal vein (CRV). The blood flow parameters of the swollen optic disc and normal optic disc were not significant changed at intracranial hypertension, pseudooedema cerebri, inflammation swelling, and at pseudotumour od the optic disc. A-AION and N-AION acallocated significant changes of the blood velocities and resistivity index. A-AION: significant increasing resistivity index at CRA, CPA, significant decrease of MSV and MDV and difficult mapping of the CPA in Color doppler mapping. At the fellow eye (without swollen optic disc) was significant decreasing of the blood velocities of the CRA, CPA, but not so much as at the defective eye with swollen optic nerve disk. N-AION: defective eye with swollen optic disc--there were: nonsignificant decreasing of MSV, MDV, significant decreasing of MSV, MDV and increasing of resistivity index of the CRA, CPA at the fellow eye. AO was without significant changes. Color Doppler information allowed to specify diagnosis of A-AION and N-AION.
