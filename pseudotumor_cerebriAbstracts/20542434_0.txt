Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is a severe childhood epilepsy syndrome characterised by the diagnostic triad of a slow spike and wave pattern on electroencephalogram, multiple seizure types and developmental delay. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a syndrome characterised by raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion or ventricular dilatation and often headache. We present the first reported case of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome associated with symptomatic idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a 15 year old male, requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion by means of ventriculoperitoneal shunting.
