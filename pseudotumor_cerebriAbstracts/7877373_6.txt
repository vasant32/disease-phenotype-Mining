BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic  distribution of patients consulting because of headache in a neurology department. METHODS: The clinical records of 3,498 patients who had consulted specifically due to headache between 1978 to 1993 were retrospectively studied. Diagnosis was reclassified according to the criteria of the new headache classification with data concerning the age of onset and sex distribution also being collected. RESULTS: The most frequent diagnoses were migraine (1,802 patients; 52%)  tension-type headache (113; 32%), followed in decreasing order by trigeminal neuralgia, post injury headache, cluster headache, subarachnoid hemorrhage, analgesic-ergotamine abuse headache, tumoral headache, cervical disease headache, benign exertional headache, due to paranasal sinusal disorders and benign intracranial hypertension. Female predominance was observed in the whole series (68%) as in the groups with migraine, tension-type headache, neuralgia headache by analgesic-ergotamine drugs and benign intracranial hypertension. Cluster, post injury, tumor and provoked headaches (cough, exertional and sexual) were found to be more frequent in men. The age of onset was very specific for each kind of headache. The percentage of symptomatic headaches increased in direct relation to age, being 10 fold higher in patients over the age of 65. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic distribution of headache as a cause of medical consultation is very different to the prevalence of different headaches. This distribution by diagnosis largely depends on the age of the patient at the time of headaches onset [corrected].
