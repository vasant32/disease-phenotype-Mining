A 14-y-old girl presented with a 2 h history of left hemiplegia preceded by mild left-sided sensory disturbance. She had experienced migraines for several years and there was a strong family history of migraine, including hemiplegic migraine in one of her sisters. Her hemiplegia and headache responded to sumatriptan but her headache and vomiting subsequently returned. She was found to have intracranial hypertension and developed papilloedema and paracentral scotomas. Further history revealed she had been taking minocycline for acne. Conclusion: An association between hemiplegic migraine and pseudotumour cerebri has not previously been reported. There may be a case for examining patients with pseudotumour cerebri for the calcium channel mutation (CACNA1A).
