Pseudotumor cerebri is a syndrome with headaches and visual loss that sometimes cannot be treated with medication. In spite of medical treatment, the clinical course in some patients can approach extreme dysfunction with severe impairment in visual field and acuity as well as incapacitating headache. Patients with progressive or persistent symptoms require surgical treatment and decompression of the optic nerve is the preferred surgical procedure. We report on two cases of bilateral decompression of the optic nerves performed through an endonasal endoscopic approach.
