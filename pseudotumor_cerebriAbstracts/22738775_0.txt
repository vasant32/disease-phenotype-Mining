BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature supporting venous sinus stenosis as a causative etiology for many patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Recent series have documented improvement in the pre- and post-stenosis venous pressure gradient as well as clinical symptoms after stenting. Concomitant real time intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has not been previously described during venous sinus stenting. CASE REPORT: A woman in her twenties presented with rapidly progressive visual loss and cranial neuropathies with an MRI revealing high grade right transverse sinus stenosis. Lumbar puncture demonstrated an opening pressure >55 cm H(2)O. Her vision and cranial neuropathies continued to worsen despite ventriculoperitoneal shunting. A parenchymal ICP monitoring wire was placed, revealing ICP persistently >70 cm H(2)O. She underwent venography and a pre- to post-stenosis pressure gradient of 55 mm Hg was measured. The patient underwent sinus stenting resulting in a near immediate reduction in her ICP from 70 to 20 cm H(2)O within 30 s after deployment. Her ICP completely normalized within 24 h of stenting. CONCLUSIONS: A case is presented of severe intracranial hypertension with rapidly progressive neurologic decline despite CSF diversion secondary to venous sinus stenosis that resolved following venous sinus stenting. This is the first report of real time ICP monitoring during venous sinus stenting.
