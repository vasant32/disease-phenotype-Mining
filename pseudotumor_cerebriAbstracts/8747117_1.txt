A 7-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease on long-term peritoneal dialysis is described. The child developed intracranial hypertension and acute glaucoma during therapy with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), 18 months after the onset of treatment. Symptoms developed within 1.5 days and required neurosurgical treatment to reduce the intracranial hypertension because of imminent impaction of the cerebellum and brain stem. After ventricular cerebrospinal fluid drainage and cessation of growth hormone, all symptoms of intracranial hypertension and increased intraocular pressure disappeared. To our knowledge this is the first report of intracranial hypertension or hydrocephalus and acute glaucoma during rhGH therapy. Continuous and long-term control of the ophthalmological and neurological status of patients treated with rhGh is indicated.
