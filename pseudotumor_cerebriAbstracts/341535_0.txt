The case report is presented of a 24-year-old male who developed the clinical signs and syptoms of pseudotumour cerebri (intracranial hypertension) twice during the course of protracted rejection 1 and 4 months after renal transplantation. Clinically, headache, nausea, hypertensive crisis and, finally, severe coma with an acute mid-brain syndrome was observed. Neurologically a mild left-sided hemiparesis was found on the second occasion. Examination of the fundi revealed bilateral papilloedema. Electroencephalograms showed pathological changes of a diffuse nature, later followed by abnormal delta range activity in the right frontotemporal projection. The withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy may have been responsible for the pseudotumour cerebri in this case.
