A thorough examination of 410 children with the preliminary diagnosis of neuro-arthritic diathesis revealed a family history of primary disorders of purine metabolism with hyperuricemia (HU) and hyperuricuria (HUK) in combination with borderline neuropsychic disturbances in 150 children. Most of the children (122 of the 150) presented disorders of the neurotic level of reactivity according to the type of systemic and monosystemic neuroses and neurotic reactions in the presence of moderate HU and HUK. The clinical picture in children with the signs of residual-organic cerebral insufficiency (28 of the 150) was predominantly characterized by behavioural abnormalities in conjunction with significant deviations on the part of purine metabolism parameters.
