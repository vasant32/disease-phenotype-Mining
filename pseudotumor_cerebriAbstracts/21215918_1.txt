Facial nerve palsies are uncommon in infants. We report on 10-week-old monozygotic twins, diagnosed with cystic fibrosis by newborn screening, who developed facial palsy and increased intracranial pressure. Cranial imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis produced normal results. Levels of serum vitamin A were below normal range. Low levels of vitamin A are associated with facial nerve paralysis, and are at least partly implicated in the development of increased intracranial pressure in infants with cystic fibrosis.
