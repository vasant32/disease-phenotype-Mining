Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, characterized by headache, visual disturbance, papilledema, and increased intracranial pressure in the absence of space-occupying lesions, has been reported in pediatric recipients several months to years following kidney transplantation (KTx). We describe the development of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a 10-year-old girl in the first few hours after KTx. We hypothesize that this event was associated with thymoglobulin administration, perhaps on the background of growth hormone therapy. Awareness of this possibility could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of children with similar risk factors.
