Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a rare condition in which the pathophysiology remains unclear. Multiple theories have been proposed in the past to explain BIH. Today it is widely accepted that the condition occurs in situations where alteration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption is encountered. The venous system is therefore involved and may be the common denominator of the pathophysiological theories. A distinction must be made between idiopathic benign intracranial hypertension and BIH resulting from drugs, other pathological conditions, or toxics (secondary BIH), which are reported in this paper. We emphasize the crucial role of exhaustive clinical, biological, and neuroradiological investigations aiming to establish the diagnosis of BIH.
