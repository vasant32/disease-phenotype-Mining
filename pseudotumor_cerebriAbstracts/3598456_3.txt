Striking electrocardiographic abnormalities have been noted in some patients with central nervous system injury. To study the relationship between the electrocardiogram and intracranial pressure, intracranial pressure was elevated in 14 open chest pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The right vagus was stimulated to produce sinus slowing and the right atrium was paced at a constant cycle length fast enough to prevent arrhythmias and maintain heart rate constant (750 msec in 11 dogs and 600 msec in three dogs). In nine dogs, intracranial pressure was sequentially elevated to 100, 150, and 200 mmHg. Systolic arterial blood pressure consistently rose to exceed intracranial pressure (P less than 0.005). At a pressure of 150 and 200 mmHg, mean QT intervals shortened significantly in recorded leads II, X, Y, and Z from 0.01). T wave changes were also noted that consisted of increasing positivity in leads II, X, and Y and increasing negativity in lead Z. To delinate the role of the sympathetic nervous system, an additional five dogs were subjected to an intracranial pressure of 200 mmHg before and after bilateral stellate ganglionectomy and timolol (0.1 mg/kg IV). Elimination of sympathetic influences did not significantly alter the electrocardiographic effects of elevated intracranial pressure. Thus, intracranial hypertension results in significant QT shortening and T wave changes that are not entirely mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.
