Ventricular catheter replacement can be challenging, especially in patients with small ventricles. Shunt malfunction due to ventricular catheter obstruction can occur without ventricular enlargement, such as in the setting of slit-ventricle syndrome or benign intracranial hypertension. The authors describe a simple technique for ventricular catheter exchange using a peel-away catheter. In the limited initial experience of the senior author (G.S.C.), this technique appears to be safe and effective. To the authors' knowledge, this method has not been described in the neurosurgical literature before.
