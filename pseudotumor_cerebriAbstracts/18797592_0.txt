Recombinant human growth hormone (hrGH) has been used for treatment of growth hormone deficient children over 20 years and it can be considered to have an excellent safety profile. The main international surveys show few adverse drug reactions reported, specially in idiopathic growth hormone deficiency and in idiopathic short stature. With regard to cancer risk or tumor recurrence, it seems that there is no greater risk with hrGH treatment in comparison to general population. The idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare condition, but its incidence is higher in patients with chronic renal failure. The adverse events are rare in patients treated with hrGH, but these patients should be carefully monitored, specially those with pharmacologycal doses or with another clinical condition of greater risk.
