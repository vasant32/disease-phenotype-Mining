A patient with Cushing's disease developed intracranial hypertension 1 month after the removal of an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated normal ventricles and no intracranial mass, establishing the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. The elevated intracranial pressure was apparently consequent to an abrupt reduction in circulating corticosteroids. The development of pseudotumor cerebri after the correction of endogenous hypercortisolism has not been reported previously. This potential complication of the surgical treatment of Cushing's disease can be managed with prompt recognition and appropriate treatment of the syndrome.
