OBJECTIVES: Pseudotumour cerebri has been previously recognized as a neurological side effect of combined oral contraceptives but has not been diagnosed with a delay of 3 years after initiation of combined oral contraceptives. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old obese woman developed visual impairment and headache, 4 months after starting combined oral contraceptives. Three years later symptoms deteriorated and she presented with prominent tendon-jerks and congested optical-discs. Normal CSF drained with high pressure from the spinal tap. Pseudotumour cerebri was diagnosed. Headache and visual impairment resolved within 3 weeks after discontinuation of combined oral contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Combined oral contraceptives-induced pseudotumour cerebri may remain undetected for years. Young, obese women with visual impairment and headache under combined oral contraceptives should undergo immediate neurological and ophthalmological investigation.
