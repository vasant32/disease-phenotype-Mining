The authors studied the incidence of hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension in 60 patients with severe craniocerebral trauma from comparison of the findings of computed tomography and the results of prolonged monitoring of intracranial pressure. The mechanisms of the development of hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension are described. Hydrocephalus is among the causes of intracranial hypertension. In view of this, external fractional drainage of the ventricular CSF should be applied together with the removal of intracranial hematomas and measures of intensive therapy in patients with severe craniocerebral trauma.
