The article analyses the late results of surgical treatment of 123 patients with parasagittal meningiomas of various localization along the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and falx cerebri (FC). Invalidism of patients after operations for meningiomas of the middle third of the sagittal line is still high because of stable motor defects. The results of operations for SSS resection without restoration of venous outflow of the hemisphere are poorer. Recurrences of the disease were revealed in one fourth of patients in different periods after surgery. The possibility of rehabilitation of the patient after an operation for recurrences of the tumor considerably reduces with each subsequent recurrence.
