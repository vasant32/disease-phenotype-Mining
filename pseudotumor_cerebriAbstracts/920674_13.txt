In a study of 38 children with pseudotumor cerebri, the evaluation of the response to treatment received special emphasis. Sixteen children underwent spontaneous remission following diagnosis, or improved following sequential lumbar punctures. Sixteen other children were treated with corticosteroids. Of this group, four children who failed to respond to repeated lumbar punctures prior to the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, had their subsequent course on varying doses of steroids charted clinically and by frequent measurement of the CSF pressure. An Inverse relationship of steroid dosage to CSF pressure was documented, as was the children's dependence on corticosteroid therapy for continued remission as the pseudotumor cerebri ran its course. In twelve other children, treatment with corticosteroids may have been effective. Two children had neurosurgical procedures. Permanent visual deficit did not occur in any child.
