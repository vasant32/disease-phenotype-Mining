The pattern and pathogenesis of nonlocalizing visual disturbances, associated with optic disc edema (ODE). raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and intracranial space-taking lesions were investigated experimentally in rhesus monkeys with simulated progressive brain tumor and clinically in patients with benign intracranial hypertension. The visual disturbances occurring in one of both eyes were of three types: recurrent attacks of transient obscuration, permanent blindness, and various types of visual field defects. The studies indicate that the visual disturbances are usually due to two mechanisms. The most common is ischemia of the optic disc secondary to ODE. The other, rarer mechanism probably consists of the space-taking lesion causing downward herniation of the parahippocampal gyrus into the tentorial notch, producing compression of the lateral geniculate body and optic tract.
