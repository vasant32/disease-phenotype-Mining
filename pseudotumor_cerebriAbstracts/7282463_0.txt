A nine-year-old boy, presenting only with signs of increased ICP, underwent computerized tomography. This examination demonstrated no abnormalities in the precontrast scan. Following C. E., it showed scattered areas of blood-like density in both hemispheres, as well as a presumedly abnormal vessel in the left occipital region and dilated vein of Galen, sinus rectus, and tentorial veins. The presumptive diagnosis of left occipital AVM was not confirmed by angiography, which also ruled out obstructions of the intracranial sinuses. The possible mechanism responsible for this atypical CT picture is briefly discussed in the light of pertinent literature. It is suggested that careful consideration should be given to the indications for angiography in similar cases, in the presence of a "hypervascular" aspect of the postcontrast CT scan, particularly if a considerable amount of contrast medium has been used.
