The authors evaluate the case of a 20-year-old, four-month-pregnant woman who presented with papilledema and visual field loss, and developed headache, intermittent diplopia and impairment of color vision over the next month. The procedures and considerations leading to the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri are discussed, as are the various modes of therapy and their indications.
