Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) may lead to blindness and rarely deafness. We describe the case of a rapidly deteriorating 14-year-old African girl who presented with headaches associated with complete visual and hearing loss due to BIH. This was managed non-operatively with lumbar cerebrospinal fluid tap, weight reduction, nicotinic acid and acetazolamide. Response to treatment was quite dramatic with resolution of severe headaches and regaining of light perception 8 days after commencing treatment. By 3 months hearing recovered to normal and there was resolution of vision. This to the best of our knowledge is the first reported case of complete visual and hearing loss occurring in a patient with BIH, which was managed successfully non-operatively. When indicated, non-operative management is an effective treatment option even in malignant BIH.
