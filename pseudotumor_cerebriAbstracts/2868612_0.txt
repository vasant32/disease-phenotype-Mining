In West Germany, head injury is the major cause both of death following trauma and of irreversible cerebral damage. The successful management of these cases largely depends on the prevention and treatment of secondary rises in intracranial pressure. The only certain way of detecting such increases is with the invasive technique of intracranial pressure monitoring. The pressure module should be implanted as soon as possible, ideally, before extensive definitive surgical treatment is carried out. Ease of usage has led us to prefer epidural pressure monitoring systems. Being relatively easy to learn and apply, this form of monitoring should be used in all hospitals involved in the treatment of severe head injury.
