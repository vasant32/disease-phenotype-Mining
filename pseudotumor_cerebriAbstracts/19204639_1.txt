Tetracyclines are a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris that are associated with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). With doxycycline specifically, however, the incidence of PTC is very rare. A patient was using oral doxycycline and topical retinoids for acne, and within two months she developed PTC. This case illustrates that despite the rarity of doxycycline-induced PTC, patients and physicians should be aware of this possibility. Furthermore, in the setting of new-onset headaches or visual changes, early ophthalmologic examination for papilledema is recommended for early diagnosis.
