A 32-year-old asymptomatic woman was found to have unilateral papilledema on routine ophthalmological examination. Subsequent visual field, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were consistent with the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. This case demonstrates that pseudotumor cerebri may present as unilateral papilledema in any asymptomatic patient and illustrates the need for thorough neuro-ophthalmological evaluations to allow early detection of cases with atypical presentations to increase the efficacy of therapeutic intervention and prevent progressive visual loss.
