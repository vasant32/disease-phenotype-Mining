The aim of this study was to describe the association between pediatric pseudotumor cerebri and low serum vitamin A levels. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 6 children (5 boys, 1 girl; mean age 8 years) with increased intracranial pressure and low serum vitamin A levels (mean 16.0 ± 8.8 µg/dL). The etiology of the vitamin A deficiency was a restricted diet (2 children), intestinal malabsorption caused by celiac disease (2 children), and undetermined cause (2 children). Only 1 child had ocular signs of xerosis. Poor visual acuity at presentation and lower serum vitamin A levels were associated with a poor visual outcome and development of optic atrophy. In conclusion, pseudotumor cerebri in children can be associated with vitamin A deficiency even when other manifestations of xerophthalmia do not exist. Early recognition of this condition and appropriate therapy can prevent blindness.
