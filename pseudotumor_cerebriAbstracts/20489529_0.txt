 OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunting is commonly used to treat hydrocephalus when ventriculoperitoneal shunting has failed. Placement of a VA shunt in patients with narrowing or occlusion of the central veins presents considerable difficulty because few imaging modalities exist to safely and reliably insert a guidewire or atrial catheter past the occlusion. We report the use of intraoperative venography to guide the placement of the distal portion of a VA shunt in a patient with a valve blocking the left brachiocephalic vein. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old man with pseudotumor cerebri and a left ventriculoperitoneal shunt presented with severe headaches. He was diagnosed with partial distal shunt obstruction. Because of a history of failed attempts at ventriculoperitoneal shunting, conversion to a VA shunt via the left internal jugular vein was planned. TECHNIQUE: Surgery was performed by using the standard technique until resistance was encountered when inserting a guidewire into the internal jugular vein. Intraoperative venography of the central veins was performed, which showed a large valve blocking progression of the guidewire in the left brachiocephalic vein. Using fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.035-inch guidewire was successfully directed through the vein past the obstruction and exchanged for a peel-away introducer. The distal shunt catheter was then inserted, and the correct position in the atrium was confirmed fluoroscopically. CONCLUSION: When obstruction of the central veins is found during a VA shunting procedure, intraoperative venography is a useful method to aid in the placement of the atrial catheter through the central veins.
