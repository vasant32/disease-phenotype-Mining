The intracranial pressure of 31 patients with bacterial meningitis, in a comatose state and with a score lower than 6 on Glasgow's scale, was monitored by means of an extradural captor in order to detect intracranial hypertension and optimize its treatment. All patients had intracranial hypertension during the first 48 hours. Brain perfusion pressure was inferior to 50 mmHg in 5 cases. Computed tomography of the brain showed cerebral oedema in 16 cases. Twenty (64%) of the patient survived, 15 of them without sequelae. Monitoring intracranial pressure in patients with bacterial meningitis and coma makes it possible to optimize treatment and shows that a less than 50 mmHg brain perfusion pressure is associated with a 100% death rate.
