Long-term prognosis and visual outcome of 54 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was studied. Mean observation period was 6.2 years; 33 patients had two or more recurrences. Visual acuity was preserved in all patients without recurrence and in 86% of patients with recurrences. Recurrences did not occur while patients were maintained on acetazolamide. No statistical difference was found between IIH patients who had only one event, compared to the recurrent group.
