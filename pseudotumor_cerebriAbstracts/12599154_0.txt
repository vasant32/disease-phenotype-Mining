INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by non caseating granulomas in different organs. The respiratory system is the most frequently involved organ system. Up to 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have pulmonary involvement. The neurological involvement is rare and only occurs in the 5 7% of the patients. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 41 years old woman who had severe headache and a sixth nerve palsy. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made in association with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoidosis can involve any portion of the nervous system. An etiologic association between sarcoidosis and IIH could be identified in this case. Treatment with corticosteroids, repeated lumbar punctures and diuretics were prescribed and induced a significant clinical improvement.
