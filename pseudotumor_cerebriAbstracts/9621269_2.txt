Two cases of a benign form of optic disc edema after successful trabeculectomy are reported. In both patients, optic disc edema was noted 2 to 4 weeks after trabeculectomy. The edema occurred without loss of visual acuity or field. The absolute intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure were normal--that is, the edema was not a syndrome of hypotony or pseudotumor cerebri. However, both patients had intracranial pressure in the high-normal range. The decrease in intraocular pressure into the low normal range after trabeculectomy may have altered the intracranial pressure:intraocular pressure ratio at the lamina cribrosa enough to produce optic disc edema.
