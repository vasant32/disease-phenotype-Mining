Three young women with papilledema secondary to pseudotumor cerebri evolved mottled macular pigmentation with preservation of normal visual acuity. Choroidal folds or macular star figures were observed. These macular changes could represent the sequelae of either macular edema or a mechanical disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium. The mechanism of choroidal folds in papilledema remains uncertain.
