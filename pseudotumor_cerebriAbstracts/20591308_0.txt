Summary: Two patients with dural sinus stenosis of different causes presenting with refractory benign intracranial hypertension were confirmed by angiogram. Stent-assistant angioplasty was used to dilate the stenosed sinusesand led to prompt clinical improvement. Relative long-term followup showed good patency of the stented sinuses.
