A 12-year-old girl presented with primary hypothyroidism, secondary pituitary hyperplasia, and intracranial hypertension. Cranial computed tomography revealed a sellar mass with suprasellar extension. She responded to medical treatment. Intracranial hypertension may be associated with primary hypothyroidism prior to thyroxine treatment. Because significant pituitary hyperplasia can be associated with primary hypothyroidism, it is vital to have endocrine investigation prior to consideration of surgical removal of an apparent pituitary tumor.
