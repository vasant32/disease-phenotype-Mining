OBJECTIVE: The role of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures in the pathophysiology of various CSF leaks is not clear. Empty sella syndrome (ESS) is a radiographic finding that can be associated with elevated CSF pressures and may represent a radiographic indicator of intracranial hypertension. We present our experience with CSF leaks of various causes, the prevalence of ESS in the spontaneous and nonspontaneous categories, and the potential pathophysiology and unique management issues of the spontaneous CSF leak group. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records, imaging studies, and surgical treatment of CSF leaks in patients treated by the senior author. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with spontaneous CSF leaks and 12 patients with nonspontaneous CSF leaks were surgically treated from 1996 through 2002. In the spontaneous group, 15 patients had complete imaging of the sella turcica. Ten had completely empty sellae and 5 had partially empty sellae, for a total of 100% (15 of 15). In the nonspontaneous group, 9 patients had complete imaging of the sella. Only 11% (1 of 9) had a partially empty sella and that was a congenital leak. Comparison of proportions between these 2 groups was significant (P = 0.01). The spontaneous group consisted primarily of obese, middle-aged females (13 of 16 patients). CONCLUSION: Empty sella probably represents a sign of elevated intracranial pressure that leads to idiopathic, spontaneous CSF leaks. Spontaneous CSF leaks are strongly associated with the radiographic finding of an empty sella and are more common in obese females, similar to benign intracranial hypertension. This unique population may require more aggressive surgical and medical treatment to prevent recurrent or multiple leaks.
