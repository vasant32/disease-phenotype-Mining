The acute chest syndrome is a clinical entity appearing in patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia. It presents with pleuritic pain, fever, leucocytosis and pulmonary infiltrates in the thoracic radiology. The etiological diagnosis is difficult, and it is necessary to distinguish between pneumonia and pulmonary infarction. This syndrome is quite frequent among the patients at risk, and can be lethal according to the severity and the etiology of the event. A case of acute chest syndrome due to a S. pneumoniae sepsis is presented. The interest of the case lies in the rareness of this disease in our population and the peculiar evolutive clinical features of this case, with the development of intracranial hypertension and death.
