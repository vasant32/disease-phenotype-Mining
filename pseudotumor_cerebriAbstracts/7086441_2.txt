The intracranial pressure was monitored continuously for at least 48 hours in five patients with empty sella syndrome, who did not have clinical benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). It has been suggested that the empty sella syndrome is a result of chronically elevated intracranial pressure in the presence of a congenitally deficient diaphragma sellae. However, whilst the intracranial pressure in two of the five patients was abnormally high, in three patients in whom it was monitored, the CSF pressure was normal. Although these cases may represent "burnt out" forms of intracranial pressure problems, it might be that the normal pulsations of CSF are sufficient to produce the empty sella in the presence of a deficient diaphragma sella.
