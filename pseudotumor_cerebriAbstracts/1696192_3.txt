Three patients with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (PSLE) and autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AT), who developed unacceptable side effects (pseudotumor cerebri, hypertension, excessive weight gain) from treatment with steroids, were treated successfully with vincristine (2 patients) or intravenous immunoglobulin (1 patient). All patients remained off steroids without any complications for 11 to 23 months.
