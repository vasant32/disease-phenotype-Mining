A 6 year-old girl was admitted with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. These manifestations spontaneously disappeared, then recurred a few days later, leading to the discovery of hydrocephalus with increased protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. A cervical spine tumor was diagnosed by magnetic nuclear resonance examination. The patient was successfully operated on for a benign astrocytoma. In the absence of a cerebral tumor, cervical spinal tumors should be looked for when recurring symptoms of intracranial hypertension occur in a child.
