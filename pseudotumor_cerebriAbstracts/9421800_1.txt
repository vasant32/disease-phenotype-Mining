Benign intracranial hypertension and communicating hydrocephalus are uncommon but important disorders that affect cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. They have clinical similarities but their management is usually different. The factors determining which of the two disorders will develop include brain compliance, the state of the cranial sutures, the nature of the insult and its magnitude. I propose that the time course of the pathological events leading to presentation may be a further factor to consider in the pathogenesis and management of these disorders.
