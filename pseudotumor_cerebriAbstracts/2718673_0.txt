Combined clinical neurological study was performed in 111 schizophrenic patients with acute, subacute psychotic signs and at the end of psychosis. Techniques included echoencephalography, eye fundus study, spinal puncture. None of the patients had a history of craniocerebral trauma, neuroinfections, chronic alcoholism, severe somatic diseases. In 53.1% of the patients intracranial hypertension syndrome was detected with the highest rate in patients with acute psychotic signs. Besides, the hypertension syndrome was found to be related to the type of schizophrenia course: it was twice as frequent in attack forms as in permanent ones. The authors suggest that intracranial hypertension has a distinct role to play in the pathogenesis of acute schizophrenic attacks.
