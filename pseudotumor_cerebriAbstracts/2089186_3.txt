A patient with nephrotic syndrome developed pseudotumor cerebri following glucocorticoid therapy. Diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was based on satisfaction of four criteria proposed by Ahlskog and O'Neill. The symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri disappeared within 10 days. After a three-week interval of remission, relapse occurred. Glycerol and urokinase produced rapid resolution of the symptoms and warfarin prevented further recurrence of pseudotumor cerebri for one year. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri might be associated with the hypercoagulable state which was induced by glucocorticoid therapy and nephrotic syndrome.
