A 5-year-old patient developed pseudotumor cerebri, spinal and radicular pain, and hyporeflexia. Ataxia and multiple cranial nerve involvement also were evident. With the exception of residual hyporeflexia and the abnormalities present in the electrophysiologic studies, the patient's prompt recovery suggested the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr√© polyradiculoneuritis.
