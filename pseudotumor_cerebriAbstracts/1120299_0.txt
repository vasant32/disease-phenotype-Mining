Through an artificially created carotid-cavernous fistula, the cavernous sinus of four suitable cadavers was perfused at a constant input pressure of 50 cm H20 at various levels of intracranial pressure. The flow rate fell 25% at an intracranial pressure of 50 mm Hg but could not be totally arrested even at the extremes of intracranial hypertension. The authors conclude that the cavernous sinus in man is not collapsible.
