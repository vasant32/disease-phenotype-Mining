OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts in carefully selected children with abnormalities of the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging studies, indications for treatment and pre- and postoperative symptoms of 25 patients (mean age 9.6 years) who had undergone LP shunting in the past 10 years in a single pediatric neurosurgical practice were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Indications for treatment included postoperative pseudomeningocele, pseudotumor cerebri and a severe form of slit ventricle syndrome. Preoperative symptoms resolved completely in all 25 patients as a result of the shunt, and no patient developed symptomatic or radiographic hindbrain herniation. Twenty-one shunts incorporated valve mechanisms. CONCLUSION: LP shunts may be used for specific indications without excessive risk of hindbrain herniation.
