A 34-year-old woman was admitted for the chief complaints of headache and blurred vision. She had bilateral papilledema and slight increase in CSF pressure (175mmH2O) with normal visual acuity and field. Neurological and hormonal examination were normal except for over response of PRL and TSH to TRH test. The sella was enlarged and MRI and metrizamide CT demonstrated intrasellar CSF filling with remodeling of the pituitary gland. The patient was diagnosed as primary empty sella syndrome associated with benign intracranial hypertension. The complaints did not subside for six months. The patient was treated via the transsphenoidal approach. The dura mater of the floor of the sella was elevated by extradural balloon expansion filled with silicone, and subsequently the empty sella was obliterated. Her headache disappeared and amblyopic attack also improved. Obliteration of the empty sella with an extradural silicone balloon via the transsphenoidal approach seemed to have been effective for headache and visual complaints of primary empty sella syndrome which did not respond to medical therapy.
