Multiple gestations remain one of the leading causes of morbidity related to infertility therapy. In the realm of assisted reproductive technologies, multiple gestations can be significantly limited by the reduction in the number of embryos transferred. Significant concern remains that a reduction in the number of embryos transferred may appreciably lower overall chances for pregnancy. Promising new developments are unfolding that may permit improved detection of a single human embryo with high implantation potential. One such development is the use of sequential culture media to allow prolonged culture of embryos to the blastocyst stage. We report a case in which sequential culture and elective transfer of one blastocyst was successfully used in a patient with a profoundly poor obstetrical history because of the complications of high-order multiple gestations.
