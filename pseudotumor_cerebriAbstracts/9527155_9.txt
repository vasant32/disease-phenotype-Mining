Forty one patients with the clinical diagnosis of Beh√ßet's syndrome from two teaching hospitals in Kuwait were studied. There were 34 male and seven female patients. Age at presentation ranged from 14 to 48 years. Neurological manifestations were present in 24 patients. Eleven patients showed evidence of increased intracranial pressure, and 10 of these had radiologically confirmed dural sinus thrombosis. Five patients presented with a meningoencephalitic or meningomyelitic picture, three with a stroke-like picture, and three with primarily brain stem signs. One patient developed trigeminal neuritis, and five patients exhibited (along with other features) variable degrees of psychological manifestations. All patients with neurological involvement were treated with steroids, and some also had courses of other immunosuppressant drugs and colchicine. The disease took a relatively benign course, except those patients with meningoencephalitic and meningomyelitic presentation, one of whom died from the disease. Those treated early had a better prognosis. The incidence of dural sinus thrombosis in this series of patients is unusually high. In most patients, the course of the disease was more favourable than reported in the literature. This may be attributed to early and aggressive treatment.
