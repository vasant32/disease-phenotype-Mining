Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with neurological complications in young children. We report an outbreak of EV71-associated neurological disease that occurred from February through September 1999 in Perth, Western Australia. Fourteen children with culture-proven, EV71-induced neurological disease were identified. Nine patients (64%) developed severe neurological disease; 4 of these patients developed long-term neurological sequelae. Neurological syndromes included aseptic meningitis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, opso-myoclonus syndrome, benign intracranial hypertension, and a febrile convulsion. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that immunopathology was a major factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disease in this outbreak. This finding is in contrast to reports of previous EV71 epidemics, in which virus-induced damage to gray matter was the most frequent cause of neurological disease.
