Two hundred thirty-one cases of neurocysticercosis are reviewed. Diagnosis was established by cerebral computed tomography during a seven-year period (1983-1989). One hundred and fourty-four (62%) presented with symptom-related disease (symptomatic neurocysticercosis and in 87 the diagnosis was incidental (asymptomatic neurocysticercosis). In symptomatic neurocysticercosis the parasitosis was considered inactive in 115 cases and active in 29. Seizures occurred in 135 patients (96% of the symptomatic neurocysticercosis). In the active form we also found: meningitis (n = 15), intracranial hypertension (n = 12), hydrocephalus (n = 10) and arteritis (n = 2). Treatment included praziquantel (n = 21), albendazole (n = 4), dexamethasone (n = 18) and surgery (n = 10).
