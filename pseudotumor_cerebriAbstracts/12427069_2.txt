OBJECTIVE: To investigate the localization of somatostatin receptor types 1 and 2 in human choroid plexus (CP) and arachnoid granulations (AGs) by immunohistochemistry. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in an institutional setting. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 15 samples of CP and 12 samples of AGs from 15 patients who died with no signs or symptoms of intracranial disease (age range, 52-81 years). The CP samples were dissected from the lateral ventricles and AG samples were dissected from the superior sagittal sinus. RESULTS: We demonstrated the presence of both somatostatin receptor types 1 and 2 in all samples of normal human CP and AGs. CONCLUSIONS: Analogous to their demonstration and to their function in kidney and ocular tissues, these receptors may be involved in the processes of cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, and may play a role in the increased intracranial pressure of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Somatostatin analogues have been used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a disorder of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Data are scarce regarding the cell-specific distribution of somatostatin receptors in normal human CP and AGs, the sites of cerebrospinal fluid production and egress.
