The diagnostic value of pattern visual evoked potentials has been assessed in a pilot study of 22 patients with proven or suspected multiple sclerosis. Of 7 patients satisfying McAlpin's criteria for diagnosing definite multiple sclerosis, 6 had delayed potentials. Four of 5 patients with probable multiple sclerosis, and 5 of 10 patients with possible multiple sclerosis, had delayed potentials. Ten patients with delayed potentials had no history of optic neuritis. Changes in the evoked potential with other neurological conditions that may affect the visual system are also described.
