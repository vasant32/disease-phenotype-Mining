Brucellosis is bacterial zoonoses. In endemic areas brucellosis can present with clinical features of nearly any neurological illness. Meningitic presentation is most common, with patient presenting with either acute or chronic meningitis. Pseudotumor--like presentation is also documented and accounts for only 4% of cases of neurobrucellosis. Here we are documenting a case of neurobrucellosis with presentation similar to pseudotumor cerebri but with abnormal CSF. This highlights the fact that being a potentially treatable condition brucellosis should always come in the differential diagnosis of neurotuberculosis especially if there are atypical features e.g. pseudotumor presentation with abnormal CSF.
