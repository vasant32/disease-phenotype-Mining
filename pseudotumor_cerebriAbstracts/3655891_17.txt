In 230 patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus, high-pressure hydrocephalus, or benign intracranial hypertension, measurements of the intracranial pressure (ICP), ventricular size, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow resistance (Ro) have revealed a linear relationship between ICP and Ro. It is shown that on average the CSF formation rate tends to decrease with increasing ICP. It is also shown that the size of the ventricles increases as the ICP levels off toward normal values. The clinical implication of this is that a small or normal ventricular size in acute or subacute phases does not preclude defective CSF resorption.
