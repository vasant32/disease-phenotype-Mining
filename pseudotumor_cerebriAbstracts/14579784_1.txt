Although cerebral venous hypertension is known as an important determinant factor for clinical manifestation and outcome in patients with dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM), the pathophysiology of that condition is not well understood. We have created a chronic rat model by cervical arteriovenous fistularization with jugular vein occlusion and examined effect of cerebral venous hypertension on cerebral blood flow regulation. This model may be suitable for investigating mechanisms of cerebrovascular alteration after venous hypertension.
