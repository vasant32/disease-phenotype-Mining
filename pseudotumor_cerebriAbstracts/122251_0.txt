In our Department of Neurosurgery, during the last two years, we have measured the intracranial pressure (IPC) with an extradural transducer, in cases of head trauma, subarachnoid haemorrhages, pseudotumor cerebri, dilated ventricles and microcephalies. We remark the importance of the continuous measuring of the ICP and its value in relation with the use of hyperosmolar solutions in the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of this patients.
