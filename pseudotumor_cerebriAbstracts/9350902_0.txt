Severe non-organic failure to thrive associated with physical and emotional abuse including food deprivation was diagnosed in a 9-y-old boy. Rapid catch-up growth (weight and height) followed change of carer. Recovery of poor growth hormone response to clonidine stimulation was associated with benign intracranial hypertension accompanied by headaches and vomiting. Possible mechanisms are discussed.
