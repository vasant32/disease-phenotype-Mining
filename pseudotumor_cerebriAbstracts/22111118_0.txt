 BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity has become a significant health problem for the pediatric population. The medical impact of obesity in youth is determinant. Conservative methods for weight loss are disappointing and therefore, bariatric surgery should be considered. AIMS: To present the experience of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents with morbid obesity, treated by the pediatric multi-disciplinary obesity clinic. METHODS: All patients (n=7, all female) participated in a weight loss program for at least 6 months without success. At referral, the mean age was 16.2 years (range 13.8 - 18 years), mean body mass index (BMI in kg/m2) was 44.4 (range 38.9-55.2). All suffered from various co-morbidities of obesity: type 2 diabetes, insulin treated (n=1), hypertension (n=5), fatty liver (n=2), obstructive sleep apnea (n=2) and pseudotumor cerebri (n=1). RESULTS: There were no intra- or postoperative complications. After a mean follow-up of 15.1 months (range 5-25 months), all patients but one had reduced BMI (mean BMI of 32.55). In all subjects who lost weight, remission or improvement of the co-morbidities was noted. CONCLUSION: In this study, with a mean follow-up of 15.1 months, LSG was proven to be a safe and effective option of bariatric surgery in adolescents, resulting in a significant weight loss and remission or improvement of co-morbidities. We suggest that LSG might be considered as a single intervention for morbid obesity in adolescents. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of LSG and other bariatric surgeries in adolescents.
