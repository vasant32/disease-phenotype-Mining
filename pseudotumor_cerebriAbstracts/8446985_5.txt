BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiphospholipid antibodies are known to be associated with increased risk of venous and arterial thrombotic events, including cerebral venous thromboses. Pseudotumor syndrome can be produced by cerebral venous thrombosis. A patient with cerebral venous thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid antibodies who exhibited pseudotumor syndrome is reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man who noted visual blurring and persistent vertical wavy lines in his fields of vision was found to have papilledema. Cerebrospinal fluid values were normal except for an opening pressure increase to 510 mm of fluid. His visual symptoms improved with lumbar puncture and the use of acetazolamide. Imaging studies showed that the transverse sinus was occluded completely on the left and partially on the right and that there was a small left cerebellar cortical venous infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Antiphospholipid syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pseudotumor syndrome related to cerebral venous thrombosis.
