We report a case of pseudotumor cerebri (PC) in a maintenance hemodialysis patient that was associated with thrombosis of the right and left brachiocephalic veins caused by repeated subclavian and jugular vein catheterizations. Symptoms and signs of PC appeared when a right forearm Gortex graft was inserted. PC secondary to intracranial venous outflow obstruction is an important diagnostic consideration for hemodialysis patients with headache, visual disturbance, and papilledema.
