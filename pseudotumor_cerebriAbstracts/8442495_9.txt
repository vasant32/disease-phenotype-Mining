This study was undertaken to understand better how damage to the anterior visual pathway may affect the relationship between the visual and pupillomotor systems. The relative afferent pupillary defect and the interocular difference in visual field mean deviation (determined by the Humphrey Field Analyzer Statpac program) were correlated in 137 patients. A moderate linear correlation (r = .66) was found. In 25 patients tested by both static and kinetic perimetry, the correlation could not be significantly improved by considering field loss outside of 30 degrees. The correlation was further studied in four subcategories of diagnosis: optic neuritis (n = 36), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (n = 26), compressive optic neuropathy (n = 14), and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (n = 7). In compressive optic neuropathy and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the difference in mean deviation between the two eyes was associated with a larger relative afferent pupillary defect than in optic neuritis and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In optic neuritis, the correlation was the poorest. These results indicate that diseases of the afferent visual system may not necessarily affect visual threshold (as tested by static perimetry) and the pupillary light reflex (a suprathreshold test) in the same way.
