Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a syndrome characterized by the abnormal elevation of the intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or hydrocephalus, and with normal composition of the cerebrospinal fluid. We report a case of BIH in a chronic hemodialysis patient with no signs of intraocular inflammation or neurologic abnormalities. Treatment with acetazolamide followed by corticosteroids failed to improve the signs of BIH. However, after correction of the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula of the left upper extremity, which demonstrated excessive flow, BIH symptoms completely disappeared. CONCLUSION: When managing BIH in a hemodialysis patient, consider the fistula.
