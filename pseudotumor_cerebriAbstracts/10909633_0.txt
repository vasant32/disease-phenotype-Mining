A 15-year-old girl, who had been treated with minocyclin for acne for 2 months, was admitted for investigation of headache, nausea and papilledema. A space-occupying lesion was ruled out by computerized brain tomography. The diagnosis of benign intracranial pressure (pseudo-tumor cerebri) was made because of elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure with normal biochemistry and cytology. Tetracyclines, especially minocyclin, commonly used for treating acne in adolescents, can cause benign intracranial pressure.
