We describe two patients with renal transplants who developed pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in the course of their follow-up. They illustrate the diagnostic challenge in such situations. Patients with renal transplants usually have many other associated conditions which may lead to headache, visual disturbances or papilledema. A high index of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis and management of this rare and serious but treatable combination.
