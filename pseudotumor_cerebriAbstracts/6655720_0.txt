Ten children with acute increased intracranial pressure, documented by the Cheek screw technique, were treated for Reye's syndrome, other toxic/metabolic encephalopathies, encephalitis, and traumatic encephalopathies. The rationale for the use of hyperventilation, head position, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, hyperosmolar agents, steroids, adequate fluid balance, and barbiturates in the therapy of these patients is described. An analysis of these cases reveals that early monitoring of intracranial pressure, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, and aggressive treatment of increased intracranial pressure may reduce the mortality of patients with increased intracranial pressure. Of all patients studied, those who survived demonstrated some neurological deficit as determined by clinical examination or neuropsychological testing.
