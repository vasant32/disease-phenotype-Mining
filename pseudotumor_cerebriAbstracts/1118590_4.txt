The relationship of the brain angiographic mode circulation time (AVCT) to the mean transit time of the vascular indicator C15O-labeled hemoglobin (tc15o) and the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by the clearance of the diffusible tracer H2-15O was examined in 38 patients with selected cerebral diseases. The results demonstrate a predictable relationship does exist between the rCBF and tc15o. This relationship is linear when plotted as tc15o vs. 1/CBF. Further, tc150 can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the AVCT to permit at least a qualitative assessment of rCBF from the cerebral angiogram.
