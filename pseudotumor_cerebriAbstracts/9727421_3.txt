PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of adapting confocal scanning laser (CSL) tomography of the optic disc for quantitative evaluation of papilledema in pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). METHODS: Confocal scanning laser tomography of the optic disc was performed in 11 patients with diagnosed PTC and 12 visually normal control subjects of similar age. In five patients with active papilledema, CSL tomography was performed serially over several months. To quantify optic disc characteristics, surface topography was measured in 0.1-mm steps along the horizontal and vertical meridians and four oblique meridians. Best fit polynomial functions, describing surface topography along each meridian, were derived using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Third-order polynomials provided excellent fits (significantly better than the second-order functions) to the surface topography for all meridians in the control subjects and patients with PTC. In control subjects and PTC patients an asymmetry in the slope of the optic disc contours was evident along the horizontal but not the vertical meridian. In patients with active papilledema a significant elevation of the center of the disc was accompanied by a change in overall surface topography. Each of the PTC patients followed up serially had a pronounced posterior deformation of the disc (i.e., a reduction in papilledema) that was initially apparent in the temporal meridian and did not proceed uniformly across all meridians. CONCLUSIONS: Confocal scanning laser tomography can quantify the magnitude and monitor the resolution of papilledema in PTC. Studies of optic nerve head topography may provide further insight into optic nerve compliance with elevated intracranial pressure.
