OBJECTIVE: Determine the influence of urapidil on mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean central venous pressure (CVP) and heart rate (HR) in awake humans without any evidence of cerebral or cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: Open, single-dose volunteer study. INTERVENTIONS: CSFP was measured via a spinal needle after i.v. injection of a single dose of 0.2 mg kg-1 urapidil in six volunteers (2 female, 4 male). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After administration of urapidil, CSFP increased from 7 +/- 1 mmHg to 10 +/- 1 mmHg (p < 0.05), MAP decreased from 88 +/- 7 mmHg to 74 +/- 5 mmHg (p < 0.05), CPP decreased from 81 +/- 7 mmHg to 64 +/- 5 mmHg (p < 0.05) and CVP decreased from 0 +/- 1 mmHg to -3 +/- 1 mmHg (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in humans with presumed normal intracranial compliance the administration of urapidil causes a small but statistically significant increase in CSFP due to a parallel decrease in MAP.
