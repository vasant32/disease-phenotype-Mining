Aneurysmal bone cysts in the skull vault are reported in two patients 7 and 9 years old, who presented with vomiting and headaches caused by raised intracranial pressure. CT showed the cystic lesion in the diploÃ«, with predominantly inward expansion. Fluid-fluid levels were seen on both CT and MRI; the latter also showed bleeding within the cyst. MR angiography showed compression of the superior sagittal sinus in the second case.
