In a case of benign intracranial hypertension with no apparent aetiology, cerebral scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal uptake in the left transverse sinus 24 hours after injection of the isotope. This sinus was seen to be thrombosed by cerebral angiography. On the basis of this case, the role of cerebral venous thrombosis in cases of "pseudo-tumor cerebri" is discussed.
