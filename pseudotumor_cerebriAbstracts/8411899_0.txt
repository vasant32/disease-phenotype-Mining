Benign intracranial hypertension-pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a rare disease in childhood. We report about our experience in five children with PTC, aged two to ten years. The main symptoms were headache, palsy of VI.th cranial nerve and papilledema. Neuroradiologic studies showed normal ventricles in four and a slit ventricle in one. Enlarged optic nerve sheaths were found in one child prior to therapy. The cerebro spinal (CSF) fluid pressure varied from 380 mm to 480 mm CSF. Four children received acetazolamide, one child dexamethasone. Permanent visual deficit did not occur in any child.
