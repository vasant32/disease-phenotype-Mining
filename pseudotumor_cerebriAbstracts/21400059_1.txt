 PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and visual outcomes of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in Chinese patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with IIH in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1981 to 2009. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory data, treatment, and visual outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included, seven female and five male patients. The mean age at onset was 32 (range, 13-65) years. Obesity was found in four (33%) patients. The most common clinical symptom was headache (75%), followed by transient visual obscuration (42%) and tinnitus (17%). Snellen visual acuity was equal to or better than 20/30 in 23 eyes, and the only eye with vision worse than 20/50 vision belonged to a patient who had been amblyopic since childhood. Visual field defects were detected in seven eyes by either Goldmann or automated perimetry. Generalized depression and an enlarged blind spot were the most common patterns. Ten patients were found to have bilateral disc edema. One patient with unilateral papilledema and one patient without papilledema were identified in the study. CONCLUSIONS: In IIH in Chinese, men are more likely to be affected than women, but obesity is not as frequent as reported in Western countries. Visual function outcomes are more favorable in Chinese patients.
