The case of a 16-month-old baby girl with craniosynostosis associated with venous sinus stenosis and sinus pericranii is reported. Monitoring of intracranial pressure indicated increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance in addition to increased intracranial pressure. Despite intracranial hypertension, however, the pressure-buffering capacity, expressed as pressure-volume index, was remarkably elevated. A similar case has not been reported in the literature. The mechanism of pressure-volume index elevation and the management of this anomaly are discussed.
