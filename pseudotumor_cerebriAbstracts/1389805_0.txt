Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate recognition and therapeutic intervention. The obstetric nurse must have in-depth knowledge of the physiologic changes occurring during pregnancy, the relationship between these changes and cerebrovascular accidents, and the pathophysiology of increased intracranial pressure to provide the most comprehensive nursing care. This chapter describes fundamental principles of intracranial pressure monitoring.
