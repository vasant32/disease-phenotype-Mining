INTRODUCTION: There are transient intracranial hypertension cases, recognizable by bulging fontanelle in infants and by papilloedema in children. We present our experience in benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) cases, excluding traumatic brain injuries, encephalitis and meningitis. RESULTS: Among the entire neuropaediatric database, with 10,720 children in 18 years, 31 cases had the diagnosis of BIH. Sixteen aged between 2.3 and 8.9 months (75% males), all of them with transient bulging fontanelle, and 15 aged between 4.4 and 13.7 years (73.3% females), all of them with papilloedema which was subsequently resolved. A total of 75% of infants had recently finished corticosteroid treatment for bronchitis. In the older children, there was 1 case associated with excessive vitamin A intake and 1 mastoiditis. Transfontanelle ultrasonography or CT was performed on all infants and CT or MRI in every child. Lumbar puncture was also performed on 7 infants and on 13 children. Infants developed favourably in a few days, and children did so between 1 week and 5 months, some with treatment. DISCUSSION: BIH usually has a favourable outcome, although it may take longer in children than in infants, but it can have serious visual repercussions, even blindness, so ophthalmological control is necessary. It is normally diagnosed by exclusion of other intracranial hypertension causes. MRI and lumbar puncture must be done on all children or infants who do not progress favourably. Acetazolamide and furosemide, corticosteroids, repeated lumbar punctures and optic nerve sheath fenestration should be considered in those who do not progress well.
