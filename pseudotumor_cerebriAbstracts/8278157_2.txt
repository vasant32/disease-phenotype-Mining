A group of patients with empty sella syndrome (ESS) and visual field defect with or without visual loss has been examined with standardized echography and ophthalmodynamometric examination. The optic nerve thickness has been evaluated with standardized echography; the pressure of the central retina artery has been evaluated with ophthalmodynamometric examination with or without compression on the external carotid. Our results point out two different pathogeneses in the ESS: vascular defects or irregular endocranial hypertension.
