BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Focal encephalitis may be associated with brain edema, which is often fatal. The control of intracranial pressure (ICP) is therefore crucial for further therapeutic strategies in space-occupying edema following encephalitis. However, aggressive treatment strategies such as hemicraniectomy have not been described in a larger series of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical course and outcome in six patients who developed severe brain edema associated with acute encephalitis. All received maximum medical treatment for elevated ICP, but with signs of brainstem compression emerging, hemicraniectomy was performed to control ICP. RESULTS: All patients had a very severe encephalitic syndrome and were treated over the course of weeks in the neurocritical care unit (NCCU). However, all patients recovered almost completely and showed only mild or no neurologic deficit when reexamined after 4 months to 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Hemicraniectomy should be considered in patients with severe brain edema following encephalitis as a potentially lifesaving therapeutic measure. Moreover, the initial neurologic deficit seems to have no impact on the long-term clinical outcome.
