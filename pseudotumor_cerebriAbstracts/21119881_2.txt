Aquaporins (AQP) are family of water channels found in several epithelial and endothelial cells, whose recent identification has provided insights into water transport in several tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Since brain edema continues to be the main cause of death from several CNS diseases, such as stroke, much of the interest in AQPs and their functional contribution to the water balance is due to their possible role in clearing edema water from the brain and in managing hydrocephalus and benign intracranial hypertension, suggesting that they could be targets for future treatments of various brain conditions, particularly vascular diseases. AQPs also seem to be involved in cell migration, and a mechanism of AQP-facilitated cell migration has been proposed where local osmotic gradients created at the tip of the lamellipodium drive water influx, facilitating lamellipodial extension and cell migration. AQP-facilitated cell migration was also detected in tumour cells, suggesting that it may have an important role in tumour angiogenesis and spread, and accounting for AQP expression in many tumour cell types and for correlations found between AQP expression and tumour stage in some tumours.
