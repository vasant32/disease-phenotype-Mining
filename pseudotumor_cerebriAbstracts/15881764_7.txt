Venous outlet obstruction has recently been reported to be a potentially treatable cause of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). In the English-language literature only 18 cases, all from the UK and Australia, involving the use of transverse sinus stenosis stent treatment for BIH have been reported; the youngest patient to receive treatment was a 17-year-old girl. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with headache, papilledema, decreased visual acuity, and diploplia who underwent successful unilateral transverse sinus stenosis stenting and experienced complete resolution of symptoms.
