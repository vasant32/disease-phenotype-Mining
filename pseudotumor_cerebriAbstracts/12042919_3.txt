INTRODUCTION: The wide use of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring has improved the management of patients with severe head injuries. The rare but worrying complications associated with the application of such monitoring makes the idea of a non-invasive method of monitoring very attractive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new non-invasive ultrasonographic technology was used to measure cerebral perfusion pressure in 27 normal volunteers. The average monitoring time was 45.3+/-0.2 min, and the average perfusion pressure recorded was 77.4+/-0.3 mmHg. No complications were reported during the procedure, which was performed while the subjects were in regular ward beds. CONCLUSION: The non-invasive character of this method could extend the use of cerebral perfusion pressure measurement to several other neurosurgical entities, such as hydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri, chronic headache, and spinal cord injuries.
