Ventricular volumes have been measured from CT scans of patients with benign intracranial hypertension both at initial presentation and at a later date. Volumes initially were smaller than normal, but at review five patients showed a significant increase in ventricular size. Persisting small ventricular volume correlated with persisting symptoms and signs and with persisting obesity. This supports the view that patients with benign intracranial hypertension have brain swelling and that obesity may be implicated in the pathogenesis, perhaps via a neuroendocrine disturbance. It is suggested that weight reduction may be an important component of treatment.
