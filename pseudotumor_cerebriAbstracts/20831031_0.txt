The occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and hyperprolactinemia related to a prolactinoma are extremely rare, and the link between these pathologies has not been examined adequately in the post-MRI era. We report a patient with a small intrasellar prolactinoma who also developed PTC. Magnetic resonance venography did not show any evidence of compression of the cavernous or any other sinuses. She initially responded to treatment with acetazolamide and cabergoline. However 9 months later, her PTC symptoms recurred despite a normal serum prolactin level and a mild reduction of the pituitary tumor size on MRI. She improved after a lumboperitoneal shunt. We conclude that the findings in our patient do not support an association between PTC and hyperprolactinemia or prolactinoma. However, the case supports the need for clinicians to consider the diagnosis of PTC when patients with small pituitary lesions exhibit raised intracranial pressure features.
