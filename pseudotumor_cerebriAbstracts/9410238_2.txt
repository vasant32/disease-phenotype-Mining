The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) is a new instrument to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the retina. It is based on confocal laser scanning technology. Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage. As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 21 patients suffering from optic disk swelling of various etiologies were included in a pilot study. Measurements were taken at six different time points. The maximum optic disk elevation and the volume of swelling were evaluated. Visual acuity and the visual field were determined, and fundus photographs were taken. RESULTS: A reduction in optic disk swelling over time may be demonstrated by both morphological parameters and correlates with improvement in fundus changes. The change in the volume of swelling is greater than the change in maximum disk elevation. The course of optic disk swelling differs between patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and those with pseudotumor cerebri. No correlation was found between our measurements with the HRT and functional parameters (visual acuity and visual field). CONCLUSION: The HRT is a good tool for the follow-up of optic disk swelling, particularly optic disk elevation due to increased intracranial pressure.
