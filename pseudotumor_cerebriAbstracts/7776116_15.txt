We report 13 cases of benign intracranial hypertension (IH) in children with growth hormone (GH) deficiency treated with GH in the United States. The group consisted of eight boys and five girls, 3 to 16 years of age (median, 9 years). The interval from starting GH therapy to diagnosis of IH was 2 weeks or less in six patients, between 2 and 12 weeks in four, 8 months in one, 5 years in one, and unknown in one. Seven patients were not known to have previously described IH risk factors; the other six had at least one factor each. All patients but one had headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual changes. All had papilledema, and cerebrospinal fluid pressures were elevated (> 250 mm H2O) in all nine patients tested. The GH dosage range was 0.17 to 0.35 mg per kilogram body weight per week (median, 0.30 mg/kg per week) for the 11 patients with dosage data. After discontinuation of GH and treatment with lumbar punctures and/or medications, signs and symptoms resolved in eight children; in two of these children signs and symptoms reappeared when GH therapy was restarted. In four patients signs and symptoms resolved while GH therapy was continued; one child was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt because of an arachnoid cyst, after which GH was restarted without subsequent IH. In the 12 patients with idiopathic GH deficiency the course of IH was benign, with complete resolution of all signs and symptoms. Because doses and scheduling of GH administration have changed since the introduction of recombinant GH, higher doses and increased frequency of administration may be contributing to the development of IH in some patients. We suggest beginning therapy at the lowest recommended dose, with gradual titration to higher doses, and the performance of routine funduscopic examinations during initiation of GH therapy and whenever signs or symptoms of IH develop.
