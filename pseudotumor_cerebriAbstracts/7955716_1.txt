We describe a 35-year-old woman with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had low grade fever and skin eruptions, but neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings. Antinuclear and anti ds-DNA antibodies were positive, and complements were decreased. MRI demonstrated diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on T2-weighted imaging. Mild bilateral papilledemas developed in the fundi, when her headache was exacerbated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 550 mmH2O. Cerebral angiography showed no cerebral sinus thrombosis. She was diagnosed as BIH secondary to SLE. Since RI cisternography revealed remarkably delayed absorption of the CSF, it was speculated that the CSF absorption by arachnoid villi would be probably disturbed in association with some autoimmune mechanisms by SLE. The subsequent rise of intraventricular pressure may result in retrograde transependymal flow of the CSF and the diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on MRI.
