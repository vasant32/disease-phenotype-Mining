BACKGROUND: Benign intracranial hypertension is due to an increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause. The initial symptoms, complications and associations with medical conditions are discussed. CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old girl developed symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension following reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Laboratory studies and head-computed tomographic scan were normal. Examination of the optic discs showed bilateral papilledema and the cerebrospinal fluid pressure was increased. The patient was given prednisone therapy 1 mg/kg daily initially, associated with acetazolamide, and removal of 25 mL of cerebrospinal fluid. All the symptoms resolved and the treatment was gradually decreased. The child developed no further visual failure. CONCLUSION: Benign intracranial hypertension with the risk of permanent visual loss is a complication underrecognized in children. All patients receiving large doses of the corticosteroids who complain of headache or blurring vision, particularly following a reduction of corticosteroid dosage, should have an ophtalmoscopic examination to exclude this complication.
