We describe the occurrence of postdural puncture headache (PPDH) in an adolescent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and its successful management with an epidural blood patch. PPDH is a very rare occurrence in patients with intracranial hypertension and is described as a paradoxical situation in the literature. There are only two previous case reports (in adults) of the possible association. A 15-year-old obese patient with a diagnosis of IIH had an uneventful diagnostic spinal tap using a 22G Quincke needle in the pediatric emergency department but returned 24 h later with PPDH. After a failed trial of conservative management, she had an uneventful but curative epidural blood patch with 15 ml of autologous venous blood and was able to return to school the day after the blood patch. Follow-up review by her neuro-ophthalmologist shows resolution of her headaches, considerable improvement in her visual field defect and resolution of papilledema. This is the first report of PPDH and its successful management with an epidural blood patch in a pediatric patient with IIH.
