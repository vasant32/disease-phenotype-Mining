OBJECTIVE: We describe three cases of delayed development of intracranial hypertension post surgical treatment of intracranial arachnoid cyst. It is rare occurrence and the management may pose a challenge.The aetiopathogensis of this condition is described with a review of literature. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective analysis of three male patients, two aged 18 yrs and the third, 45 yrs of age were analysed.All the three patients underwent surgical intervention for symptomatic intracranial arachnoid cyst in the form of fenestration of cyst and cysto- peritoneal shunt. RESULTS: All three patients presented at a later stage with new onset headaches following the initial management of arachnoid cyst. MRI and MR venogram ruled out any intracranial vascular pathology. Lumbar puncture and intracranial pressure monitoring showed increased intracranial pressure suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. For the management of intracranial hypertension, intracranial pressure monitoring, Cysto peritoneal shunt,Ventriculo peritoneal shunt and Lumbo peritoneal shunt were performed. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of delayed development of intracranial hypertension developing in this clinical setting is not clearly elucidated. When intracranial arachnoid cysts are treated, the possibility of future development this condition should be borne in mind. Delayed presentation with headaches in this category of patients should rise the possibility of intracranial hypertension.
