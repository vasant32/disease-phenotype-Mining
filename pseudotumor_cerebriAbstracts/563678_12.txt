A 31-year-old man, on routine ocular examination, was found to have bilateral papilledema. Neurologic evaluation confirmed elevated cerebrospinal pressure with no mass lesion and a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made. A tiny subretinal hemorrhage adjacent to the right optic disk was found to be secondary to subretinal neovascularization. Over the course of several months, the papilledema resolved. However, the neovascular membrane extended further toward the fovea and was subsequently obliterated with argon laser photocoagulation.
