Raised intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass or hydrocephalus (pseudotumor cerebri) has been described in association with many conditions including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Papilledema is often listed in textbooks as one of the neurologic manifestations in SLE. However, the occurrence of this unusual neuroophthalmological presentation is infrequently encountered. We describe 3 women with SLE and pseudotumor cerebri who responded well to corticosteroid therapy.
