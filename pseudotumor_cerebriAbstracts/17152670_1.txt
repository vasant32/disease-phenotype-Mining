OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The etiological factors involved in idiopathic intracranial hypertension are not easy to identify. This case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was associated with a capillary hemangioma growing in the lumen of the superior sagittal sinus. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old girl had experienced progressive headaches and abdominal pain. Fundoscopic examination disclosed bilateral papilledema and high intrathecal pressure, suggesting idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography as well as digital angiography, revealed a 3-cm mass protruding into the superior sagittal sinus lumen above the torcular. INTERVENTION: A capillary hemangioma attached to the internal dural wall of the sagittal sinus lumen was microsurgically removed. The symptoms resolved in several days and no additional treatment was required. CONCLUSION: A tumor growing into a venous sinus is a rare cause of venous outflow impairment and may generate the clinical signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This case emphasizes the importance of multiple complementary imaging modalities and the efficacy of a direct surgical approach, which allowed resolution of symptoms.
