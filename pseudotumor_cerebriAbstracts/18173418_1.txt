Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can cause severe optic nerve damage with irreversible visual loss. Heidelberg retina tomography is a sensitive and reproducible tool that can be used in the monitoring of optic disc swelling due to IIH. We demonstrate that the three-dimensional images produced are easy to interpret, indicate progression or resolution and improve the timing of intervention in multidisciplinary settings by facilitating communication between specialists.
