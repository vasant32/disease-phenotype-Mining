CLINICAL CASE: Craneal sinuses stenosis can appear in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Neuroimaging techniques revealed a right transverse sinus stenosis. As the pressure gradient between both sides of the stenosis was small and response to conservative treatment good, angioplasty was not indicated. DISCUSSION: Lateral sinus stenosis in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is prevalent. It is not clear whether these stenoses are the origin of, or secondary to, cerebrospinal fluid pressure increases. Some cases refractory to conservative treatment may respond to angioplasty with stent placement.
