Intracranial volume and intracranial pressure have been measured in 66 children with craniosynostosis, 48 boys and 18 girls. The premature fusion of skull sutures is assumed to restrict skull growth and predispose to elevated intracranial pressure. Thirteen children (20 percent) had raised intracranial pressure and demonstrated a significant restriction of skull growth. In this series, volume measurement alone, however, did not serve as a reliable predictor that the intracranial pressure was raised.
