A 4-year-old male child with hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is presented. His disease course was complicated by the development of pseudotumor cerebri (PC), as evidenced by symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure in the presence of normal cerebrospinal fluid examination and cranial magnetic resonance scan. The neurological examination was normal with the exception of the right-sided sixth cranial nerve paresis. His neurological course was uncomplicated with spontaneous recovery within three days. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature of PC complicating the course of HAV in a child.
