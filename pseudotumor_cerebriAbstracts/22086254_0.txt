 OBJECTIVE: To examine the dynamics of intracranial venous flow patterns in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). METHODS: Nonrandomized controlled trial analyzing the difference in cerebral perfusion in 13 IIH patients and 12 healthy controls using contrast-enhanced duplex sonography. In patients, an additional 3D gradient echo magnetic resonance venography (MRV) using a new technique was performed to quantify stenosis of the cerebral sinus. The cerebral perfusion parameters, including cerebral transit time (CTT) and time to peak (TTP), were analyzed. RESULTS: IIH patients had a higher BMI (29.3 [95% CI 26.4, 32.2] vs. 23.3 [95% CI 20.7, 25.9], p = 0.003) and an increased prevalence of headache, but all other clinical characteristics were comparable. The CTT did not differ significantly. The TTP was significantly longer in IIH patients compared to controls (8.5 [95% CI 7.6, 9.4] vs. 7.3 s [95% CI 6.3, 8.1], p = 0.04). Twelve of 13 (92%) IIH patients showed stenosis of the cerebral sinus. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report an altered cerebral venous flow in IIH patients compared to controls using a dynamic ultrasonographic technique. A simplified MRV technique confirms the high prevalence and reliable detection of venous stenosis in IIH patients.
