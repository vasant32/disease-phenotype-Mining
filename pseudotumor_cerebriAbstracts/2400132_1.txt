Central hemodynamic parameters characterizing cardiac contractility and peripheral resistive vascular tone, as well as blood aggregation ability, its structural and dynamic viscosity have been assessed by dynamic (disease duration up to 15 days) and complex studies in 28 patients with septic shock of meningococcal etiology accompanied by signs of meningitis. All the patients revealed signs of intracranial hypertension caused by the onset of acute hydrocephaly or brain edema. It has been demonstrated that on entry all the patients were characterized by the combination of low cardiac output syndrome and second degree high or low blood viscosity. In addition to endotoxemia, acute intracranial hypertension that enhances the afterload and blood viscosity abnormalities are involved in the development of hemodynamic disturbances. Over the whole observation period elevated intracranial pressure had a certain effect on central hemodynamics, changing according to the mechanism similar to that observed in Cushing's syndrome. In addition, central hemodynamics and blood viscosity are directly or indirectly (via affected CNS) influenced by Herpes infection developing on days 2 to 5 of the disease.
