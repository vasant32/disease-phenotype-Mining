Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a headache syndrome characterized by elevated intracranial pressure with normal cerebrospinal fluid content, normal cranial imaging, and elevated appearance of the optic disc. We report on a 6.5-year-old boy with complaints of headache and right esotropia causing diplopia. A lumbar puncture indicated an opening cerebrospinal fluid pressure of 28 cm H(2)O. The headache, diplopia, and esodeviation resolved after the lumbar puncture. However, at 2-week follow-up, the elevated appearance of the optic disc continued despite normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. A second ophthalmologic consultation revealed optic disc drusen, as also demonstrated by ocular ultrasonography. To date, two such cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this patient is the youngest with coexisting optic disc drusen and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
