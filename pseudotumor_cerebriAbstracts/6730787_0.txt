Angiomas and aneurysms of the intracranial space which are associated with an increase in pressure show a considerably worse prognosis than such diseases without an intracranial pressure increase do. In the connection, the occurrence of choked disks and haemorrhages in the fundus of the eye, are of particular importance. Paresis of the eye muscle are less important because in view of the neighbourhood relations they may also occur without an intracranial pressure increase ( paralytical type). Choked disks do not occur very frequently and are almost exclusively found in subarachnoid haemorrhages (apoplectic type).
