In 9 cases out of 400 children with intracranial hypertension no obvious patomechanism was discovered, though in 6 cases inflammatory diseases were found in the case history. The etiology of this interesting type of intracranial hypertension is still unsolved, even the unity of the our 9 cases is unproven. All cases improved following the administered therapy. We can confirm that no relapse occured, the patients were observed regularly.
