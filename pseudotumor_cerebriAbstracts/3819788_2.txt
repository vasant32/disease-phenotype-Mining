Chronic intracranial hypertension in the presence of hydrocephalus and/or arachnoiditis is a rare presentation of neurobrucellosis. The present case is exceptional because neither hydrocephalus nor arachnoiditis were present. Brucellosis was diagnosed by serological tests. The patient developed asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, violent headaches, explosive vomiting, bilateral papilloedema, diplopia with paralysis of the abducens nerves, left supranuclear facial paralysis and left hemiparesis. A skull radiograph showed destruction of the sella turcica. Rapid recovery was attained with the use of antibiotics. The pathogenesis of this intracranial hypertension syndrome with destruction of sella turcica is discussed.
