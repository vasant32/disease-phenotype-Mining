The authors analyzed sequelae of head injuries in persons of call-up age (16-23 years) using computer tomography. Neurological, psychopathological, clinico-laboratory methods, electroencephalography, rheoencephalography, echoencephalography and lumbar puncture were also carried out. The obtained data indicate that these subjects who sustained head injuries showed pronounced polymorphous posttraumatic disorders in the nervous system. These data should be considered in the examination of call-up age persons.
