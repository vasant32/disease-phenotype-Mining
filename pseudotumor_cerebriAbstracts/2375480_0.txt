This is a presentation of clinical progress and outcomes of pregnancy in 240 women with cerebral tumors (n-16) and pseudotumors (n-224). Etiologies of cerebral pseudotumors included inflammatory diseases of the nervous system (n-86), cerebrovascular disease (n-81), benign intracranial hypertension (n-20), brain injuries (n-19), late toxemia of pregnancy (n-13) and cranial malformations (n-5). The disease first manifested during the gestation in 103 women. Pregnancy aggravated clinical progress of preexisting disease in 96 (79.3%) of 121 patients with pseudotumors and in 15 (93.7%) of 16 patients with cerebral tumors. Delivery was normal in 124 of 298 pregnancies, premature in 30 pregnancies and operative in 25 pregnancies; 109 pregnancies were terminated by induced or spontaneous abortions. Ten women died before delivery.
