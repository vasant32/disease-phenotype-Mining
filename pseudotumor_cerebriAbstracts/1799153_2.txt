Out of 130 patients operated upon for chronic subdural haematoma, 9 presented with epileptic fits before surgery. 5 patients suffered generalized, and 4 partial seizures. The early operative results were very good, and follow-up lasting for at least 3 years revealed that 7 patients were seizure free, and only two of them continued with epileptic seizures. However 7 patients, who did not suffer epilepsy before the evacuation of haematoma developed epilepsy within the first year after surgery. The overall incidence of postoperative epilepsy was 7%. The authors suggest that the capsule of the haematoma plays an important role in the incidence of epilepsy after surgical treatment of chronic subdural haematoma.
