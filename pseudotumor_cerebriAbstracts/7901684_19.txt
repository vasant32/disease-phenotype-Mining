Tretinoin is effective in acute promyelocytic leukaemia in adults. Data about its efficacy and safety in children are limited. We have treated 9 children with tretinoin at 45 mg/m2 per day. Pseudotumour cerebri or hyperleucocytosis occurred in 5 patients. Retinoic acid syndrome was seen in 3 cases. 1 of 2 children who developed hyperleucocytosis, pseudotumour cerebri, and retinoic acid syndrome died despite steroids and mechanical ventilation. Complete remissions with tretinoin alone were achieved in 15 patients. All 8 surviving children received consolidation chemotherapy. Our experience with tretinoin therapy suggests that toxicity is frequent in children.
