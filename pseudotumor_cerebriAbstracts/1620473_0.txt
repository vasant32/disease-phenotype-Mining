Preliminary experience of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is reported. Fifty-three patients with BIH were observed. They were treated with antiedema non steroid drugs plus rachicentesis, with steroid drugs plus rachicentesis, with lumbar peritoneal shunt and only 8 with HBO. Each patient underwent HBO with 100% oxygen at 2 atmospheres absolute a day for 15 days. In all patients a gradual disappearance of signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure was observed. No lasting effect of treatment were seen after concluding therapy. The effect of HBO in the treatment of BIH has not yet been clarified, but the results can encourage further experience and studies.
