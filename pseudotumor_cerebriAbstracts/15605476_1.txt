Pseudotumor cerebri is characterized by signs of raised intracranial pressure occurring in the absence of obvious brain pathology. We present an 8-year-old boy with pseudotumor cerebri secondary to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The reported patient suggests a possible association between subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and pseudotumor cerebri and that subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be added to the list of disorders known to be associated with pseudotumor cerebri. Patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis might benefit from treatment aimed at increased intracranial pressure.
