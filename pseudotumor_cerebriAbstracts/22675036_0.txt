The Chiari I malformation is a congenital abnormality characterised by downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum into the cervical spine. It presents clinically most often in young adult women. Known ocular manifestations linked to Chiari I consist primarily of oculomotor paresis with cranial nerve VI palsy and convergence/divergence abnormalities. Papilloedema is a rare manifestation of Chiari I with a clinical presentation often similar to that of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. To highlight this unusual complication, the authors report a 64-year-old female who developed papilloedema as the only presenting neurological symptom resulting from a Chiari I malformation.
