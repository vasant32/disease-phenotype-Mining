We report two infants with pseudotumor cerebri associated with renal disease. The pathogenesis of increased intracranial pressure in this clinical setting is unclear, but may be mediated by one or more of the conditions commonly associated with pseudotumor cerebri, including sinus thrombosis, increased intravascular fluid volume, anemia, and endocrine disturbances resulting in abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The onset of pseudotumor cerebri also may be related to changes in vasopressin levels that affect brain water permeability.
