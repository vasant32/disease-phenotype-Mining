Treatment with acetazolamide for pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in a renal transplant patient led to an acute, but reversible deterioration in renal function. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms behind acute renal failure and acetazolamide are detailed. In summary, caution should be exercised in all patients with chronic renal failure who require acetazolamide. It should be avoided if possible, used in reduced doses when necessary, and coupled with a high fluid intake to avoid dehydration and/or intraluminal obstruction.
