Lumboperitoneal shunting is widely used for the surgical management of pseudotumor cerebri and other pathologies such as communicating hydrocephalus. Although it is a safe method, it could be associated with complications including subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural and rarely intracerebral hematoma. A 44-year-old female applied to our clinic with complaints of severe headache, retroorbital pain and blurred vision. Lumbar puncture demonstrated cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of cmH2O. A non-programmable lumboperitoneal shunt with two distal slit valves was inserted due to pseudotumor cerebri. She deteriorated shortly after surgery. Immediate cranial computed tomography scan revealed a right parietal intracerebral hematoma. Development of intracerebral hematoma following lumboperitoneal shunt is a rare complication. We discuss this rare event accompanied by the literature.
