Three patients with benign intracranial hypertension ([BIH], or pseudotumor cerebri) had verified increased CSF pressure and unilateral papilledema. One patient had slowly progressive loss of visual acuity until unilateral optic nerve sheathotomy was performed. One patient had spontaneous venous pulsation in the unaffected eye. The diagnosis of BIH must be considered even in the absence of bilateral papilledema.
