Atlantoaxial degenerative articular cysts are described in various situations like rheumatoid arthritis, dialysis, and fractures... and in the C1-C2 subluxations of degenerative origin. The treatment of these retro-odontoid tumors does not consist in excision of the pseudotumor but in the reduction of instability by cervical fusion. The procedures are varied and comprise neurological and vascular risks. We report a case of C1-C2 subluxation associated with a pseudocyst compressing the cervical spinal cord, which was treated successfully by transarticular screwing without wiring procedure. This technique has never been used previously in this indication. However, the peroperational risks are less important and the results are similar to those of the other procedures.
