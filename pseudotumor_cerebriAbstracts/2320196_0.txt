In 16 patients with possible disturbed CSF circulation longterm recording of intracranial pressure (ICP) was performed. In 9 of the 16 patients the disorder became evident after the application of an exogenous volume-pressure testing procedure. This procedure enabled a classification into a group I--disturbed CSF circulation (8 patients)--and another group II--normal CSF circulation (8 patients). During a routine Xenon-CT-CBF study all patients of both groups were given to 1 g acetazolamide (DIAMOX) intravenously. Before, during and after the administration of DIAMOX the epidural ICP was continuously measured. An increase in ICP was monitored in all patients. In group I the average initial ICP was 13.6 +/- 7.6 mmHg. The maximum ICP was reached within a time interval of 13.1 +/- 4.5 min after DIAMOX administration. At this time the mean ICP was 36.4 +/- 19.2 mmHg (p less than 0.01). The average initial ICP in group II was 6.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg. The maximum ICP was reached within a time interval of 13.6 +/- 1.1 min. At this time the mean ICP was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mmHg (p less than 0.01). In respect to the maximum ICP both groups were significantly different (p less than 0.01). Despite a considerably rising ICP up to values of about 50 to 70 mmHg in several patients of group I only 1 patient complained of being sick. Presumingly, an ICP elevation caused by vasodilatation would be better tolerated than ICP elevations due to other causes.
