We report six cases of perilymphatic fistula in patients who received ventriculoperitoneal shunts as part of their final mode of therapy. The last of our 6 patients actually received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt as her initial mode of therapy. All but one had benign intracranial hypertension. All six felt better (less disequilibrium, tinnitus, and pressure and occasional hearing improvement) after LP with removal of 15-20 ml of cerebrospinal fluid.
