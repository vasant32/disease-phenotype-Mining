ABSTRACT: We describe 2 patients with inexorably progressive pseudotumor syndrome (intracranial hypertension without mass lesion or ventriculomegaly) both initially misdiagnosed as having idiopathic intracranial hypertension and who were eventually found to have spinal leptomeningeal lymphoma. Neither had, at any time, any clinical signs of a spinal cord or root lesion. We discuss the possible implications of these observations regarding the diagnosis and mechanism of the pseudotumor syndrome.
