Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a recognized syndrome of unknown origin that conventionally has been diagnosed by excluding an underlying space-occupying lesion using invasive contrast procedures. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the head is a safe, accurate method of defining intracranial structures that were previously only discernible by invasive studies. Seven patients with headaches, papilledema, normal mental status, normal brain scan, and normal electroencephalogram had normal CT scans of the head. Patients suspected of BIH can be spared invasive contrast procedures if the CT scan of the head is normal.
