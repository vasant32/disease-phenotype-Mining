There are many reports on the disequilibrium syndrome due to dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure. However, they do not mention the findings of CT cisternography and MRI. We intend to investigate the mechanism of CSF dynamics in a patient with disequilibrium syndrome by means of these radiological examinations. A 31 year-old woman who had suffered from renal failure for 18 years was found to have prominent increase of serum creatinine (18.1 mg/dl) and BUN (127 mg/dl) 3 years ago. At that time, digital marking of the skull was already present by X-ray examination without other destruction in bone survey of the whole body. She was hemodialysed by the hollow fiber kidney three times weekly (dialysis time 4.5 hours, dialysate osmotic pressure 270 mOsm/kg H2O). Three months ago, she began to complain of severe headache, nausea and vomiting 2 hours after the beginning of dialysis, so that she was referred to Kosei Hospital. On admission, she showed exophthalmus, concentric narrowing of the visual field, optic atrophy and hyperreflexia in jaw and four extremities. After admission, she received hemodialysis therapy thrice weekly (dialysis time 5 hours, dialysate osmotic pressure 290 mOsm/kg H2O). At the same time, 200 ml of glycerol (contents of glycerin 10, fructose 5, NaCl 0.9%) was administered intravenously during dialysis, which ameliorated the symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Laboratory studies revealed marked decrease of serum creatinine, BUN and uric acid levels and osmotic pressure, and increase of blood pH at the time of postdialysis compared with predialysis. Manometric CSF pressure increased up to 310 mmH2O at the day without dialysis before the glycerol administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
