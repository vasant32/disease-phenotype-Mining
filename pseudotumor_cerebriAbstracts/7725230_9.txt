A 46-year-old extremely obese black woman presented with headaches, blurred vision, and visual obscurations. Her exam was notable for bilateral severe papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and lethargy. Her CAT scan was normal, and a spinal tap revealed a very high opening pressure. Although this patient's presentation mimicked pseudotumor cerebri, the lethargy and retinal hemorrhages were atypical. Her hospital evaluation was notable for elevation of the serum bicarbonate level, and she was subsequently found to have hypoxia and hypercapnia on a blood gas. The patient was diagnosed as Pickwickian syndrome, with obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment of the pulmonary problem resulted in dramatic improvement in her eye findings and her lethargy, and optic nerve sheath fenestration was not necessary.
