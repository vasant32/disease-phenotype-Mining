Computed axial tomography has made it possible to observe excessively small ventricles in a variety of disorders of the CNS. This finding is presumably due to non-specific and diffuse swelling of brain parenchyma, and is illustrated in cases of trauma, neoplasm, encephalitis, pseudotumor cerebri, metabolic disorder, and probable dilantin effect. It is likely that other causes will be encountered in the future.
