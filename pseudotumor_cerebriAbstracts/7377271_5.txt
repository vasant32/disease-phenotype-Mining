Automated (Fieldmaster) and manual kinetic perimetry were performed in 1,019 eyes with various visual disorders. tunder appropriate test conditions, automated Fieldmaster evaluations showed a 96.1% detection rate and a 4.7% false alarm rate for detection of visual field defects. Preliminary results for 168 eyes showed that sequential follow-up testing with the Fieldmaster correctly identified progression or regression of visual field loss in more than 94% (34 of 36) of the eyes with visual field changes. The Fieldmaster correctly determined no change in visual field characteristics for 99% (131 of 132) of the eyes with stable visual fields. These data indicate that the Fieldmaster is an excellent device for detecting visual field defects, and also has some capabilities for monitoring progression or regression of visual field loss.
