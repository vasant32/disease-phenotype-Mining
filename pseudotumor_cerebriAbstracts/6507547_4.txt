Two young women with idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri were treated successfully with lumboperitoneal shunts. Their shunts were removed electively several years later, following which there was rapid increase of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In one patient, rapid increase of intracranial pressure resulted in bilateral visual loss. These cases provide further evidence that idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri may not be a self-limited condition.
