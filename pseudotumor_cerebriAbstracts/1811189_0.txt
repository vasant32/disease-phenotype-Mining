In a boy aged 13 years treated since 8 years irregularly with chemotherapeutic agents for Hodgkin's disease suddenly signs of increased intracranial pressure developed. In EEG changes were found on the temporo-occipital area with prevalence of the right area. In the cerebrospinal fluid the cell count was 33/3.0, Pandy Nonne-Apelt++, protein 78 mg %, sugar 84 m %. Skull radiography in a-p and lateral projections demonstrated normal cranial bones and sella. Despite intrathecal administration of methotrexate and decompressing drugs the condition deteriorated and consciousness disturbances, vomiting and dysarthria appeared. After 19 days of hospital treatment death occurred. Pathological and histological examinations demonstrated metastases to the pons. The necessity is stressed of considering possible cerebral metastases in Hodgkin's disease.
