The coexistence of optic nerve head drusen and pseudotumor cerebri is a potential clinical problem since diagnosing only one of two clinical abnormalities in a patient may delay or prevent the appropriate treatment. To the best of our knowledge, only four cases of such coexistence have been described. We report three cases diagnosed as having both optic nerve head drusen and pseudotumor cerebri and propose possible explanations. The report draws attention to the need for awareness of this potential coexistence in order to assure proper treatment.
