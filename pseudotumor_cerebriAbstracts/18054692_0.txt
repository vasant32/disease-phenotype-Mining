We describe the cases of three children with encephalitis associated with Coxiella burnetii infection. Neurologic features ranged from status epilepticus and coma to headache and pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. Patients had good response to antibiotic treatment with doxycycline and recovered fully. Q fever should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with encephalitis, and routine serological testing should be considered, especially in endemic areas.
