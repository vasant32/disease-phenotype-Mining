Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains one of the most common malignancies of childhood. Between April 1999 and August 2004, 9 of 207 patients treated at a Tertiary Oncology Service for ALL presented with Intracranial Hypertension (IH). Seven of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). Four of the patients were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage alone and four required Acetazolamide. Two of the four patients who were treated with Acetazolamide required subsequently a lumbar-peritoneal (LP) shunt. One patient succumbed to his disease before receiving any specific treatment.
