The authors present their results regarding the use of a buffered solution of glycerol 30%-sodium ascorbate 20% (GLIAS) for the treatment of brain oedema and intracranial hypertension. GLIAS was perfused intravenously in 80 patients with several types of brain oedema. In every patients serum and urinary osmolarity, diuresis, main blood and urine parameters, and ICP were monitored. Following GLIAS infusion an increase in plasma osmolarity was observed, changing the average basal value plus 13.4% after 15 min., 10.5% after 30'. At the same time there was a reduction of ICP and improvement in cerebral compliance. In each case there was a decrease in intracranial hypertension and brain oedema without significant collateral effects.
