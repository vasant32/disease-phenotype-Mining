Pseudotumor Cerebri (PC) is an uncommon disease, that occurs without relation to genetic or familial factors; however, there are few reports of PC in relatives. Most of them report patients in the same generation, except one, that reports the presence of the disease in a mother and her son. Here we report PC in a man and his daughter, and we make some considerations about the possible cause of this familiar occurrence.
