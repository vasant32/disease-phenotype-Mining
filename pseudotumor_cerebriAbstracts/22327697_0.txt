 AIM: Low levels of hypocretin-1 (HC-1) have been associated with hypersomnia, obesity, depression, and chronic headaches. These conditions are frequently present in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and may be associated with abnormalities of the hypocretin system. The aim of this study was to determine HC-1 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a series of patients with IIH and to compare these concentrations with those in a control group with no neurological alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included a cohort of 26 consecutive patients with IIH who were mostly women (25 vs. 1) with a mean age of 42.5 ± 13.2. CSF samples were obtained from a lumbar puncture performed between 08:00 and 10:00 a.m. HC-1 was determined by a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using I(125) as the isotope. Samples of normal CSF were obtained during spinal anesthesia for urological, general or vascular surgery from 40 patients (10 women and 30 men with a mean age of 63.7 ± 14.8) with no previous neurological or psychiatric history, a normal neurological examination, and MMSE scores of ≥ 24. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between HC-1 levels in the CSF of patients with IIH (119.61 ± 21.63 pg/mL) and those of the control group (119.07 ± 20.30 pg/mL; p = 0.918). CONCLUSIONS: HC-1 is not associated with the clinical symptoms present in patients with IIH.
