Brucellosis is an infectious disease with multisystem involvement caused by the genus Brucella. Neurological complications including meningitis, meningoencephalitis, myelitis-radiculoneuritis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and meningovascular syndromes are rarely encountered. We present here a patient with sixth cranial nerve palsy that occurred during treatment for brucellosis, a form of presentation rarely been reported in English-language literature. We conclude that neurobrucellosis, pseudotumor cerebri, and side effects of tetracyclines which are frequently used in brucellosis should be kept in mind when considering intractable headaches and cranial nerve palsies in patients with brucellosis.
