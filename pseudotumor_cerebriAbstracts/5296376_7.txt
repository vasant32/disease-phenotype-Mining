Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a syndrome common to a number of disorders, is characterized by headaches and blurred vision. The patient is alert and has papilledema without localizing signs. Air studies show normal ventricles under increased pressure. The authors describe 61 consecutive cases of this pseudotumour, 48 of which were in fat young women, and propose that this group represents a clinical entity that has hitherto received little attention.In these 61 patients, 40 complete-exchange pneumoencephalograms showed normal ventricles, normal fluid volume and prominent cortical sulci. In 32, subtemporal decompression resulted in prompt and lasting relief. Three patients had late convulsive seizures after surgery. Seven patients had nasal quadrantanopsias, the implications of which are discussed. The authors believe that the high intracranial pressure in this condition is due to cerebral hyperemia, not brain edema. Further investigation will perhaps demonstrate a relationship between obesity, vascular dilatation and increased intracranial pressure.
