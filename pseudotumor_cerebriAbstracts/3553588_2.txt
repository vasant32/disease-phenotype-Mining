We report a young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by pseudotumor cerebri which resolved with high dosage corticosteroid therapy. The cause of the raised intracranial pressure proved to be thrombosis of the torcular herophili and lateral sinuses. Despite laboratory evidence of a hypercoagulable state, the presence of a lupus anticoagulant could not be shown.
