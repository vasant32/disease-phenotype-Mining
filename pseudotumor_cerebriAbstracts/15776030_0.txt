BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without a massive lesion or abnormal cerebrospinal fluid. Common symptoms include headache and visual disturbances such as transient visual obscurations or visual loss. Treatment may alleviate symptoms and prevent serious complications. In this study, we present 10 cases illustrating aspects of the disease including causes and treatment options. We also evaluated the effect of treatment and compared the incidence with other studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We registered all patients and reviewed the medical notes on patients with intracranial hypertension treated at Troms√∏ University Hospital over a five-year period (1999-2003). RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We identified 10 patients with intracranial hypertension; 6 of them fulfilled the criteria of the International Headache Society for idiopathic intracranial hypertension while 4 had secondary intracranial hypertension caused by medication such as oral contraceptives or tetracycline, or by surgical therapy. Idiopathic or secondary intracranial hypertension should be considered in patients with unexplained chronic headache.
