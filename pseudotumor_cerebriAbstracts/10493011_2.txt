The authors present results of optic nerve sheath decompression in 62 eyes. The decompression surgery was performed for progressive form of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in 25 eyes, optic nerve head drusen in 19 eyes, normal tension glaucoma in 7 eyes (+1 reoperation), chronic optic disc oedema in pseudotumor cerebri in 5 patients, central vein occlusion (CRVO) in 2 patients, CRVO combined with NAION in 2 patients, amiodarone optic neuropathy in 1 patient. Results of our long-term study enable us to suggest this method of treatment for vision-threating optic neuropathies after thoroughly balanced assessment of possible risks and gains.
