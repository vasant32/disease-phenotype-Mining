A very small fiberoptic catheter initially developed as an intravascular pressure sensor was incorporated into a system to be used as an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. 13 patients with intracranial hypertension have been studied with this probe. The clinical experience confirmed the safety, accuracy and reliability of the device. The monitor has functioned very well, and there have been no complications except for two breakages of optic fiber as a result of nursing manoeuvres. This new device can be placed into the ventricular, subdural and epidural space. Camino System appears to offer advantages over other monitors presently in use.
