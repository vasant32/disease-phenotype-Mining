The management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with an associated acute lung injury is difficult. High levels of PaCO2 as tolerated for permissive hypercapnia are deleterious for cerebral circulation. In such circumstances, tracheal gas insufflation (TGI), which was recently proposed to reduce PaCO2, may be of benefit. We report the cases of two patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome and head trauma complicated with elevated ICP. The introduction of TGI decreased PaCO2 by 17 and 26%, decreased ICP, and increased calculated cerebral perfusion pressure. We conclude that TGI could be added to a pressure-targeted strategy of ventilatory management when severe adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated to an intracranial hypertension.
