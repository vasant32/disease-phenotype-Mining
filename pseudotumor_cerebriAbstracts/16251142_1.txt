Isolated abducens nerve palsy is a rare complication of treatment with various drugs. Here, the authors report the case of a 23-year-old female with isolated left abducens nerve palsy after long-term retinoic acid therapy. The association is based on the temporal relationship and the exclusion of other possible etiologic factors following extensive laboratory and imaging diagnostics. The authors suggest that isolated abducens nerve palsy may be a presenting sign of a toxic neuropathy associated with retinoic acid therapy. After the exclusion of other organic lesions, especially idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio, discontinuation of treatment must be considered in such cases.
