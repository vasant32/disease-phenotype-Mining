The indications and the results of different surgical procedures for the management of intracranial abscesses are dealt in a cooperative study. Two series, amounting 68 patients altogether, collected in epidemiologically homogeneous areas with high percentage of rural population without adequate medical control, are appraised. Due to the high rate of chronic lesions, particularly in the pre-CT scan era (1968-1975), radical excision was required in 70.6% of cases. Overall postoperative mortality was 14.7%: 7.3% during the hospital stay, mostly due to pyrogenic ventriculitis in patients with large deep located abscesses, and 7.4% for different complications, both intra- and extracerebral, at home or other institutions several months after surgery. 29% of patients recovered completely and 45.6% have only minor disability, only 10.3% remained severely crippled and dependent. The results of the surgery, both in terms of operative mortality and functional recovery seem to depend on the neuropathological background rather than on the kind of therapeutic procedure implemented. Even though it must be acknowledged that at present conservative and minor surgical procedures are more often successfully used, radical excision still appears to keep far from negligible indications.
