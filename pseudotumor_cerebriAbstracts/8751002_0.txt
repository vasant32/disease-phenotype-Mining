Although Terson's syndrome has been diagnosed more frequently since the early 1960s because of improved intensive-care facilities, these reports are single case reports or retrospective studies. Therefore, we examined prospectively 20 patients (11 male, 9 female), aged between 23 and 77 years, with subarachnoid hemorrhages or rapid increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) of other origin (tumor-associated, post-traumatic) to evaluate ocular changes. In all patients the increase in ICP was confirmed by computed tomography. Additionally, in 16 patients permanent monitoring of ICP was performed. Twelve patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 6 had a post-traumatic increase in ICP, and 2 more presented with a tumor-associated intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 8 patients (40%) presented with intraocular changes; 6 presented with uni- or bilateral intraretinal hemorrhage, 1 patient had a bilateral papilledema and 1 more patient had bilateral vitreal hemorrhage. When ocular hemorrhage occurred, the mortality was 2.5 times as high as in patients without ocular hemorrhage. For this prognostic feature of the ophthalmological status all patients with rapid increase in ICP should be monitored early for intraocular hemorrhage. The possibility of intraocular hemorrhage is elevated in high-degree subarachnoid hemorrhage, whereas a rapid increase in ICP also found when the pressure has other causes (tumor-associated, posttraumatic).
