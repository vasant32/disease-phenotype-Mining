We treated two patients with Crohn's disease and one patient with ulcerative colitis who developed headache, papilledema, and intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) during corticosteroid withdrawal. One had four separate episodes with corticosteroid withdrawal, which suggested a causal relationship. This association between pseudotumor cerebri and corticosteroid withdrawal has been documented in children, but is rare in adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
