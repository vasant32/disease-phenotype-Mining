The authors have studied the effect of acute intracranial hypertension produced by placement of an epidural balloon (control group) in cats, on cerebral perfusion, evoked responses, and hematological parameters. These elements were measured in similarly injured animals which underwent isovolemic hemodilution with dextran 75, after relief of intracranial hypertension. Four hours after balloon deflation, perfusion was markedly impaired in 30% of the control group, and was reduced to 11% in the dextran-infused group. The suppressed N1 amplitude of somatosensory evoked responses on the compression side, the reduced platelet aggregability, and the erythrocyte-deformability by intracranial hypertension were all significantly more restored in the dextran-infused group after decompression. The percentage of platelets with volumes between 21.75 and 48.75 cu mu (normal 9.75 to 12.75 cu mu) significantly increased after decompression. Activation of platelets during intracranial hypertension leads to an increase in platelet volume from platelet aggregation, and correlates with a decrease in platelet aggregability. It was also suggested that reduction of erythrocyte deformability was not caused by erythrocyte aggregation. The authors emphasize the role of intravascular factors such as vascular obstruction by platelet aggregates, and difficulty in passage of erythrocytes through capillaries due to reduced deformability, in the disturbance of the microcirculation following acute intracranial hypertension. The protective effect of dextran 75 by inhibition of platelets as well as hemodilution is stressed.
