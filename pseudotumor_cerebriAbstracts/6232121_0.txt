Isotretinoin is remarkably effective in the treatment of severe cystic acne, however, many complications have been observed during treatment and new toxic effects have been reported. Hypertriglyceridemia associated with decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol has occurred in 25 percent of patients and requires monitoring during treatment. Painful erosions with granulation tissue recently have been reported in patients with severe acne. Other complications have included corneal opacities, pseudotumor cerebri, hypercalcemia, photosensitivity reactions, abnormal liver function tests, and skeletal hyperostosis. Isotretinoin is teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy. With the increasing acceptance and use of isotretinoin for cystic acne, as well as related disorders (inflammatory papulopustular acne with scarring, gram-negative folliculitis, and acne rosacea), a reevaluation of isotretinoin aimed at reducing complications is in order. Patient selection criteria and guidelines directed at reducing these complications are presented.
