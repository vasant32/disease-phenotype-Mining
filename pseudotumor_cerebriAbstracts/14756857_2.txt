Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and low cerebrospinal pressure are 2 conditions that are thought to be on opposite ends of the cerebrospinal pressure spectrum. Headache is the prominent component of both conditions. We describe a patient whose evaluation for idiopathic intracranial hypertension resulted in a postlumbar puncture headache. Although not entirely intuitive, we suggest that the 2 conditions can be present in the same patient.
