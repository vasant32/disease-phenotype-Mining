PURPOSE: To report a case of papilledema and pseudotumor cerebri developed in association with Sjögren's syndrome. METHODS: Case-report of a 38-year-old woman with history, imaging and histology confirming the diagnosis of both pseudotumor cerebri and Sjögren's syndrome who presented with bilateral decrease of vision. RESULTS: Papilledema associated with pseudotumor cerebri was observed in both eyes. The patient's visual acuity improved transiently with the administration of intravenous steroids and cyclophosphamide; subsequently she needed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. CONCLUSION: Sjögren's syndrome should be considered in the different etiologies of pseudotumor cerebri. The major improvement with corticosteroids and ventriculoperitoneal shunt makes prompt diagnosis essential.
