The case is reported of a 41 year old white woman who developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) seven years after primary Sjögren's syndrome and four years after the association of Sjögren's syndrome with Jaccoud's arthritis. The SLE was detected by a benign intracranial hypertension, which is a rare neuro-ophthalmic presentation of lupus. No associated conditions linked to benign intracranial hypertension syndrome were seen in this patient and the hypertension syndrome recurred one year later.
