The authors present a 37-year-old lady with symptoms and signs suggestive of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). Routine CT and MRI scans were normal. Further investigations were performed with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and cerebral venography. These revealed obstruction of the right transverse sinus with high pressure (40 mmHg) proximal to the obstruction and low pressure (15 mmHg) distally. She was treated by transvenous stent deployment with resolution of her symptoms and the bilateral papilloedema. Evaluation of the cerebral venous system with MRV and or with formal cerebral venography should be included in routine investigations of patients with suspected BIH.
