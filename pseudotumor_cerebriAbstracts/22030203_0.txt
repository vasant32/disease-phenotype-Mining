Point-of-care ocular ultrasonography is emerging as a powerful tool to evaluate emergency department (ED) patients at risk for ophthalmologic and intracranial pathology.We present cases of 3 patients in whom optic disc swelling was identified using ocular ultrasound. Causes for optic disc swelling in our patients included idiopathic intracranial hypertension, secondary syphilis, and malignant hypertension with associated hypertensive retinopathy. Because direct visualization of the optic disc may be challenging in an ED setting, ultrasound examination of the optic disc may represent an important adjunct to fundoscopy when assessing patients with headache or visual complaints.
