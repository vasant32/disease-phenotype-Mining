Pseudotumor cerebri is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial tumor. It is most frequently diagnosed in obese young women, but it is also reported in children of all age groups, including infants. A variety of medical conditions have been suggested as possible etiologic factors, including several infectious diseases. This study presents a child with pseudotumor cerebri as the only presenting symptom of acute frontal sinusitis. The possible association between these two conditions should be investigated in cases of pseudotumor cerebri to enable the appropriate treatment.
