A 73-year-old woman underwent routine enucleation for a blind, painful eye related to end-stage diabetic retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma. A large cystoid space, in continuity with the optic nerve stump, formed around the implant in the first few weeks following surgery. Aspirated contents were positive for Î²-2 transferrin, confirming cerebrospinal fluid origin. Multiple comorbidities delayed surgical intervention, but the condition was ultimately managed with exposure of the patent optic nerve sheath at the compartment's base, temporary control of cerebrospinal fluid leakage with pulmonary hyperventilation and topical fibrin glue, dissection and vascular-clip ligation of the nerve stump, and capping with a dermis-fat graft. To the authors' knowledge, this postenucleation entity has not been previously described, and asymptomatic idiopathic intracranial hypertension may have been an underlying factor.
