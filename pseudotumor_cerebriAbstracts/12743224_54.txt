OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and nature of sinovenous obstruction in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) using auto-triggered elliptic-centric-ordered three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR venography (ATECO MRV). METHODS: In a prospective controlled study, 29 patients with established IIH as well as 59 control patients underwent ATECO MRV. In a randomized blinded fashion, three readers evaluated the images. Using a novel scoring system, each reader graded the degree of stenosis seen in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of each patient. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement across the three readers for application of the grading system. Substantial bilateral sinovenous stenoses were seen in 27 of 29 patients with IIH and in only 4 of 59 control patients. CONCLUSION: Using ATECO MRV and a novel grading system for quantifying sinovenous stenoses, the authors can identify IIH patients with sensitivity and specificity of 93%.
