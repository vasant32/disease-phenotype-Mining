Using a comprehensive psychoneurological examination including a number of paraclinical methods (EEG, REG, echoventriculometry, thromboelastography, audiography, etc.) the authors studied 160 war veterans who had sustained a closed craniocerebral injury of a mild or moderate degree during the Great Patriotic War. The following neuropathological syndromes most characteristic for its long-term period were identified: cochleo-vestibular disorders, oculomotor and optico-vestibular disorders, as well as vegetovascular, hypothalamic, Parkinsonism, dyssomnic, epileptic and hydrocephalohypertensive syndromes. The authors also describe a number of the features of these syndromes related to the type of the course of the long-term period of the injury and to the predominance in the clinical picture of the disease of posttraumatic or cerebrovascular disturbances.
