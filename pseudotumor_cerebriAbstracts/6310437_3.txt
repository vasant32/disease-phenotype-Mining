A 7-year-old girl presented with the physical and endocrinological stigmata of Cushing's disease. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary microadenoma was excised. Three weeks after trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy, the patient developed benign intracranial hypertension. Although ACTH levels had decreased to normal, the serum cortisol had fallen to subnormal levels. The child responded to exogenous steroid therapy, which was gradually tapered and discontinued after 5 months. Normal pituitary and adrenal functions persist 2 years later.
