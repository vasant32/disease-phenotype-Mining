Pseudotumor cerebri is a neurological condition in which patients develop headaches and visual loss that may not be successfully treated with medication. In these cases surgery is indicated, and decompression of the optic nerve is the preferred surgical procedure. We report a case of decompression of the optic nerve performed through an endonasal endoscopic approach in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri where enhancement of visual acuity was successful. To our knowledge, no previous investigators have reported this approach to treat pseudotumor cerebri.
