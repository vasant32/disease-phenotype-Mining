Four patients with hydrocephalus secondary to neurocysticercosis, were evaluated making a comparative analysis of their pre- and post-operative state. The results showed that intracranial hypertension "per se" does not generate changes in the hypothalamopituitary axis function. The cortisol response to its appropriate stimulus was subnormal indicating that the intracranial hypertension affects the adrenocorticotrophic or the ACTH system.
