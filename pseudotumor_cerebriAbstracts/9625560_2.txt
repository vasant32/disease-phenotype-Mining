PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of hypovitaminosis A with bilateral papilledema and flecked retina that regressed after restoration of vitamin A deficiency. METHOD: Case report. A 27-year-old woman had undergone a biliopancreatic bypass for obesity in 1990. In 1995, she presented with bilateral xerophthalmia, bilateral papilledema, and bilateral flecked retina. RESULTS: Laboratory tests demonstrated low serum levels of vitamin A (0.8 micromol/l) and vitamin E (8.54 micromol/l). Xerophthalmia, papilledema, and flecked retina disappeared after restoration of normal vitamin A blood levels. CONCLUSION: Hypovitaminosis A after biliopancreatic bypass for obesity may be associated with xerophthalmia, pseudotumor cerebri, and flecked retina.
