A cohort of 39 patients with confirmed raised intracranial pressure was investigated. Of these patients, 24 (62%) complained of tinnitus and 11 (28%) suffered from paroxysmal rotary vertigo. Intracranial hypertension can occur without the usual headache and visual symptoms. In such cases, the patient may be referred to the otolaryngological clinic and the condition may be mistaken for Meni√®re's disease or a labyrinthine disorder. The Tympanic Membrane Displacement (TMD) technique now provides a non-invasive method of monitoring the intracranial and perilymphatic pressures. This study provides recommendations for the use of TMD techniques in the otolaryngological clinic for screening, diagnosing and monitoring treatment of patients presenting with raised perilymphatic pressure.
