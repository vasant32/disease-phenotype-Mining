We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with progressive visual loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a perioptic subarachnoidal space dilatation. In this case, a clear differentiation between pseudotumour cerebri and optic hydrops was not possible. Administration of acetazolamid, furosemid and corticosteroids did not show any success. Progressive loss of visual function was halted with ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. We discuss MRI findings, aetiology and course of the disease, and its literature.
