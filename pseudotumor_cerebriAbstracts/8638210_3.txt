We describe a patient with pseudotumor cerebri for which a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt was placed. After a pseudomeningocele was noted at the lumbar incision site, an LP shunt revision was done, at which time migration of the catheter into the thecal sac was noted. Three months later, radiologic studies revealed cranial migration of the LP shunt into the posterior fossa. We believe no similar complication has been reported.
