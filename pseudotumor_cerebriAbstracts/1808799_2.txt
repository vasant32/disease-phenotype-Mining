A transcranial Doppler sonographic system with a special 2-MHz probe for prolonged experimentation has been developed for Doppler waveform recordings from the basilar artery on rabbits. Measurements were made from the maximum velocity wave form, and Pourcelot's resistance index was used to express the results. The diastolic flow, similar to that observed in humans in physiological conditions, decreases with increased intracranial pressure during chronic intracranial hypertension. This Doppler model may be valuable for assessing rapid changes of cerebral blood flow in conscious animals during prolonged or acute experimental procedures.
