Previously, the authors reported that objective pulsatile tinnitus can be the major or only manifestation of benign intracranial hypertension. This report updates the authors' experience with 31 patients managed over the past 7 years. Benign intracranial hypertension should be suspected in all patients with pulsatile-objective tinnitus, especially when the patient is a young, obese female with headaches and/or visual disturbances. Papilledema and small ventricles or an empty sella on computerized tomography are almost diagnostic. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated spinal fluid pressure on lumbar puncture. In such patients, angiography is not indicated. Furosemide and acetazolamide are very effective. Ligation of the internal jugular vein is contraindicated.
