A 42-year-old man with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and chronic papilledema had severe visual loss in his left eye caused by subretinal bleeding from a peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM). After optic nerve sheath fenestration in his left eye, the papilledema improved, allowing improved visualization of the CNVM. Visual function did not improve after the surgery. CNVM can complicate chronic papilledema and account for sudden worsening of vision. The appropriate management of this type of CNVM is unresolved.
