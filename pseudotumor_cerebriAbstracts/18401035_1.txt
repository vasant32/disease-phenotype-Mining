The purpose of this research was to evaluate the association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and behavior, attention, and learning abilities in children. Parents of school-age children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were asked to fill out a questionnaire and to rank the child's behavioral patterns before and after the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The questionnaire was based on Conners' test. Ten children were included in the study. Mean age at diagnosis was 11.5 years. Mean follow-up time was 25 months. Six patients (60%) met the definition of attention- and concentration-deficit disorders before diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension; 1 patient was treated with methylphenidate (Ritalin) before referral to eye examination. After the diagnosis was made and treatment was established, 5 patients (83%) reported an improvement in their attention and behavior. Of these 6 patients, 2 (33%) reported marked improvement. We conclude that attention- and concentration-deficit disorder might be an early sign for pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in these children may improve the child's behavior, attention, and achievements in school, without the need to resort to other modes of therapy.
