Vascular anomalies, extracranial and intracranial arteriovenous malformations as well as glomus jugulare tumour are well known causes of pulsatile tinnitus. Of late, benign intracranial hypertension has been stated to be a more common cause. However, tinnitus arising from and within the internal jugular vein has been reported only infrequently. Previously known as cephalic bruit and essential objective tinnitus, the venous hum tinnitus presents as pulse synchronous unilateral objective tinnitus. Ligation of the internal jugular vein appears to be a successful treatment. Two cases are presented.
