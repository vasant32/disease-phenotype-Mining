Cerebral Metastases are diagnosed in approximately 20-30% of patients with primary tumours. Because of the improvement of central nervous system imagining technology and of the newly effective therapeutic schemes, the incidence of this particular type of cerebral lesion tends to increase. In this retrospective study the authors review the patients admitted in the Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medicine departments and in the outpatient chemotherapy consultation, with a diagnosis of cerebral metastases. Sex and age, neurologic symptoms at presentation, neuroradiologic findings, primary tumour origin, treatment outcomes and prognosis were evaluated in this population.
