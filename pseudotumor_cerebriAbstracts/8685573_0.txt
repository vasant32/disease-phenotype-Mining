A 62-year-old patient complained about slowly increasing, intermittent vision disorders. Ophthalmologic investigation revealed choked disks in both eyes. A neurologic investigation performed thereafter disclosed increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure without recognizable cause. Internistic investigation was inconspicious; in particular, there were no indications for a systemic disease. The distinct findings of choked disks on both sides and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure without detectable organic causes finally lead to the diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri. Not until the nerve sheath of the right optic nerve was split did the visual field defects in the right eye diminish. Splitting of the left optic nerve sheath is planned.
