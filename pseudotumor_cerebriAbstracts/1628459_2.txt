A 10-year-old girl had complained of headache, vomiting and blurred vision for one month before admission to our hospital. Her neurological findings were normal, except that the examination of the fundi revealed papilledema. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure was elevated to 220 mmH2O. The brain MRI showed bilateral and approximately symmetrical hyperintense areas located in the thalamus. These disappeared on the repeated MRI, and her symptoms regressed spontaneously within a month. Her illness was diagnosed as benign intracranial hypertension because of the favorable clinical course. These reversible thalamic lesions might be due to circulatory insufficiency associated with intracranial hypertension.
