A 9-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease who was receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) presented with acute visual loss and was found to have papilledema. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal. The lumbar puncture opening pressure was 290 mm of water so the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) was entertained. Medical treatment was not an option because of renal insufficiency; neither was lumbo-peritoneal shunting, because of the peritoneal dialysis. After a lumbo-pleural shunt was placed, there was marked improvement in symptoms. The lumbo-pleural shunt is a reasonable option for treatment for PTC in patients on CAPD who require a CSF divergence procedure.
