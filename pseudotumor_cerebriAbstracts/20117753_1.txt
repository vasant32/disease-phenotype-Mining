Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or imaging evidence of intracranial pathology. The classic symptoms include headache, nausea, and vomiting. It may also be associated with blurry vision, diplopia, stiff neck, increasing head size, photophobia, anorexia, retro-orbital pain, lightheadedness, myalgia, and head tilt. Sixth nerve palsy is documented in 10-40% of patients with pseudotumor cerebri, in most series, but third nerve palsy is very rarely associated with pseudotumor cerebri. Described here is the novel case of a pseudotumor cerebri patient who had bilateral partial oculomotor palsy with sparing of the pupillary fibers.
