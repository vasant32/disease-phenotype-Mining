We reviewed 11 pregnancies complicated by pseudotumor cerebri over a 6-year period for an incidence of approximately 1 in 870 births. No pregnancy was adversely affected, but symptoms of pseudotumor increased in 9 of 11 pregnancies. All patients were managed medically, 9 of 11 with analgesics and diuretics. Two cases required steroid therapy.
