Does increased intracranial pressure in patients with pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) result in cognitive impairments? The results of previous investigations have not clarified this question. It may be that there is a subgroup within those diagnosed with PTC that does experience cognitive decline with increased intracranial pressure. However, elevated intracranial pressure, headache, and emotional distress also can contribute to reduced cognitive performance and increased self-monitoring. As a result of the lack of clarity regarding the impact of PTC on cognition clinicians are left with no empirically derived practice guidelines. A case study demonstrates subjective complaints of concentration and memory deficits in a depressed patient with PTC whose neuropsychological stores (except Seashore Rhythm Test) were in the normal range.
