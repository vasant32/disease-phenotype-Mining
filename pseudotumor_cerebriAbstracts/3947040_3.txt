An inverse relationship between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure and the corresponding protein value was found for patients with idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri who underwent their first lumbar puncture (LP) prior to the initiation of therapy. This relationship provides evidence for a pressure-dependent bulk flow absorption for CSF and also suggests that patients with high CSF pressures will have low CSF protein concentration.
