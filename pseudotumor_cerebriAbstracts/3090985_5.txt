In 15 patients fulfilling conventional diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri, anterior and posterior pituitary functions were examined. Eight of 12 female patients with pseudotumor were grossly overweight. Except for a subnormal response of growth hormone level to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in four patients, no major disturbances were found in pituitary, gonadal, thyroid, or adrenal functions. Vasopressin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was increased in patients with pseudotumor, whereas cerebrospinal fluid concentration of estrogens was below detection limit.
