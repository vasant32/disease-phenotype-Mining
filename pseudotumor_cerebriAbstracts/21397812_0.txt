We report a 14-year-old boy who presented with vision loss secondary to peripapillary neovascular membrane (PPNVM) as the initial and only symptom of papilledema secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension. After one lumbar puncture, visual acuity progressively recovered during the course of 1 week and further improved with the administration of oral acetazolamide. One year after the onset of vision loss, the patient's visual acuity had recovered to baseline measurements. The previously active PPNVM had involuted into a residual peripapillary fibrotic scar. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PPNVM complicating idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a child.
