Pseudotumor cerebri is a central nervous disorder with elevated intracranial pressure that is most common among young obese women. It presents with headache, transient visual obscurations and loss of central vision. Papilledema and visual field defects are frequent. Acetazolamid can be used for treatment. If medical treatment is not successful, optic nerve sheath decompression is recommended. Three patients were treated medically and there were treated surgically. Both methods stabilized or improved visual fields and central vision.
