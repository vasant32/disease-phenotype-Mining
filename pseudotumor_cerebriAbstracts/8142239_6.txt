The syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri consists of headaches, difficulty with vision and papilledema associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) without localizing neurological mass lesions. Recently, an association of pseudotumor cerebri and renal insufficiency, chronic dialysis or renal transplantation has been noted. Loss of vision remains a serious threat in children with pseudotumor cerebri. We report two children who developed pseudotumor cerebri with impairment of vision 5 years after renal transplantation. An awareness of this association should prompt the nephrologist to investigate and treat the symptoms of raised ICP to prevent visual loss.
