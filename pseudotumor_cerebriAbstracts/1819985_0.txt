Five patients were studied with the diagnosis of secondary hydrocephaly to neurocysticercosis. Valvular dysfunction was observed due to the obstruction of the ventricular catheter caused by cysticercus cysts. The Biomed System was used in four cases and the Hakim System in one. Valvular dysfunction was observed in patients within a period of 18 to 24 months after derivation, they also had a history of several valvular dysfunctions. The diagnosis was made upon extraction of the catheter where the cyst was found to be attached to the ventricular brush. Subsequent evolution has not been satisfactory. The reasons for this complication are of a hydrodynamic and pharmacological nature and are also due to the growth of the cyst. This complication is not often suspected, therefore we recommend that in cases of frequent valvular dysfunction and asymmetrical hydrocephaly, studies like iodine-tomography or magnetic resonance be carried out in order to rule out this factor.
