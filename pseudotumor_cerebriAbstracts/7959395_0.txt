Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, pseudotumor cerebri) was diagnosed in 4 patients who had been treated with tetracycline. The main symptom was headache, and in all there was papilledema. Symptoms and signs improved after tetracycline was discontinued and acetazolamide treatment started. When a patient receiving tetracycline develops IIH, the medication should be stopped as it may be the cause of the IIH, as appeared to be the case in our 4 patients.
