The pathophysiology of pseudotumor cerebri is unclear, but may relate to an abnormality in water transport in the brain. The authors performed MR imaging in seven children with pseudotumor cerebri; the signal intensity in the white matter was normal in all patients. These data suggest that periventricular brain water content is not increased markedly in children with pseudotumor cerebri. The authors speculate that this may relate to the establishment of an equilibrium between increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow and increased brain stiffness, occurring as a consequence of increased cerebral blood-volume and/or interstitial pressure.
