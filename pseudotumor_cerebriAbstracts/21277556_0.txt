Endoscopic surgical techniques allow treating various pathological diseases of the cranial base, including cerebrospinal fluid leaks (CSF). These approaches have a high success rate and reduce surgical time and morbidity. However, when they are located in the lateral wall of the sphenoid, the surgery is more complex. In our case, the CSF appeared to be related with a Sternberg's canal. Predisposing factors were also associated with an extensive unilateral pneumatization of the sinus and benign intracranial hypertension. The closure of the leak was achieved using an endoscopic transethmoidal transpterygoid approach for proper exposition of the lateral wall of the sphenoid. After five years of monitoring, the patient has had no more episodes of rhinoliquorrhea.
