OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sleep-related breathing disorders are common in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 53 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from a tertiary center neuroophthalmology practice were reviewed. Thirty-seven patients were identified who had a history of snoring, difficulty sleeping, or daytime somnolence. The data from polysomnograms were tabulated to determine the frequency of apneas, hypopneas, and arousals. RESULTS: Fourteen of 37 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and symptoms of sleep disturbance underwent polysomnography. There were two men and 12 women varying in age from 24 to 58 years (mean, 39.4 +/- 11.9). These patients were obese with body mass indexes varying from 33.0 to 63.2 (mean, 46.0 +/- 9.5). A diagnosis of sleep apnea was made in six and upper airway resistance syndrome in seven patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-related breathing problems were common in our patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Obesity was common in these patients and may be playing a causative role in sleep apnea and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is suggested that idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients who have symptoms of sleep disturbance should be further evaluated for the presence of sleep-related breathing problems.
