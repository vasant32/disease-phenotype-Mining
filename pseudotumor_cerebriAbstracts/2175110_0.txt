Two groups of patients with abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics were examined. There were 40 children with the hypertensive hydrocephalic syndrome and 67 with active hydrocephalus that had occurred before two years of age. A study was made of the anamnestic, clinical, ultrasonic and computer-aided tomographic parallels of those conditions. In the first group, computer-aided tomography of the brain revealed a moderate enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid space. Two-dimensional ultrasonic examination of the brain via the open large fontanel also demonstrated the widening of the frontal cornua of the lateral ventricles and of the III ventricle. The second group children manifested an appreciable enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid system, while the occlusive character of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities required surgical treatment (drainage via the shunting system). A table of the differential diagnosis of the clinical and preclinical symptoms recorded in the two patients' groups is presented.
