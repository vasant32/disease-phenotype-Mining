OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of different diagnoses of headaches in the Headache Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (AmbCef-UFMG). METHODS: Cross sectional study with 289 patients consecutively attended to at AmbCef-UFMG. Headaches were diagnosed based on the criteria established by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICDH-2004). RESULTS: The average age of patients was 42.6 years, mostly women (86.9%) with less than nine years of education. Primary headaches were the most common type, with migraine found in 79.8% of cases, and tension-type headache (TTH) in 20.4%. Among the secondary types, the most common was headache caused by overuse of analgesics (16.6%), followed by less common types, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Chronic daily headache (CDH) was found in 31.8% of cases. CONCLUSION: This study confirms literature data showing migraine as the most common headache in tertiary care centers. The expressive number of cases of CDH and headaches caused by overuse of analgesics indicates that, starting at the primary care level, patients should be advised to avoid the abuse of symptomatic drugs.
