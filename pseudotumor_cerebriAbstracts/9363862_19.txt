PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) administered on an intermittent oral schedule with interferon-alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a) in children with refractory cancer, and whether the marked reduction in plasma ATRA concentrations observed with chronic daily oral dosing could be circumvented with an intermittent dosing schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three children with refractory cancer (stratified by age, < or = 12 and > 12 years) were treated with ATRA 3 consecutive days per week and IFN-alpha2a 3 x 10(6) U/m2 5 consecutive days per week, both repeated weekly. The starting dose of ATRA was 60 mg/m2/d divided into three doses, with planned escalations to 90 and 120 mg/m2/d. Because severe headaches have been noted to occur on the initial day of ATRA administration, only two of three doses of ATRA were administered on day 1 of each week. RESULTS: Pseudotumor cerebri or dose-limiting headache was observed in two of five patients older than 12 years treated at the 120-mg/m2/d dose level and in one of six < or = 12 years at the 90-mg/m2/d level. Other non-dose-limiting toxicities of ATRA included reversible elevations in hepatic transaminases and triglycerides, dry skin, cheilitis, and nausea/vomiting. One child with recurrent neuroblastoma had an objective response of 6 months' duration, and one with recurrent Wilms' tumor had histologic maturation of multiple tumors. This intermittent schedule allowed for exposure to relatively high plasma concentrations of ATRA on a repetitive basis. Following 30-mg/m2 doses, the ATRA area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased from 96 +/- 14 micromol/L/min on day 1 to 26 +/- 24 micromol/L/min by day 3 of drug administration, but on day 1 of the fourth consecutive week of therapy, the AUC averaged 110 +/- 16 micromol/L/min. The recommended pediatric phase II dose of ATRA administered on this schedule is 90 mg/m2/d. CONCLUSION: An intermittent schedule of ATRA administration appears to circumvent the low plasma drug exposure that is a result of the sustained upregulation of metabolism when this drug is administered on a chronic daily schedule. Based on the results of this trial, a phase II trial of ATRA/IFN-alpha2a in neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor using this schedule is in progress.
