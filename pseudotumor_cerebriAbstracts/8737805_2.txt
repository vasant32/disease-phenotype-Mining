A 6.5-year-old child who received a shunt at 3 weeks of age for triventricular hydrocephalus related to his congenital toxoplasmosis developed symptoms of intracranial hypertension and papilloedema. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated slit ventricles. The shunt device was shown to be patent on isotope transit study. Spontaneously the cranial sutures widened and headaches disappeared, but loss of vision occurred and did not reverse despite optic nerve sheath fenestration. We suspect that a rapid drop in intracranial pressure played a role in the pathogenesis of our patient's blindness. This possible complication should be taken into account when calvarial expansion is planned in a patient with an intracranial hypertension syndrome with papilloedema in the presence of slit ventricles and a patent shunt.
