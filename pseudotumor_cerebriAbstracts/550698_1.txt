Intracranial hypertension of uncertain origin is a distinct form of cerebral pseudotumour. Eleven such cases have been treated between 1965 and 1977. All of them recovered without any residual symptom in response to symptomatic treatment (lumbar puncture, dehydration, etc.). No late relapse occurred. Steroid therapy is considered unwarranted, even harmful.
