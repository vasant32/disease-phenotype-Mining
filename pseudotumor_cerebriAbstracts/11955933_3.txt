Acute ocular paresis, nausea, vomiting, and headaches associated with high intracranial pressure without obvious intracranial pathology are typical features of benign intracranial hypertension. We describe two young children whose presentation, initially suggestive of idiopathic or benign intracranial hypertension, evolved to comprise ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. This triad characterizes Miller Fisher syndrome, a clinical variant of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome that occurs rarely among children. In both patients, this diagnosis was supported by the clinical course and neurophysiologic findings. Plasma serology was positive for Campylobacter jejuni and anti-GQ1b antibodies in one patient and for antimyelin antibodies in the other. This report of two children with Miller Fisher syndrome presenting with intracranial hypertension adds to the findings for a similar patient treated previously, which raises the question concerning the possible role or contribution of benign intracranial hypertension in Miller Fisher syndrome.
