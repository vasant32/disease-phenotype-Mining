The results of a prospective study on the effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in patients with severe closed head injuries causing brain edema and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) are presented. 10 patients were selected and carefully analyzed according to Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores and severity of brain edema. The results demonstrate that DMSO rapidly reduces the raised ICP, increases the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and improves the neurological course and outcome without affecting the systemic blood pressure and patient responsiveness except only in one patient. We also point out that the rebound effect does not occur.
