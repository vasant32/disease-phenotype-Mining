The authors present results of optic nerve sheath decompression in 37 eyes. The decompression surgery was performed for progressive form of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) in 11 eyes, AION combined with central retinal vein occlusion in 2 eyes, low tension glaucoma in 7 eyes (+1 reoperation), central. retinal vein occlusion in 1 eye, optic nerve head drusen in 11 eyes, chronic optic disc edema in pseudotumor cerebri in 3 eyes, amiodarone optic neuropathy in 1 eye. Postoperative findings (visual acuity and visual field) are presented for each diagnosis. After surgery a transient double vision developed in 5 patients. We have not seen any other complications. Optic nerve sheath decompression is a controversial method of treatment for optic neuropathies. We advocate this method of treatment for vision-threatening optic neuropathies after thoroughly balanced assessment of possible risks and gains.
