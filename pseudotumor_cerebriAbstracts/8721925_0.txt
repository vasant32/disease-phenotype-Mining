Pseudotumour cerebri is the name of a syndrome characterized by headache and papilloedema, with normal cerebral CT/MR studies and CSF with a high pressure and normal laboratory findings. We describe four patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of this condition (including normal 0.5T MR studies). They all had cerebral angiograms showing minor abnormalities localized to the level of the superior longitudinal sinus. All improved on treatment with anticoagulants and steroids. In view of these findings we consider that in cases of pseudotumour cerebri without a clear aetiological factor, an angio MR study should be done, or if this technique is not available, a cerebral angiogram should be done, to exclude cerebral venous drainage defects.
