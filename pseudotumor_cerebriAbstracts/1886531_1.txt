Cerebral pseudotumour is an endocranial hypertensive syndrome marked by the absence of focal neurological signs, the integrity of neuroradiological tests and an increased liquor pressure with normal composition of the liquor itself. It is normally self-limiting but if endocranial hypertension persists it may severely affect sight. It may be idiopathic or secondary to a number of conditions. The authors report a case of cerebral pseudotumour following the suspension of corticosteroid treatment. The pathology resolved rapidly following lumbar puncture. The paper focuses on the pathogenetic mechanisms and the still undefined therapeutic possibilities.
