A case of benign intracranial hypertension associated with generalized oedema is reported in a normotensive pregnant patient with long-standing insulin-treated diabetes mellitus. Following treatment with bed rest, chlorthalidone and dexamethasone the condition resolved and a healthy infant was delivered. This condition, not previously reported in a diabetic pregnancy, must be differentiated from other causes of bilateral optic nerve abnormalities associated with retinal haemorrhages and oedema, including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic optic neuropathy, accelerated hypertension and cerebral mass lesions. Treatment is required to prevent permanent visual impairment due to pressure on the susceptible optic nerve of the diabetic patient and to avoid the metabolic consequences to both mother and fetus of poor nutritional intake due to nausea.
