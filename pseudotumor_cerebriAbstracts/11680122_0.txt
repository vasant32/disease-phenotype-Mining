Pseudotumor cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension is a syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without obvious explanation. Most patients are obese women at childbearing age. Symptoms and signs usually include headache, nausea, vomiting, edema of the papilla, visual obscurations and rarely palsy of the nervus abducens. The prognosis is generally good, but progressive visual loss and eventual blindness are major risks. We report the case of a 21-year-old non-obese young woman who developed pseudotumor cerebri while taking minocycline for acne therapy. Identical symptoms occurred upon inadvert rechallenge with minocycline for the second time.
