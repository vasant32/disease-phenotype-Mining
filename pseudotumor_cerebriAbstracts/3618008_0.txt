104 patients of our clinic suffering from intra-cranial space-occupying cerebral processes were treated in the postoperative phase with a cerebral-pressure dependent automatic system for the control of the sorbitol infusion. On the one hand we compared the resulting long-term pressure behaviour of the VFP (ventricular fluid pressure) with clinical and paraclinical parameters and, on the other, with the consumed sorbitol dose. In this procedure advantages of the automatically dehydrating cerebral oedema therapy could be proved. Moreover, it was possible to find clear relations between the pre-operative general changes in the EEG, the degree of the cerebral oedema in the CT, pre-operatively diagnosed choked papillas and the osmotherapeutical expenditure in the postoperative phase.
