Case report of a 39-year-old woman treated by Danazol for a paroxystic nocturnal hemoglobinuria who developed benign intracranial hypertension and sclerosing cholangitis. Bilateral papilloedema cleared 4 weeks after Danazol was stopped. Twelve similar cases have already been reported in the literature. Danazol should be added to the list of drugs potentially inducing pseudo-tumor cerebri.
