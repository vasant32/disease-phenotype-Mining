Analysis of the findings of radionuclide cisternography in 34 patients with a hypertension syndrome of unclear genesis allowed 3 variants of an aggregate of radiological signs to be distinguished. The 1st and 2nd variants indicate diminution of the drainage function of the cerebral submeningeal space, which does not exclude the presence of a pathological process, one of tumorous genesis among others. The third variant which reveals open internal hydrocephalus (ventricular hydrocephalus) with diminished drainage activity of the submeningeal space of the brain excludes the existence of a three-dimensional pathological process, that of tumorous origin also. In hypertension syndrome of unclear genesis disturbed circulation of cerebrospinal fluid was always attended by its impaired resorption; not only a diminished reaction (function) but an accelerated reaction of drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid from its passages may occur when the maintaining drainage function of the submeningeal space of the spinal cord is manifested.
