A child diagnosed with long-standing primary hypothyroidism at age 10 and subsequent pseudotumor cerebri after initiation of thyroid therapy developed an empty sella and inappropriate thyrotropin secretion. No other evidence of thyroid hormone resistance was evident nor was there evidence of other endocrine dysfunction. This case confirms previous reports of a relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease, pseudotumor cerebri, empty sella and inappropriate anterior pituitary function.
