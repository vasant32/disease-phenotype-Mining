 OBJECTIVE: To describe published cases of cerebral mansoni schistosomiasis and three others and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral pseudotumoral schistosomiasis. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In case 1, a 20-year-old man presented with occipital headache, intense dizziness, visual alterations, nausea, decreased appetite, and asthenia. Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed an expansive cerebellar lesion in the right hemisphere with no contrast enhancement. The patient had complete resection of the lesion. Anatomicopathological examination revealed a schistosomal granuloma. In case 2, a 22-year-old man presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Cranial CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an expansive bilateral middle frontal lesion, with contrast uptake close to the cingulate gyrus and corpus callosum. The patient underwent left frontal craniotomy, and an interhemispheric approach was used to resect part of the lesion. In case 3, a 32-year-old man presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Cranial CT showed a hyperdense intense intracranial expansive lesion that presented contrast uptake in the left temporal region. The patient had complete resection of the lesion. CONCLUSIONS: A surgical approach with lesion resection or stereotaxic biopsy is warranted to determine the diagnosis definitively. Antiparasitic drugs must be administered to complete treatment.
