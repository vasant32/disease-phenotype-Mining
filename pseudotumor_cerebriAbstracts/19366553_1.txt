A 31-year-old female with a history of pseudotumor cerebri presented with headache and abdominal discomfort after placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. The VP shunt was placed after prior failure and revision of a lumbar peritoneal shunt. Computed tomography demonstrated shunt migration into the subcutaneous tissue. Laparoscopy was used to reposition the VP shunt, directing the shunt toward the pelvis. The patient presented for further evaluation one month later, at which point the shunt was shown to have migrated into the subcutaneous tissue once again. Laparoscopy was again used to reposition the shunt and affix it to the abdominal wall by using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh.
