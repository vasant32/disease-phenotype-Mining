Most cases of craniosynostosis are diagnosed during early infancy, but occasionally craniosynostosis evolves with minimal cranial involvement and goes unnoticed until late childhood. Seemingly these mild forms of craniosynostosis cause few, if any, symptoms of neurological involvement. We describe the cases of a 9-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy who presented with evident signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), together with a negligible skull deformity. We have termed these cases as occult craniosynostosis. Differential diagnosis in our patients was established against known causes of benign intracranial hypertension. Bilateral expanding craniotomies afforded total relief from the symptoms and signs of raised ICP. Neurosurgeons treating children with symptoms and signs of benign intracranial hypertension should be aware of the possibility of minimal forms of craniosynostosis evolving with marked manifestations of raised ICP.
