We report the case of a 30-year-old female patient who underwent unilateral transverse sinus stenosis stenting due to a newly diagnosed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor cerebri) with symptoms of papilledema, decreased visual acuity and headache. Resolution of the symptoms and improvement of magnetic resonance and ophthalmiologic findings could be documented.
