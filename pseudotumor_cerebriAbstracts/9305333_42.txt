To clarify the appropriate role of lumboperitoneal (LP) shunting in the surgical management of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from 30 patients who underwent this procedure. We found LP shunting to be an effective means of acutely lowering intracranial pressure. Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure improved in 82% of patients. Among 14 eyes with impaired visual acuity, 10 (71%) improved by at least two lines. Worsening of vision occurred in only one eye. Of 28 eyes with abnormal Goldmann perimetry, 18 (64%) improved and none worsened. The incidence of serious complications was low. The major drawback of LP shunting was the need for frequent revisions in a few patients. The reason for poor shunt tolerance in certain individuals is unclear. In PTC, LP shunting should be considered as the first surgical procedure for patients with severe visual loss at presentation or with intractable headache (with or without visual loss). After shunting it is important to identify patients who are shunt intolerant.
