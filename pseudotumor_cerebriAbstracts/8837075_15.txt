We report the results of a systematic study on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) with some neurological disease other than stroke in a childhood population. Patients affected by migraine, benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) or unilateral movement disorders, such as hemichorea and hemidystonia with acute-subacute onset, were screened for aPLs. None of them had clinical or serological evidence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue disease. Moderate to high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or positive Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) were demonstrated in 6 out of 17 patients with migraine, in 3 out of 4 patients with BIH and in all of the 5 patients showing unilateral movement disorders. The association between aPLs and these neurological conditions, usually regarded as cryptogenic, may suggest a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
