An obese young man presented the typical features of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), including raised intracranial pressure. Despite elevated intracranial pressure, papilledema did not develop. The syndrome resolved after medical treatment and, on examination 6 months later, the patient was normal. The absence of papilledema in this case is discussed together with data available from the literature.
