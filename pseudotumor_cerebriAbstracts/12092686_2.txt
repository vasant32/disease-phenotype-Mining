Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is an uncommon disorder in the pediatric population. It is not a benign condition. It can cause permanent vision loss. The most recently recognized risk factor for this disorder is recombinant human growth hormone (GH) therapy. Data from Genentech's National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), a postmarketing surveillance program, are analyzed to examine the relationship between GH therapy and PTC. Several areas are addressed, including plausibility, probability, clinical and laboratory presentations, management, clinical outcome, present state of knowledge, and future recommendations.
