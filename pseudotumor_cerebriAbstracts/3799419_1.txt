Pseudotumor cerebri is characterized by increased intracranial pressure and papilledema, with an essentially normal neurologic examination. The major complication is visual loss. Many patients will have spontaneous remissions. The main method of following patients with pseudotumor cerebri is repeated visual field measurements. Several modes of treatment have been described, but their value is unclear.
