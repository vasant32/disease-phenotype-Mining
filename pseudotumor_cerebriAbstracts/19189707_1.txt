Endocrine dysfunction is a rare but known cause of benign intracranial hypertensio (BIH) in adults. Here we describe a rare case of BIH in the pediatric age group associated with autoimmune hyperthyroidism. A 12-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of headaches. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral papilledema. The ocular findings were otherwise normal, with no exophthalmos. Cranial and orbital magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. Lumbar CSF opening pressure in recumbent and relaxed position was elevated (31 cm water). Thyroid hormones fT3 and fT4 were elevated while TSH was completely suppressed. As TSH receptor stimulating antibodies (TSHR-Ab) were elevated Graves' disease was diagnosed. Thyroid suppressive therapy with carbimazole was initiated and supplemented by propranolol. As hyperthyroidism improved over two weeks the headaches subsided and the papilledema slowly resolved over the next 2 months. This case illustrates that hyperthyroidism should be considered as a cause of BIH in children.
