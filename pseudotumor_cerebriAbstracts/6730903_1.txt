The prognosis of "benign" intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor cerebri) is generally favorable. In fact, the resolution of the clinical picture is related to the disappearance of the increased intracranial pressure. However, sometimes an irreversible visual loss can occur. The authors studied, over a period of time, seven subjects suffering from pseudotumor cerebri utilizing pattern visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Five patients showed normal VEPs latencies that remained such in the successive controls. Two patients displayed pathological P100 VEPs latencies. Such findings tended towards a progressive transient improvement following decompressive lumbar puncture. The authors suggest that the VEPs alterations in these patients could be due to the association of general (increased CSF pressure) and local (malformations, scleral canalis constrictions) ocular factors. In these circumstances, the pattern VEPs recordings could be coupled with traditional methods of evaluation of visual pathway damage capable of provoking an irreversible compromission of the visual function.
