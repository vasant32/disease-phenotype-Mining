Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracranial extraventricular and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. In 10 normal subjects lateral ventricular and extraventricular intracranial CSF volumes were 25.3 +/- 4.6 ml (mean +/- SD) and 97.6 +/- 6.6 ml, respectively (total 122.8 +/- 38.7). These volumes were measured in 4 patients and the results were: 11.0 ml ventricular volume, 68.7 ml total cranial CSF in the patient with benign intracranial hypertension; 606.6 ml ventricular, 174.1 ml total in the patient with hydrocephalus due to a blocked ventriculo-peritoneal (V-P) shunt; 83.4 ml ventricular, 108.5 ml total in the patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus; and 52.7 ml ventricular, 181.0 ml total in the patient with cerebral atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease. The technique gave highly reproducible results (SD less than 5.7% of mean value). It may be useful in differential diagnosis and as an objective means of monitoring therapy or progress in conditions such as cerebral atrophy, hydrocephalus, and benign intracranial hypertension.
