Five patients with serious ocular complications of benign intracranial hypertension are described. Optic nerve sheath fenestration resulted in resolution of papilloedema with, in three instances, improvement in vision. Benign intracranial hypertension may not always be benign for vision and fenestration operations may prevent or reverse visual deterioration by an effect on the optic nerve rather than by reducing intra-cranial pressure.
