We report two young women, 22 and 19 years old, who showed bilateral optic disc edema in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lumbar puncture showed increased intracranial hypertension with no abnormal findings in the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormal findings. They were diagnosed as having rare intracranial hypertension associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids produced a dramatic resolution of the increased intracranial hypertension and the disc edema.
