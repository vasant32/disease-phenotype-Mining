Investigation of vestibular function in 34 patients with benign intracranial hypertension was performed and a follow-up examination 3-20 years after the primary examination, when the symptoms of intracranial hypertension had disappeared. A primarily affected vestibular function was found in 19 patients (56%), viz. hyporeactivity in 9, preponderance in 9, and hyperreactivity in 2. Except for 2 patients, all had normal vestibular reactions at follow-up. These patients exhibited no evidence of what is called 'congestive inner ear'. An account is given also of the role of vestibular testing in connection with brain death criteria and recent experience of continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure.
