A 23 years old woman, diagnosed as having manic-depressive psychosis, in treatment with lithium carbonate for eight months, developed a benign cranial hypertension secondary to the lithium. Suppression of the lithium gave place to the normalization of the pressure of the cerebrospinal liquid which increased again with the reintroduction of the drug. This rare complication of the lithium salts, has only been described in five other cases, all women, with a relative short time of treatment, non-toxic lithium serum levels and without precipitating factors.
