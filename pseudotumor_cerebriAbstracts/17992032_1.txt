BACKGROUND: To treat with minimally invasive surgery, recurrent spinal arachnoid cysts, progressive syringomyelia, cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid fistulas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a clinical report that describes the management of recurrent spinal arachnoid cysts (2 patients), progressive syringomyelia (11 patients), postoperative spinal cerebrospinal fluid fistulas (15 patients) and postoperative cranial cerebrospinal fluid fistulas (2 patients) that were treated with spinal peritoneal shunts. The spinal arachnoid cyst and syringomyelia patients promptly resolved the signs and symptoms. The cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid fistula patients had a resolution of the fistulas. The shunts placed for spinal arachnoid cysts and syringomyelia required permanent implantation. The shunts placed for cerebrospinal fluid fistulas were temporary. All were removed, except for 2 patients whose parents did not want further operative interventions. CONCLUSION: Spinal peritoneal shunts have a variety of clinical applications and should be considered by neurological surgeons for disease processes other than communicating hydrocephalus and pseudotumor cerebri.
