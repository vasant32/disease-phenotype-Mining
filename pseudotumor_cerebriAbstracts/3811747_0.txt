Time course of changes of the CSF and the elastic properties of the cerebrospinal system were studied in 25 patients with normotensive hydrocephalus and in 26 patients suffering from benign intracranial hypertension. In 66% of cases with the normotensive hydrocephalus syndrome and in 60% of those with benign intracranial hypertension CSF resorption resistance and the elasticity gradient increased. Shunting operations proved effective in such cases.
