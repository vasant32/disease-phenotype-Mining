INTRODUCTION: The pseudotumor cerebri is characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a space occupying lesions or obstruction to the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Increased pressure but normal composition of the CSF is the diagnostic criterion. Ear infections and other infections such as sinusitis have been cited as possible, but rare, causes. CLINICAL CASE: A 12 year old girl presented with diplopia 10 days after starting treatment for sinusitis. On examination there was paresia of the VI cranial nerve to the left eye and marked bilateral papilledema. She had normal visual acuity with visual field measurements showing increased blind spot field in both eyes. Resonance studies only showed maxillary sinusitis. CSF pressure was 35 cm H2O, with 40 lymphomonocytes and normal biochemical findings. After 15 cm of CSF had been removed treatment was started with acetazolamide, dexamethasone and cefotaxime. A week later the diplopia had disappeared and the CSF pressure was 25, with no cells present. Two months later the visual fields and fundus oculi were normal. After follow-up for one year there was no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a case of pseudotumor cerebri associated with maxillary sinusitis. We do not know whether this is a chance association or whether there was a pathophysiological basis. The possibility should be considered so as to treat the cause or predisposing factor. The initial CSF pleocytosis would support the possibility of a relationship of the pseudotumor with an infectious condition (meningeal irritation or para-infectious pleocytosis meningeal irritation or para-infections pleocytosis in the context of an ENT infection), which might have precipitated the problem by interfering with the reabsorption of CSF.
