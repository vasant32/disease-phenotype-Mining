We quantified optic disc pallor in patients with pseudotumor cerebri with the Rodenstock Optic Nerve Head Analyzer before and after optic nerve sheath decompression. Mean frequency distribution of pallor peaked between the pallor values of 0.10 and 0.20 in four pseudotumor cerebri patients and between 0.50 and 0.60 in five normal subjects. The red dominant pallor reflectance in pseudotumor cerebri patients decreased significantly and shifted toward the reflectance of normal subjects gradually during the 9 weeks after successful optic nerve sheath decompression, coinciding with the ophthalmoscopic resolution of papilledema. The computerized pallor measurement with the Rodenstock Optic Nerve Head Analyzer allows an objective and quantitative assessment of papilledema in pseudotumor cerebri patients.
