Pseudotumor cerebri is idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The etiology of this syndrome has not been fully clarified. Excess cerebrospinal fluid production, scarcity of cerebrospinal fluid absorption, intracranial venous pressure elevation, increased intracranial blood volume are all thought to be responsible. The symptoms of the disease may be ordered according to prevalence as follows: headache due to increased intracranial pressure, blurred vision and diplopia. A thirteen-year-old female patient was brought in with complaints of headache, double and blurred vision. Systemic arterial hypertension (140/70 mmHg) was determined. Vesicoureteral reflux was detected as the hypertension etiology. In this article a rare pseudotumor cerebri case is presented secondary to vesicoureteral reflux which caused hypertension.
