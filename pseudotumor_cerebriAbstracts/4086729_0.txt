We report three clinical cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with favorable evolution. The treatment of this poorly-understood affection is still only symptomatic. Through the literature, we review the different physiopathological hypotheses proposed, among which the faultly resorption of C S F predominates. By analogy with the physiopathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma, we have treated these patients with beta-blocking agents.
