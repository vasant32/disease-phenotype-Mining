Ventricular concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were evaluated in 17 patients suffering from brain tumor and 4 pseudo-tumor patients. Significant differences were observed in those patients in whom the tumor leads to a marked modified CSF dynamic. No relationship were on the contrary observed between VFP and HVA or 5-HIAA levels.
