 INTRODUCTION: Bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) has been reported to be associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilloedema in headache sufferers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: To test the accuracy of short-term cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle for detection of elevated intracranial pressure in headache sufferers with BTSS, we prospectively performed lumbar puncture in order to measure lumbar CSF opening pressures and to monitor, for 1 h, the CSF pressure in 48 consecutive headache sufferers with BTSS and in 50 consecutive headache sufferers with normal appearance of transverse sinuses or stenosis of one transverse sinus. RESULTS: Of the 48 headache sufferers with BTSS, 18 (37.5%) had elevated CSF opening pressure and abnormal pressure waveforms, but short-term CSF pressure monitoring revealed abnormal pressure waves associated with elevated mean CSF pressure also in 26 (86.6%) out of 30 patients who had normal opening pressures. None of the 50 headache sufferers with normal appearance of transverse sinuses or stenosis of one transverse sinus had abnormal pressure waves and elevated CSF pressures. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, short-term CSF pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle revealed abnormal pressure waves and elevated mean CSF pressures in the majority of headache sufferers with BTSS who had normal CSF opening pressures. These findings demonstrate the accuracy of short-term CSF pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle in estimating CSF pressure; they also highlight that a single-spot opening pressure measurement has a low accuracy for recognition of increased intracranial pressure in headache sufferers with BTSS.
