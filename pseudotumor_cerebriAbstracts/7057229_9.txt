Hyperosmolar agents are a primary therapeutic modality employed in the treatment of traumatic intracranial hypertension. Profound hyperosmolarity accompanied by systemic dehydration is a potentially serious problem when these drugs are used repeatedly for control of intracranial pressure. Because glycerol, a water-soluble alcohol, is metabolized in the liver, its dehydrating capacity may be reduced in comparison to other agents. A series of 15 patients were treated with oral glycerol (0.5 to 1.0 gm/kg) with only minor changes in serum electrolytes, glucose, and urea nitrogen. Serum osmolarity rose from a baseline of 305 mOsm/liter to 355 mOsm/liter after 10 days of therapy. Glycerol was found to be effective and safe when employed in this protocol and proved to be a valuable adjunct to the standard methods available for control of intracranial hypertension.
