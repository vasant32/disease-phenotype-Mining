Selecting patients who will benefit from a permanent CSF diversion procedure in benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) or communicating hydrocephalus due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) has inherent problems. The percutaneous introduction of a lumbar subcutaneous shunt (LSS) under local anaesthesia facilitates both a prolonged CSF drainage under aseptic conditions and also elicits an adequate clinical response. We describe the technique of a lumbar subcutaneous shunt and our experience with its use in patients with BIH and NPH. Postprocedure changes in the patients' clinical status were noted. Patients with a transient clinical improvement underwent a subsequent definitive CSF diversion; those with a sustained clinical improvement or no change in symptoms had no further procedure.
