Hodgkin's disease involving contiguous areas of the skull, overlying soft tissue, and extending to the underlying epidural space, developed in a 29-year-old woman with a 3-year history of pseudotumor cerebri. The patient had been on varying doses of steroids since shortly after the development of headaches and papilledema in 1981. In 1984, following radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease, the tumor and headaches resolved. Pseudotumor cerebri antedating Hodgkin's disease has not been previously reported. The pseudotumor cerebri may have been an early manifestation of Hodgkin's disease in an unusual location.
