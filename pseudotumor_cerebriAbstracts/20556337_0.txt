The classical manifestations of Behçet disease are mouth ana genital ulcers, cutaneous lesions ana ocular involvement. The central nervous system is affected in 5 to 59% of the cases, usually in the form of meningoencephalitis or sinus venous thrombosis. We report a 17-year-old femóle presenting with a two weeks history of progressive headache, nausea and blurred vision. An initial magnetic resonance was normal. Fifteen days later she was admitted to the hospital due to progression of visual impairment. She gave a history of oral ulcers and arthralgias. A new magnetic resonance was normal. A lumbar puncture showed a cerebrospinal fluid with a protein concentration of 14 mg/dl, a glucose concentration of 64 mg/dl, 20 fresh red blood cells and a pressure of 26 cm H(2)0. The diagnosis of a pseudotumor cerebri, secondary to Behçet disease was raised and the patient was treated with colchicine and acetazolamide. The evolution was torpid and an anterior uveitis was also found. After discharge, she continued with oral and genital ulcers and was treated with infliximab. Despite treatment, headache persists.
