A 31-year-old man developed chronic secondary hypoparathyroidism after removal of goitre. Asymmetric cerebral oedema occured and a classical picture of pseudo-brain tumour with severe cerebral involvement developed which regressed merely on administration of calcium ions. The patient has remained well for over a year on dihydrotachysterol maintenance.
