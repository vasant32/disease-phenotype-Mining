Budd-Chiari syndrome developed in 3 patients with preexisting Beh√ßet's disease. Benign intracranial hypertension was the chief presenting complaint in one patient, who later suffered extensive inferior vena caval and hepatic vein thrombosis, with manifestations of Budd-Chiari syndrome. She did not respond to treatment and subsequently died of hepatic coma. In the other 2 patients, Budd-Chiari syndrome was confirmed by liver biopsy. Both patients made a good recovery and remain well at the time of this report.
