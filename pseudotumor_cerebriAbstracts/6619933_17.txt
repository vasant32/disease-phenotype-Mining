Pressure-volume indices (PVI's) were determined for a heterogeneous group of 40 patients who underwent continuous monitoring of ventricular fluid pressure (VFP). The main purpose was to investigate the relationship between VFP and PVI and to establish the significance of the measured PVI values. Determinations of PVI appear to be useful only when baseline VFP is under 20 mm Hg, maximum VFP is under 30 mm Hg, A-waves are absent, and B-waves do not occur numerously. The authors advocate starting with 1-ml bolus infusions, and then, when the resulting pressure rise exceeds 4 mm Hg, additional bolus infusions can be omitted. Results indicate that 13 ml and 10 ml are the key values for the PVI. A PVI of less than 13 ml indicates the need for either reduction of VFP and improvement of compliance or intensive monitoring of both the VFP and the volume-pressure relationship; if the PVI is below 10 ml, anti-hypertensive treatment is almost always necessary. Values of PVI's between 13 and 18 ml, although pathological, usually have no therapeutic consequences.
