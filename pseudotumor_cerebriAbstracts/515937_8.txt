A series of 28 patients presenting with benign intracranial hypertension is reported. The diagnosis was based on normal CT scanning appearances, including ventricular size, and it is stressed that no further neuroradiological investigations were required. Conservative treatment is shown to be effective in the majority of patients. It is, however, suggested that surgical intervention in the form of a shunting procedure (lumboperitoneal in our cases) might prove necessary, if vision remains in jeopardy.
