Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a syndrome characterized by intracranial hypertension in the absence of any space-occupying lesion, hydrocephalus, cerebral sinus thrombosis and biochemical or cytological abnormalities in the CSF. PC has ben associated with several factors such as systemic conditions or drugs. We report here the case of a patient who presented with headache, vomiting and blurred vision accompanied by bilateral papilledema and had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) seven years before. Treatment was started with high-dose corticosteroids with rapid resolution of the clinical symptoms and papilledema of the patient.
