PURPOSE: To report a case of benign intracranial hypertension occurring during thyreostimulin suppression hormonotherapy after thyroidectomy for papillary cancer. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 45-year-old woman underwent total thyroidectomy for a 7-mm papillary cancer. Seventeen years later, she experienced headache, dizziness, irritability, sensation of full head, and blurred vision of the right eye while being treated with a mix of L thyroxin (LT4) and liothyronin (LT3). Ophthalmological data (including the presence of papilledema), cerebroorbital magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar pressure evaluation confirmed benign intracranial hypertension. RESULTS: Substitutive hormonotherapy was decreased under specialized surveillance, permitting remission of benign intracranial hypertension symptoms and papilledema. CONCLUSIONS: Benign intracranial hypertension is usually difficult to cure, and its association with thyroid hormonotherapy is rare. In our patient, tapering LT4 and withdrawal of LT3 until a euthyroidal state was obtained resulted in successful treatment of benign intracranial hypertension.
