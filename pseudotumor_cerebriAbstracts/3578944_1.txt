In three consecutive patients suffering from life-threatening asthma in a comatose state (mean age: 37 +/- 4 yr; Glasgow coma score: 3; bilateral mydriasis), intracranial pressure was monitored with an extradural transducer set-up a mean of 2 h after the onset of the coma. The aims were to detect intracranial hypertension and to improve its therapy. Basal therapy associated: 1) mechanical ventilation; 2) theophylline 1.5 g X 24 h-1, salbutamol 30 mg X 24 h-1, hydrocortisone 2 g X 24 h-1, pancuronium 0.5 mg X kg-1 X 24 h-1; 3) pentobarbitone 35 mg X kg-1 X 24 h-1, normal hydration, normothermia and 30 degrees head-up tilt. If the intracranial pressure rose above 15 mmHg, an i.v. bolus of pentobarbitone (5 mg X kg-1) was given if the barbiturate blood level was equal or below 100 micrograms X l-1. In case of failure, a dose of mannitol (20 mg) completed the therapy if blood therapy was equal or below 320 mosm X l-1. All patients developed intracranial hypertension (21, 53 and 23 mmHg, respectively). The intracranial hypertension followed the bronchospasm and disappeared with it. Hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and high peak airway pressures could explain the intracranial hypertension. All patients recovered without sequelae. This data should make us use with great care all treatments likely to increase the intracranial pressure during life-threatening asthma.
