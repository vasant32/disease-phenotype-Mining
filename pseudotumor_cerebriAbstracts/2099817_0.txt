The incidence of obesity and excess weight were analyzed in a series of 100 cases of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) and compared with a control group. The results of hypocaloric diet and lumbar puncture were compared to those obtained with other treatments. Relapses of the disease were analyzed in obese patients who maintained a normal weight after clinical recovery and compared with those who get fat again. A similar analysis was carried out in pregnant women. The frequency of sequelae in obese patients was also determined. A high incidence of obesity was observed only in women aged 20 to 40 years who presented BIH. Hypocaloric diet and lumbar puncture constituted the treatment which exerted a more marked shortening of the clinical course. Relapses of BIH were more frequent in obese patients who did not normalize the body weight and in new pregnant women. Data indicate the relevance of obesity as etiopathogenetic factor in a group of patients with BIH.
