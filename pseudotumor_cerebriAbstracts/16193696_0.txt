Retrobulbar neuritis is often very complicated clinical entity. The most common cause of retrobulbar neuritis is demyelinating disease of CNS. This report is to express some other uncommon causes of it. Three children, age 8 to 12 with sudden and severe visual loss are presented. The diagnosis of retrobulbar neuritis is made by complete ophtalmological examination in consultation with neuropediatrics and neuroradiologist. Different ethiological causes of retrobulbar neuritis are found: pranasal sinusitis, functional visual loss and pseudotumor cerebri. In first two children complete therapeutically effort was as expected, and by child with pseudotumor cerebri there was no improvement of visual acuity, even after 6 months. In this presentation the authors want to emphasise some uncommon causes of retrobulbar neuritis.
