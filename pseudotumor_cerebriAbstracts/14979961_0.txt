Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon otological symptom, which often presents a diagnostic and management dilemma to the otolaryngologist. This symptom always deserves a thorough evaluation to avoid disastrous consequences from potentially life-threatening associated pathology. In most of the patients a treatable underlying aetiology can be identified. Frequent causes mentioned in the literature responsible for pulsatile tinnitus are benign intracranial hypertension syndrome, temporal bone paragangliomas and arteriovenous fistulae. Pulsatile tinnitus as a consequence of sigmoid sinus compression by a cholesteatoma has not been reported previously in the literature. Here a case of residual cholesteatoma with pulsatile tinnitus is presented, nine years after the first surgery.
