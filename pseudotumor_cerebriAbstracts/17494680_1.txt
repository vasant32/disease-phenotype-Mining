Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by prolonged eosinophilia without an identifiable cause, ultimately resulting in organ dysfunction. Three major types of neurologic involvement have been well defined in HES; however, to our knowledge, inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) in association with HES has not been reported. We present a case of IPT of the skull base in a patient with HES that suggests that HES may result in an exaggerated immunologic or inflammatory response leading to the formation of IPT.
