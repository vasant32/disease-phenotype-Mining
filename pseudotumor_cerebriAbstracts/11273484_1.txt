Behçet's disease (BD) is a multifocal disorder with an immunogenetic basis, which persists over many years. Initial descriptions mentioned oral and genital ulcers with uveitis. Later a number of other manifestations were added, like skin, joint and neurological. The involvement of nervous system (Neuro-Behçet's) is reportedly uncommon. We hereby report four cases of Neuro-Behçet's, i.e.; two cases of strokes involving multiple areas of the central nervous system and two cases had features of benign intracranial hypertension. All cases had mucocutaneous lesions or other system involvement. Cases satisfied the international study group criteria for diagnosis of BD. All cases were pathergy test positive. In comparison with the literature from Turkey and Greece, which reports a high pathergy positivity, reports from India have shown only few cases to be positive. The prognosis of Neuro-Behçet used to be poor but has recently been improved with reduced mortality, although whether this can be attributed to treatment with steroids and/or cytotoxic agents remains uncertain.
