Several secondary causes are implicated in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Rofecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, now being increasingly used in place of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We report a case of intracranial hypertension in a 69-year-old man 3 weeks after the commencement of rofecoxib therapy with reversal of clinical findings on drug withdrawal.
