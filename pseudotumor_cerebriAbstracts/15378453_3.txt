INTRODUCTION: Different patterns of headache have been reported in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate patients in a Columbian hospital who satisfied Friedman and Jacobson criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Two groups of patients, with throbbing headaches (TH) and heaviness/oppressive headaches (HOH), were correlated with International Headache Society classification criteria. RESULTS: We found 16 patients, 14 of whom were females (87.5%), with a mean age of 27 years. Patients had a history of two months or more (43.7%), 1-2 months (25%) and 2 weeks (18.7%). Six patients were found to be suffering from TH and nine had HOH. In the TH group, headaches were hemicranial (50%), frontal (33.3%), moderate (33.3%), severe (66.6%), got worse with activity (100%), with sickness/vomiting (83.3%), and photophobia (33.3%). All of them had clinical parameters similar to those of migraine. In the HOH group headaches were global (33.3%), hemicranial (22.2%), frontal and occipital (22.2%), moderate (66.6%), severe (33.3%), and with sickness/vomiting (55.5%). 66.6% of them had clinical parameters similar to those of de novo chronic daily headache (NCDH). On carrying out a physical examination in all the patients, paresis of the abducent nerve was found in 31.2% and papilloedema in 93.7%. The average opening pressure was 27 cmH2O. Computerised axial tomography scanning revealed unspecific anomalies in 18.7% and they were also observed with magnetic resonance imaging in 31.2%. Associated pathologies were found in six patients (37%). Pharmacological treatment was effective in 93.8%. There were no relapses or sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a malady affecting young people, mainly females, with subacute headaches and symptoms similar to those of migraine and NCDH. A neurological abnormality suggestive of intracranial hypertension was found in 31.2-93.7% of patients.
