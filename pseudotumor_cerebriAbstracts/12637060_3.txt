The clinical presentation of dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) is dependent on their location and the nature of their venous drainage. The latter plays a critical part in determining whether or not the fistula gives rise to intracranial hypertension, which is present in only a minority of cases. We present a case of the pseudotumour cerebri syndrome in an elderly man with bilateral intracranial DAVF supplied by the occipital arteries. Cerebral angiography was required for definitive diagnosis, and to characterise the abnormal venous drainage. The pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension in DAVF is discussed.
