PURPOSE: To report a case of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) following treatment with human recombinant growth hormone (GH). METHODS: A 42-year-old man who developed pseudotumor cerebri 7 years after starting human recombinant GH treatment is presented. RESULTS: The patient's medical history was significant for hypophyseal dwarfism with a serious deficit of GH, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. In 1996 he started taking GH, testosterone, and L-thyroxine. Fundus examination showed disc edema in the left eye. GH was discontinued, and acetazolamide therapy was initiated. At the 3-month follow-up the acuity without correction was patch and the unilateral papilledema had resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudotumor cerebri or idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an uncommon and complex disorder. The diagnosis is possible when important criteria symptoms and signs are met. Several conditions and risk factors are associated with PTC. The most recently recognized risk factor is GH therapy.
