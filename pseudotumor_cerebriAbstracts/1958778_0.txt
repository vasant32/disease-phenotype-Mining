The recurrence of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) in 100 patients was analysed after a long-term follow-up. A recurrence appeared in 20% of the cases in this series. This being more frequent, with statistical significance, in females aged between 20-40 years. Obesity was the more frequent etiopathogenic factor involved in the onset of relapses. Other factors were pregnancy, steroid therapy, levothyroxine and obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid derivation system. Relapses did not produce loss of sight. We insist on the elimination of developing factors in order to prevent the recurrence.
