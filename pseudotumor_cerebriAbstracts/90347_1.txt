Three patients with headache and increased intracranial pressure had elevated blood, serum, and adipose levels of the organochlorine insecticide chlordecone (Kepone). These patients were among 23 employees who suffered from chronic chlordecone intoxication resulting from industrial exposure. In our three patients, investigations eliminated an intracranial mass or other known causes of psuedotumor cerebri. In all three patients, the capacity for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was assessed by graded infusions into the subarachnoid space, and was found to be impaired even when papilledema was minimal.
