Pseudotumor cerebri occurs quite rarely in the pediatric population and its clinical features differ from adults in many ways. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema should obviously be treated promptly to avoid permanent visual damage, but various more or less invasive options have been proposed over the years, from bariatric surgery for obesity to optic nerve sheath fenestration. We report a prospective study on a group of 15 children, aged 3-16 years, with clinical and instrumental diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. All the patients were treated simply by external lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage with a mean volume of 10 ml/h for 3-5 days, with hypocaloric diet and with appropriate dosages of acetazolamide. All had immediate relief of headache, a considerable reduction in papilledema and marked improvement of both visual loss and cranial nerve palsies within 2 months. None of the patients relapsed during the follow-up period, ranging from 12-48 months.
