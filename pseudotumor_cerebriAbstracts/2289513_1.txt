The case of a 22-year-old patient is described, who developed a clinical picture of pseudotumor cerebri in the course of typhoid fever, an association not previously described. The patient progressed favorably after treatment with amoxicillin. The etiopathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri is briefly discussed, as is the need to study the possible existence of this disorder in cases of typhoid fever patients with headaches and/or visual deficits which are not readily explained.
