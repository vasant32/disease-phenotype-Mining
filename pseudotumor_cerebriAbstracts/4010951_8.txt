In 28 patients with benign intracranial hypertension, CT showed an abnormality in 36% of cases. The abnormalities included small ventricles, empty sella, enlarged cisterna magna, and dilated optic nerve sheaths. The only reversible changes were small-sized ventricles and basal cisterns, which returned to normal size after CSF pressure returned to normal. One patient with visual loss and one with normal acuity had enlarged optic nerve sheaths.
