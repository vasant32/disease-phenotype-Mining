Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without hydrocephaly or intracranial process. Its mechanism is poorly understood. Most cases of benign intracranial hypertension are presumed to be idiopathic but some of them may be related to some treatment. We report a 26-year-old female with benign intracranial hypertension due to tetracycline, revealed by headaches and gradual visual loss. Standard investigations were unremarkable and favourable outcome after therapeutic lumbar puncture confirmed the diagnosis.
