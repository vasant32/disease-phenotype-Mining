Two patients in whom the signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension resolved after surgical correction of hydrocephalus are described. In both instances skull roentgenograms showed an abnormal sella turcica, and an arteriogram and sir study were necessary to prevent misdiagnosis as "pseudotumor cerebri." Evidence of clinical endocrine dysfunction is an early sign of pituitary tumors, but hypopituitarism may also occur in patients with extrasellar processes, including hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension.
