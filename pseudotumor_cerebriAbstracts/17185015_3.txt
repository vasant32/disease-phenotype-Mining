The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) relies heavily on the appearance of the optic disc. We report eighteen children referred to us over a 3 year period with disc swelling and suspected IIH. Following a tertiary ophthalmological review, papilloedema was excluded in ten with buried drusen, disc crowding, pseudopapilloedema, or misinterpretation of normal appearances. In these ten children, five had a mean opening pressure on lumbar puncture of 27.2 cm H2O, range 19-32, which was significantly lower than those with IIH (37.5 cm H2O, range 29-47; p<0.01). We conclude that diagnosis of IIH is difficult, and that more precisely defined criteria for assessment and diagnosis are needed.
