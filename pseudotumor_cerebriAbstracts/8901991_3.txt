High frequency ventilation techniques are not applied as routine measures but are still regarded as lastditch efforts in treating patients with severe ARDS or with extensive bronchoplural fistula when conventional mechanical ventilation is not capable in providing sufficient gas exchange. High frequency ventilation techniques can be used in patients with septicemia or recent cerebral bleeding, which is a contraindication for ECMO, or in patients with increased ICP. We believe that high frequency ventilation techniques provide an important therapeutic tool in the treatment of pulmonary insufficiency since the hardware requirement is minimal and, after a brief explanation, the application is easy.
