 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ocular manifestation of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). METHODS: It was a retrospective case series study. Clinical data of BIH patients were investigated retrospectively, including symptom, fundus findings, visual acuity and visual field. RESULTS: It was a retrospective case series study. The majority of 67 patients were female (46 cases, 87%), of which 71.7% were over-weight. While ocular symptoms were reported in 94.0% (63 cases) of cases in whole disease course, 28 cases (41.8%) primarily presented with ocular symptoms, including transient bilateral loss of vision, visual deterioration and diplopia. Papilledema was found in 65 cases (97.0%), of which 54 cases (80.6%) were bilateral. Some patients showed unilateral papilledema (11 cases, 16.4%)and optic atrophy. Abnormal visual acuity was found in 95 eyes (70.9%), of which 35 eyes (26.4%) were below 20/200. Visual field abnormality was found in 89.8% of 49 tested cases. The most common visual field lesion was the enlargement of the blind spot (82 eyes, 83.7%), followed by general constriction in 24 eyes (24.5%), nasal step in 17 eyes (25.4%), central scotoma in 9 eyes (9.2%), Bjerrum scotoma in 22 eyes (22.4%) and arcuate scotoma in 14 eyes (14.3%). CONCLUSION: BIH is not really "benign", especially from the viewpoint of optic nerve function.
