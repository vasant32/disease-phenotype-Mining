Excessively small ventricle (ESV) was demonstrated in 75 (8.3%) of 9,000 patients over 15 years of age examined by cranial computed tomography (CT). The patients had no other CT abnormality except for ESV. Detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records of these 75 patients revealed four major groups of patients: 1) those with seizures (24%); 2) those with headaches (24%); 3) those with acute non-penetrating head trauma (21.5%); and 4) those with benign increased intracranial pressure (8%). The remaining patients (22.5%) had a variety of cerebral derangements.
