OBJECTIVE: To determinate if fibronectin in CSF can be a useful parameter in the diagnosis of some neurologic illnesses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied 30 patients, subdivided in four groups, depending on the type of neurologic illness. We have chosen as control a 10-patient group, which came to the Emergency Service and were diagnosed as a suspicious of neurologic illness, but after this it was discarded. In the whole group we practiced a lumbar puncture, with cytology, systematic, biochemistry, cultures, immunoglobulins determination and fibronectin quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: We want to emphasize the increase in fibronectin levels in CSF in both the patients with bacterial meningitis and the multiple sclerosis groups, when it's compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: For this, the determination of fibronectin levels in CSF might be a useful parameter in the diagnosis of some neurologic illnesses.
