The authors describe a case of a diffuse primary leptomeningeal oligodendroglioma in a 17-year-old girl who presented with raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. She underwent imaging studies and a left frontotemporal craniotomy that revealed a cystic oligodendroglioma in the suprasellar cistern and spread of neoplastic cells to the spinal leptomeninges. The tumor showed little response to maximum radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the patient died from complications of high-dose chemotherapy 2 years after diagnosis. Postmortem examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed diffuse meningeal infiltration by neoplastic cells and no evidence of an intraparenchymal origin. Glial heterotopias were noted at several sites along the brain base, adding circumstantial support to the theory that leptomeningeal gliomas are derived from ectopic glial tissue in the subarachnoid space.
