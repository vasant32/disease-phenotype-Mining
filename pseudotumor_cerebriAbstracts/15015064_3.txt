An 11-year-old boy with recurrent nephritis due to tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with uveitis (TINU syndrome) was treated with cyclosporin A (CSA) to induce sustained remission. CSA was introduced as a steroid-sparing drug because of extreme obesity (body mass index 32 kg/m(2)). Although the boy did not complain of any clinical symptoms, eye inspection after 7 months revealed bilateral disk edema with retinal bleeding and the patient developed cerebrospinal hypertension. Pseudotumor cerebri was diagnosed by measuring the intracranial pressure (31 cm H(2)O) and normal computer tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cessation of CSA therapy and treatment with mycophenolate mofetil led to resolution within 12 weeks.
