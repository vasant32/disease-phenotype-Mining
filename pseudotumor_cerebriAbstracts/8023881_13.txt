We treated four patients who had acute, severe visual loss associated with pseudotumor cerebri with intravenous methylprednisolone (250 mg four times per day) for five days followed by an oral taper, in combination with acetazolamide and ranitidine. In addition to high-grade disk edema, one patient had serous detachment of both maculas and lipid deposition, one had a unilateral macular star, and one had a monocular branch retinal artery occlusion. These three patients experienced rapid and lasting improvement in visual acuity, visual field, papilledema, and symptoms. Vision of the fourth patient did not improve, requiring optic nerve sheath fenestration for chronic papilledema. Transient acne developed in one patient. This regimen is a safe, effective treatment of acute, severe visual loss associated with florid papilledema of pseudotumor cerebri. Lack of immediate improvement is an indication for optic nerve sheath decompression.
