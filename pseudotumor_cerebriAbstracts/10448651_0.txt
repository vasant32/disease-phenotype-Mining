Papilledema from benign intracranial hypertension can cause severe loss of visual acuity and visual field, with an optic neuropathy. We report a study of 5 patients with benign intracranial hypertension, and severe visual loss (visual field loss and visual acuity reduced to 1/10 or less) not improved by medical therapy (acetazolamide). We performed unilateral orbital decompression of the optic nerve sheath. No major operative complication was noted. Follow-up ranged from 11 months to 23 months, with an average of sixteen months. Visual function improvement was noted within 3 months after operation in 4 patients (for 2 eyes on the surgical side improvement of 2/10 and 5/10, for 3 eyes on the opposite surgical side average improvement of 4.6/10). The other patient showed improvement, but no significant. Optic nerve sheath decompression in benign intracranial hypertension seems to be a safe procedure and a therapeutic option in the management of raised intracranial pressure complicated by optic neuropathy with severe visual loss.
