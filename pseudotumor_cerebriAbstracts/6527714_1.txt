This paper is based on a predominant type of craniosynostosis seen in Maghreb, the oxycephaly (82,5% of all craniosynostosis in our series). The authors describe a surgical technic which is based on King's free flaps method, used by Acquaviva and Berrada, and Powiertowski's total craniectomy. With this technic, they perform craniectomy of the vertical part of the frontal bone, extended to temporal bone and 2-3 cm behind lambdoid suture. Two small flaps of parietal and temporal bones are left in place sparing temporal muscle insertion. The authors give results of 200 cases treated in the Neuro-Surgical Hospital Ali Ait-Idir Algiers, which consist in encephalic reexpansion and physiological redistribution of the cranial diameters. The authors emphasize a stabilisation is not a recovery from the functional signs, with normalisation in 3/4 of cases of the E.E.G. patterns. The visual acuity is stabilised. In conclusion, the authors estimate this technic has a place among the others procedures in the management of the craniosynostosis.
