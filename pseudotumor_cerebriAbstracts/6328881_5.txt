Results of treatment of low grade astrocytoma by surgery and postoperative irradiation in 35 children under 15 were retrospectively analysed. The actuarial overall 5 and 10 year survival was 94 and 82 per cent, the actuarial relapse-free survival 87 and 70 per cent, respectively. The male patients fared better, although not significantly, than the females. No significant difference in relapse rate was found between cystic and solid tumors. The cystic processes had a more indolent course, but a fatal outcome was noted in one case (after 21 years). No relapse occurred in totally removed tumors (10 cases), which throws doubt on the need for postoperative irradiation in this subgroup. In the subtotally resected processes (24 cases) radiation therapy seemed to be beneficial, as in 3 of 4 local recurrences geographic misses of tumour remains probably existed. No dose response relationship was apparent. The performance status was severely impaired in 11 per cent (3/27 patients). Growth retardation was observed in 2 patients.
