A 7-year-old boy presented with a 4-week history of daily headache. His parents reported that he was unable to attend school the week prior to presentation. Intermittent nausea without vomiting was reported, but no blurred vision, photophobia, or diplopia were described. There was no history of trauma or recent systemic illness. The physical examination showed mild neck discomfort, no papilledema, and normal cranial nerve, motor and sensory functioning. Both a CT scan of the sinuses and an MRI of the brain were normal. Although the opening pressure was elevated, the cerebrospinal fluid was also normal. In previous accounts of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children, concomitant papilledema, visual symptoms and/or palsy of the sixth cranial nerve are described. This case demonstrates that idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a young child can present as a daily headache without any visual symptoms or signs.
