The course of acute leukaemias, particularly of the lymphoblastic type, is very frequently complicated by the development of neuromeningeal localisations of the disease. They may, more rarely, be presenting initial lesions, their origin being confirmed clinically and/or biologically, but it is exceptional that they remain a strictly isolated expression of the affection. A case is reported of a 16-year-old adolescent with leukaemic meningitis, in whom haematological tests (blood counts, bone marrow smear, iliac medullary biopsy, lymph node biopsy) gave negative results over a period of at least two months. Based on the findings in this case, the significance of early neuromeningeal localisations of acute leukaemias is discussed.
