BACKGROUND: In pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) results in papilledema and, rarely, choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Pseudotumor cerebri-induced CNV often regresses following medical or surgical ICP reduction, but additional treatments, such as photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, peri-ocular steroid injections and/or subretinal surgery, may be necessary. Anti-angiogenic intravitreal injections have been shown to cause regression of both CNV and optic nerve edema. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient with PTC and CNV whose CNV regressed and vision normalized after a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA).
