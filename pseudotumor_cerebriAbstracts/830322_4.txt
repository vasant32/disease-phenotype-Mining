A total of 29 alert patients with papilledema and no localizing neurological signs were evaluated by computed tomography. Lesions were demonstrated in 8 who exhibited ventricular enlargement or abnormal tissue density; 19 had normal ventricles which suggested pseudotumor cerebri and only 6 of these patients underwent subsequent pneumoencephalography. In alert patients with papilledema alone, CT can demonstrate ventricular abnormalities and abnormal densities, and assist in the diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension without pneumoencephalography or angiography.
