Pseudotumour cerebri is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of intracranial pathology. The possible association between this condition and infections has already been mention in a few case series. This paper describes a 6-y-old girl with a classical picture of pseudotumour cerebri: which developed 1 week following varicella. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description suggesting this association. Additional reports are required to support the possible relationship between the two conditions.
