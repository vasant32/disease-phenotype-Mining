A case of delayed signs of intracranial hypertension after open depressed cranial fracture occluding the superior sagittal sinus is reported. Elevating depressed fractures overlying a cranial venous sinus is hazardous. Conservative management of the intracranial hypertension, including repeated lumbar punctures, led to an unimpaired outcome. The options of management of delayed problems caused by traumatic venous occlusion are discussed.
