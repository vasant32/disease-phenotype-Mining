Hydrocephalus without ventriculomegaly and pseudotumor cerebri may present special problems in its treatment. Lumboperitoneal shunting, although frequently effective, is not successful in all cases. A lumbar subarachnoid to venous shunt is described as an alternative to lumboperitoneal shunting. A case illustrating its use is reported.
