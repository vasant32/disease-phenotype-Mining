Acute intracranial hypertension requires aggressive treatment with physiologic and pharmacologic measures guided by intracranial pressure monitoring devices. Therapy involves the use of diuretics, corticosteroids, and barbiturates in combination with hyperventilation, ventricular drainage, and general supportive measures. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of increased intracranial pressure and the pharmacologic agents used in its management.
