Otologic manifestations of pseudotumor cerebri heightened awareness of pseudotumor cerebri and its varied subtle presentations will allow for a more expedient diagnosis by the otolaryngologist. Pseudotumor cerebri is defined as increased intracranial pressure and papilledema without a mass lesion or obstruction of the ventricular system. Presenting symptoms most commonly are headache and visual dysfunction. However, patients may present with associated symptoms of tinnitus, dizziness and hearing loss. These patients may be seen first by the otolaryngologist. Fourteen patients with a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri are reviewed. Nine of the 14 patients had neurotologic symptoms during the course of their evaluation. Pseudotumor cerebri is a diagnostic challenge. Keys to diagnosis are a high index of suspicion, careful history and funduscopic examination in patients with unexplained neuro-otologic symptoms.
