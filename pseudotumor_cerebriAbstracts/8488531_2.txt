BACKGROUND: Massive bilateral infarcts due to deep venous system thrombosis are extremely rare and poorly documented. We present a case with computed tomographic evidence of both thrombosis and infarction of the whole deep venous system. CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 30-year-old woman who had taken oral contraceptives for 3 years complained of recurrent headaches and transient visual obscuration. Three months later, she suddenly became comatose and was found to have papilledema. She rapidly worsened, became decerebrate, and died within 48 hours. Noncontrast computed tomographic scan showed the spontaneous hyperdensity of the thrombosed deep veins and a massive bilateral centrobasilar hypodensity suggestive of a deep venous system infarction. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that cerebral venous thrombosis can masquerade during 3 months as benign intracranial hypertension and then make a dramatic extension to the deep cerebral veins. It illustrates extensive thrombosis of the deep venous system as a possible cause of rapid coma and decerebration and stresses the importance of computed tomographic scan to show both the thrombosed veins and the venous infarct, which allows delineation of the deep venous system territory.
