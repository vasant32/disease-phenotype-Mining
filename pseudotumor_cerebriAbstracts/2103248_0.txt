2 exceptional cases of neurobrucellosis, which manifested as intracranial hypertension and subdural hemorrhage, are presented. A revision of the subject was carried out. We consider that the association of two antibiotics (rifampin, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) are valid and should be administered until the symptoms disappear and the CSF becomes normal. We suggest that all nervous system symptoms in our area, which are not clear, should be studied for brucella because sometimes these are the only features of neurobrucellosis.
