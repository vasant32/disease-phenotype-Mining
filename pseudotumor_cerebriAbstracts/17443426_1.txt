OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiology of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as seen in patients attending our ophthalmology department. METHODS: The medical records of patients diagnosed with PTC in our hospital during a ten-year period (1994 to 2004) were obtained, with only those patients with PTC diagnosed in our ophthalmology department being considered. The following data were reviewed: sex, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and the results of CT and MRI. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were diagnosed with PTC during this time period. Twenty-six were females (89.6%) and 3 were males (10.4%). The calculated incidence of PTC in our population was 3.2 per 100.000 persons and 5.1 per 100.000 persons in the general population that attend our hospital. CONCLUSION: The incidence of PTC was higher than that previously reported.
