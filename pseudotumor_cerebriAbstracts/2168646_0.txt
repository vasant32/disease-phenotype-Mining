The findings of clinical examination, laboratory tests, and diagnostic methods of examination were compared with the results of prolonged measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) in 64 patients with a severe craniocerebral trauma. Seventy-four clinical and laboratory signs and the results of echoencephalography [correction of echoelectrography] and computed tomography were analysed and those found to be most informative on the basis of the "x-quadrant" criterion were distinguished. The distinguished signs accompanying ICP were rated in marks. A scale of hypertension was compiled according to the sum of the marks of these signs. This scale makes it possible to select patients for prolonged continuous ICP control.
