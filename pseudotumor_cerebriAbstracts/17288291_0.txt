The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is based on the triad of: (1) papilledema, (2) elevated intracranial pressure with a normal cerebrospinal constituency and (3) normal central nervous system imaging studies. It is an uncommon complication of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy in children treated for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Its occurrence is rare among adult patients with APL and treated with ATRA . We report a case of an adult with APL who developed PC during induction therapy with ATRA-PC was managed with repeated lumbar punctures and corticotherapy.
