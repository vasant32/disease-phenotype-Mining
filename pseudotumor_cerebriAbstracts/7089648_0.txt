When comparing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prolactin concentration in women having pseudotumor cerebri with men and women having other neurologic disorders, we found a significant increase in CSF prolactin in those subjects with pseudotumor cerebri. This finding suggest an active role for prolactin in CSF production and an etiologic role for prolactin in pseudotumor cerebri.
