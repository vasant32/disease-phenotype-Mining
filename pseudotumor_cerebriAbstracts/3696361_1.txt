The authors describes a 17 years old woman with a small occipital intradiploic epidermoid cyst simulating a benign intracranial hypertension on an initial CT scanner. Digital angiography showed torcular compression by the tumor. Intracranial pressure and sagittal sinus pressure were analysed and implicated the epidermoid cyst as the cause of the intracranial hypertension.
