PURPOSE: To ascertain the annual incidence rate and the clinical features, other than visual outcome, of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in Parma, northern Italy. METHODS: Neurologic care of people living in the Parma area is entirely provided by one private and two public hospitals. Medical records related to IIH were retrospectively reviewed for all Parma residents from 1990 through 1999. RESULTS: Ten patients (8 women and 2 men) were identified as having IIH according to modified Dandy criteria. Their age ranged from 16 to 53 years with a mean of 36 years at diagnosis. The annual age-adjusted rate per 100,000 is 0.28 for the total population. For women in reproductive age, the annual incidence rate is 0.65/100,000. For overweight women in reproductive age, the annual incidence rate is 2.7/100,000. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate found in this study is lower than the incidence reported in previous US and Libyan studies. A significant difference in overweight distribution is observed comparing percentage of body weight between US and Parma populations. As overweight and obesity are important factors contributing to IIH development, it is possible that their low percentage in the Parma population may, at least partially, explain the low IIH incidence observed.
