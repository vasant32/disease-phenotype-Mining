A woman, who presented with clinical and radiological signs of a right temporal mass suggestive of a brain tumour, was found to have granulomatous angiitis associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy; the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. She is still well 13 years after excision of the lesion. The association of granulomatous angiitis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy constitutes a peculiar variety of central nervous system micro-angiopathy. Only a few similar cases have been described.
