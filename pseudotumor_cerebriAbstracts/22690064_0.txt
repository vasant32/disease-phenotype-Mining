We describe a case of pseudotumor cerebri in a young man developing 4 years post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 29-year-old man was admitted after sustaining a fall with headache, and no clinical deficits were noted on examination. CT brain demonstrated an extradural hematoma. This was successfully evacuated after his symptomatic worsening. Following this, he developed bone flap infection and had the infected bone flap removed. He developed chronic mild-to-moderate headache following these procedures, which failed to respond to medical treatment. Pseudotumor cerebri was diagnosed. A lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt, and bitemporal craniectomy were performed as a part of management at different stages. Post-TBI patients may present with chronic headache and in such circumstances, a possibility of pseudotumor cerebri must be considered. Investigations should include neuroimaging in the form of MRI/MRV and fundoscopy to look for papilledema. Management in the form of CSF flow diversion techniques (VP and LP shunt) with medical management results in good clinical outcomes.
