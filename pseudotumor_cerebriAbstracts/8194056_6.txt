A mathematical model of the regulation of ventricular volume, which emphasizes the importance of the intrinsic properties (turgor) of the brain for the understanding of hydrocephalus, has been developed. How the model was generated is described. The use of the model for understanding the various forms of hydrocephalus is discussed. Finally, the usefulness of the model in solving difficult clinical problems, such as diffuse pediatric head injury and progressive ventriculomegaly with low intracranial pressure, is described.
