We describe a case of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) whose onset coincided with treatment of danazol for menorrhagia. No other causative factors were identified. Headache and visual symptoms occurring in patients treated with danazol therefore require careful assessment, so that visual failure from advanced BIH can be avoided by appropriate treatment.
