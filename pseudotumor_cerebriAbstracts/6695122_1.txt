Twelve cases of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) are reported, there being a higher proportion of women patients and a greater frequency of those in the 3rd decade of life. Symptoms were principally headache (11 patients) and/or transient or permanent visual disorders (10 patients). Bilateral papillary edema was often associated with diminished visual acuity (5 cases) and/or amputation of the visual field (5 cases). Cerebral venous occlusion was detected in 3 patients and an infective focus in 7 cases. Three patients were receiving some treatment but none of the women was taking oral contraceptives. Two were pregnant. The CSF was abnormal in 5 of the 7 patients (mixed cell reaction and red blood cells: 1 case; pleiocytosis: 3 cases; raised protein levels: 1 case), and CT scans were normal except for reduced ventricular system size in 9 patients. Follow-up for a mean of 1 year showed total disappearance of symptoms and signs in 4 cases. Papillary edema had not totally regressed at the last ophthalmological examinations performed on 5 patients, and visual sequelae (visual acuity and/or visual field anomalies) were present in 5 cases. Two patients relapsed. The conventional acceptance of the benign nature of BIH must be tempered by the possible onset of possible serious visual disorders. Two factors appear to be determinant: the presence of severe visual disorders initially and/or the existence of arterial hypertension. Various physiopathogenic hypotheses have been evoked to explain BIH. The essential mechanism appears to be an anomaly of absorption of CSF, either from increased pressure in the dural venous sinuses or lesions of the arachnoid villi, but the role of cerebral edema and/or increased cerebral blood volume cannot be excluded. Incomplete understanding of physiopathogenic mechanisms account for the numerous treatments proposed and for some confusion in their indications.
