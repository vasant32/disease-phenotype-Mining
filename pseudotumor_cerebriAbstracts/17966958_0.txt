Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a seldom seen entity characterized by signs and symptoms associated with the intracranial hypertension (IH) without obvious causes. Some medical disorders and exogenous agents have been implicated in the development of PTC. Danazol is a popular gonadotropin inhibitor used for the treatment of endometriosis, breast disease and hereditary angioedema. While PTC has been occasionally reported in patients receiving danazol treatment, it is barely mentioned in those who discontinued danazol therapy abruptly. Here we report a case of IH developed soon after the withdrawal of danazol.
