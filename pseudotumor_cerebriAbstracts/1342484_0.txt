Cyclosporine is a specially useful immunosuppressor agent in children subjected to renal transplantation, minimizing the deleterious effect of steroids on growth and the development of Cushing syndrome. However, side effects which require close supervision are well known, including liver, kidney and central nervous system toxicity. Seizures, cerebellar ataxia, aphasia, paresthesia and behavioral disorders are characteristic of the latter. Hypertension and hypomagnesemia have been identified as risk factors. In contrast to nephrotoxicity, CNS toxicity is not related to plasma levels of cyclosporine. In this paper 2 patients, 10 and 11 year old, manifesting cyclosporine neurotoxicity after renal transplant, are reported.
