Clinico-neurologic and electrophysiologic examination of 338 patients in the long-term period of brain trauma has permitted the identification of 5 principal syndromes: cerebro-focal, hypothalamus--brain stem, hypertensive-hydrocephalic, asthenoneurotic and epileptic. The characteristics of the clinical course of the syndromes with regard to the nature, localization and duration of isolated and combined craniocerebral injury are outlined.
