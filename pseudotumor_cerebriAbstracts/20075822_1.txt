AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of lumboperitoneal flow-regulated shunt for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). METHODS: This was a retrospective study carried out on four patients with IIH, treated from January to December 2007 with lumboperitoneal flow-regulated shunt (OSV II Smart Valve Systems; Integra NeuroSciences). The mean follow-up period was 13 months. RESULTS: The treatment was successful in alleviating symptoms in all cases and no patient required revisions. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion the placement of flow-regulated valves is a satisfactory treatment for those IIH patients who require surgical therapy.
