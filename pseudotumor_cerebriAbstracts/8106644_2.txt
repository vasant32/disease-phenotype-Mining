Pseudotumor cerebri as a presenting manifestation of neurosarcoidosis is rare. This case reported herein had pseudotumor cerebri secondary to dural sinus thrombosis as a presenting feature of neurosarcoidosis without known systemic sarcoidosis. Proper systemic steroid therapy resulted in ocular and systemic recovery. Neurosarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri in patients with unusual neurological findings.
