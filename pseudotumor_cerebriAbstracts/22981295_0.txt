The pathogenesis and treatment paradigm for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are controversial. Transverse sinus stenosis is seen in the majority of patients with IIH and appears to play a role in the disease process. The debate continues as to whether transverse sinus stenosis is a primary or secondary process relative to raised intracranial pressure. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. Beside the classical surgical treatments, venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH. However, additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy. The goal of this article is to review the current literature on dural venous sinus stenting.
