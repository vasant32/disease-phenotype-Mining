Blood flow velocity of 24 patients in state of the brain death were examined by transcranial Doppler sonography. Authors expound the characteristic velocity-pulse graphs recorded in progressively increasing intracranial pressure and their chronology as well. The different forms of the oscillating flow and their successive development are described. The oscillating flow, the systolic spikes and the so called "zero Flow" are the transcranial Doppler signs of the ceased cerebral blood flow, and these signs can be used as one of the evidence of the brain death.
