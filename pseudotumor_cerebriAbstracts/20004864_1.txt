Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid pressure with no underlying structural or systemic cause. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, although well-described in adults, is rarely reported in the pediatric population. The usual presentation is similar to that of chronic daily headache, with some features of migraine. However, treatment modalities are different, and specific therapy can lead to significant improvement in symptoms. We describe six children with chronic daily headache, who were diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. The response to medical management was variable. One child required a lumboperitoneal shunt for persistent signs, with good surgical outcome.
