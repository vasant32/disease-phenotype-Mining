We describe a patient who developed unilateral papilledema after allogeneic BMT. This is a rare manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri, which results from elevated intracranial pressure caused by cyclosporin A. The papilledema usually involves the fundi bilaterally, but unilateral involvement has been described. Congenital anomalies, compression and adhesion of the optic nerve sheath are its causes. In this patient, the right optic fundus was spared although leukemic infiltration was present on this side and high-dose irradiation (72 Gy) was given. Although papilledema is a sensitive marker of elevated intracranial pressure, this sign may be masked by constriction of the optic sheath in patients who suffer from leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system and receive high doses of cranial irradiation.
