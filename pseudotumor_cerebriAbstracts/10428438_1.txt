A 6-year-old male presented with headache, vomiting, visual obscuration, and papilledema. Clinical presentation, initial laboratory data, and radiologic evaluation suggested a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. The development of lower cranial nerve palsies after transient resolution of symptoms prompted reassessment of the diagnosis, which revealed retropharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma involving the right jugular vein. Cerebral angiography demonstrated the complete venous occlusion at the jugular foramen. Careful neurologic follow-up is essential in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
