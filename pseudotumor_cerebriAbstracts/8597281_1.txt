PURPOSE: We used subtenon's local anesthesia for optic nerve sheath fenestration as an alternative to either general or retrobulbar anesthesia. METHODS: Thirty patients with pseudotumor cerebri, who were unresponsive to medical treatment, underwent optic nerve sheath fenestration after administration of topical and subtenon's local anesthesia. RESULTS: When topical tetracaine, in conjunction with subtenon's anesthesia, was administered at the beginning of the procedure, excellent anesthesia and maximal patient comfort were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The use of local anesthesia allows for a pain-free, expeditious operation with fewer potential anesthetic complications.
