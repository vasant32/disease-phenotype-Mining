A 4 1/2-year-old girl presented with cervical spine and radicular pain with hypoactive biceps and brachioradialis stretch reflexes. A diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made. The patient's symptoms resolved following the reduction of the elevated intracranial pressure. Abnormalities of the cervical spine and spinal cord were not detected. A mechanism to explain this "false localizing" sign is discussed.
