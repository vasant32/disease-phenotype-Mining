A septum pellucidum cyst is defined as a cystic structure between the lateral ventricles, whose walls exhibit lateral bowing and are 10 mm apart or greater. This communication presents computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in six patients with septum pellucidum cysts, ages ranging from 1.5 to 47 yrs. The width of the cysts ranged from 13 to 23 mm, and their walls were laterally bowed. Only one patient had hydrocephalus, who was surgically treated. The remaining five patients only had intermittent headaches. It appears that further studies will be required to establish satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for symptomatic or presumably symptomatic septum pellucidum cysts.
