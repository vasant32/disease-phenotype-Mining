Diagnosis of tuberculoma is difficult because of its tumorlike aspects. This report describes the case of a male who displayed a hemiplegia revealing an intracranial mass. Neuroimaging was consistent with a glioblastoma; however, the definite diagnosis was a tuberculoma. Clinical features of tuberculomas are nonspecific. Even though the neuroimaging features are sensitive, they are much less specific, with variability related to the tuberculoma course. Investigations leading to the diagnosis are histologic analysis showing a granuloma with or without caseating necrosis, and the microbiologic identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Every intracranial tumor with malignant radiologic and clinical appearance must evoke a suspicion for tuberculoma.
