The authors describe the essential neurological complications observed during the follow-up of glioblastomas treated by sequential chemotherapy. They were studied on the basis of clinical, isotopical, CT scanner and or anatomical data. The most frequent complications are: epilepsy, acute neurological deficiency and intracranial hypertension. The diagnostic significance of the complications are discussed. Usually, they expresse a tumour extension. However, the recurrence presents varied aspects. It can be infiltrating and extensed, multifocal, focal, cystic ou pseudocystic. In the majority of cases the morphological, topographical and evolutional characters can determine the therapeutical attitude.
