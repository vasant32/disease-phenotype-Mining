PURPOSE: To describe the hemodynamic effect of oral acetazolamide administration on ocular perfusion in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri associated with Crohn disease. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 20-year-old woman with a 5-year history of Crohn disease presented with a 2-week history of headache and blurred vision in both eyes. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Fluorescein angiography showed a profound delay in retinal and choroidal perfusion. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 320 mm water. Therapy was initiated with oral acetazolamide 750 mg per day. RESULTS: A subjective improvement of symptoms was noted over 4 days. Repeat fluorescein angiography showed resolution of the ocular perfusion deficit. No recurrent symptoms were noted 19 months after cessation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn disease may present with pseudotumor cerebri and severe ocular perfusion deficits that are reversible with oral acetazolamide therapy.
