Probable cases of pseudotumor cerebri were described more than a hundred years ago. A great deal of controversy existed regarding proper terminology and disease characterization. The clinical entity was doubtful before the routine use of ventriculography in the 1930s. Throughout history, many terms have been used, including serous meningitis, pseudotumor cerebri, otitic hydrocephalus, angioneurotic hydrocephalus, toxic hydrocephalus, meningeal hypertension, hypertensive meningeal hydrops, pseudoabscess, intracranial hypertension of unknown cause, papilledema of indeterminate etiology, intracranial pressure without brain tumor, benign intracranial hypertension, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
