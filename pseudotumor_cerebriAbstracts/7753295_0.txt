From a study of 48 cases of intracranial hydatid cysts operated on, we describe the clinical and prognostic aspects of this disease. This localisation is more prominent in children. The clinical picture is dominated by the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (96%) and the neurological manifestations (77%). The immunological data have little diagnostic value. The brain scanning is for us the most valuable diagnostic tool. The treatment is only surgical and the prognosis is good after the one piece enucleation by the Arana-Iniguez procedure.
