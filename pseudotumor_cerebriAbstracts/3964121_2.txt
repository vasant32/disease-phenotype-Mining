A 62-year-old man with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) syndrome was discovered to have a cholesteatoma of the left mastoid. The mass indented the sigmoid sinus without occluding it. The PTC resolved postoperatively. To our knowledge, PTC has not been previously reported in association with a cholesteatoma. Additionally, this case demonstrated that a partial obstruction of the venous drainage of the brain may be sufficient to increase intracranial pressure.
