Comparative data of transcranial ultrasonic dopplerography (170 patients) and radionuclide antroscintigraphy (124), received during diagnostics of defeats of venous collectors of brain are analyzed. Five variants of defeats of venous collectors (cross, sigmoid, internal of jugular vein), but also unpaired sine (direct, confluent) are described. Received results permit to reveal interrelation of infringements of venous outflow and increase of intracranial pressure.
