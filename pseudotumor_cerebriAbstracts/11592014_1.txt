CASE REPORT: We describe a fifty year old woman who complained of headache and transient blurring vision in her left eye. Visual acuity was normal and there was no pupillary defect. Ophthalmoscopy revealed left optic disc edema, whereas the right eye was tipified as normal. After discarding an ocular or orbital condition, neuroimaging and lumbar puncture leaded to diagnosis of Pseudotumor Cerebri. Symptoms improved after Acetazolamide treatment and lumbar punctures. A more detailed fundoscopy, as suggested ocular ultrasonography and CT scanner findings, revealed a mild papilledema in the other eye. DISCUSSION: Unilateral or apparently unilateral papilledema are sometimes signs of intracranial hypertension. Our case report highlights the difficult diagnosis of highly asimmetric papilledemas, and the possible delay of a neurological study.
