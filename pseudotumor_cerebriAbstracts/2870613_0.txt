During the time from 1982/83 the intracranial pressure was continuously measured from patients who were polytraumatized and also had severe head injuries. In 53% of these cases the first readings could be obtained within 6 hours after the injury and in 33% first after 12 hours. During the time of evaluation this relationship shifted to earlier implantation. From 27% of these patients the intracranial pressure values fell into a range that instigated immediate therapeutical measures. This proves how important it is to have a direct reading from the intracranial pressure as soon as possible after injury. The aspects of therapy by increased intracranial pressure were discussed.
