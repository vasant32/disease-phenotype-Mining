Risk factors, neurological, neuroradiological and ophthalmological features of 13 cases of acute pseudotumor cerebri were studied. After a 53-month period of mean follow-up, ophthalmological complications were taken into consideration: one patient (8%) showed unilateral optic atrophy with complete loss of vision, another subject complained of visual field constriction, and a third one of transient horizontal diplopia. Papilledema, which was present in 100% of the patients in the acute phase, persisted in 62%.
