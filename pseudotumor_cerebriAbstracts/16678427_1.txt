A case of spontaneous cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid leak after ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) failure in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is reported. This is the first report of spontaneous CSF leak in an IIH patient without a history of trauma, sinus surgery, or intracranial surgery. The diagnosis was confirmed using thin-sliced post-contrast computed tomography, which revealed a micro-dehiscence of the cribiform plate at the superior aspect of the ethmoid sinus. The patient underwent VPS revision without complication, resulting in complete amelioration of symptoms and cessation of CSF rhinorrhoea at 1 year follow up.
