Spectral and visual analysis of EEG was performed in 156 children with acute neuroinfections. It revealed some variants of EEG tracings, related to different grades of a compensation of intracranial hypertension (ICH), the changes in cerebral blood flow and a level of a damage of brainstem in dislocation syndrome. In patients with compensated and subcompensated ICH a polyrhythmic EEG was registered, while the changes in cerebral blood flow were moderate. 91% of the patients of these groups completely recovered. The patients with decompensated ICH and with mesencephalic level of brain dislocation had slow monotonous EEG; those with bulbar lesion had a suppression of bioelectric activity; a decrease of cerebral blood flow as well as an impaired autoregulation were observed. 5 patients from this group died, and the others survived with neurologic impairments of different degree. The conclusion was made about the dependence of EEG character in acute period of neuroinfection on the grade of the elevation of intracranial pressure and on the level of the brainstem damage and about the possibility to prognose an outcome of the disease on the basis of EEG characteristics.
