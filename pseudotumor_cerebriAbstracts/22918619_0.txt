 PURPOSE: The current surgical management strategies for refractory cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) remain unresolved. We evaluated the outcome of our paediatric patients who were offered a CSF diversion procedure in order to control their symptoms. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical notes of the patients under 16 years of age, who presented in our centre from 2005 to 2010, with a confirmed diagnosis of IIH, and ultimately had a lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS). We describe their immediate postoperative course, shunt-related complications and recent outcome. RESULTS: Seven patients presented at a mean age of 8.7 years. Two presented with significant visual loss and had a shunt acutely; the remaining five presented with headaches and were shunted within 2 years. In the immediate postoperative period two patients experienced low-pressure symptoms. All patients required shunt revisions; in total 15 revisions took place, mainly secondary to symptomatic overdrainage or obstruction. After a mean follow-up of 26 months, two patients have diminished visual acuity at least on one side; only one patient became headache-free, despite resolution of the CSF pressure post diversion in four out of the six remaining patients. CONCLUSIONS: All patients required shunt revisions and 6/7 (85.7 %) had persisting headaches at their last follow-up. It is apparent that once functional, the LPS seems adequate to lower the CSF pressure but not effective in eliminating symptoms.
