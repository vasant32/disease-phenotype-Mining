A case of Behçet's diease with massive hemoptyis is described. The hemoptysis occurred during disease exacerbation with extensive oropharyngeal and laryngeal ulcerations, and responded to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Other unusual manifestations included a light sensitive dermatitis, pseudotumor cerebri, and right bundle branch block. Also, arteritis and subsequent occlusion of the femoral and popliteal arteries occurred. Although uncommon, pumonary involvement may be life-threatening and should be treated with corticosteroids. Both pulmonary and neurologic involvement tend to occur with active aphthosis and respond to corticosteroids. This case underscores the protean nature of the organ system involvement in Behçet's disease and supports the concept that vasculitis is a primary pathophysiologic event.
