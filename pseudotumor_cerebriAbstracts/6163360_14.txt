A 32-year-old obese woman with hypertension and a three-year history of pseudotumor cerebri developed bilateral juxtapapillary subretinal neovascular membranes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral subretinal neovascular membranes complicating the course of this disease. The subretinal neovascular membrane in the left eye spontaneously involuted, but because the membrane in the right eye threatened the foveola, the patient underwent argon-laser photocoagulation. The subretinal fluid and hemorrhage progressively resolved, the membrane was replaced by fibrous tissue, and visual acuity improved. The pathogenesis of the subretinal neovascular membranes was presumably secondary to pressure deformity of the border of Bruch's membrane at the optic disk, creating a discontinuity of normal anatomic apposition of the chorioretinal layers. This anatomic dehiscence, coupled with hypoxia created by axonal tissue swelling and resultant impaired vascular perfusion of the tissues, led to the development of subretinal neovascular membranes.
