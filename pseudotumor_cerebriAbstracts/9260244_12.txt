Intracranial hypertension with papilledema has been reported in renal patients, but a survey of the literature suggests that the incidence rate is low. We present reports of 15 of approximately 1,670 patients with renal disorders, who were treated with growth hormone for impaired growth and subsequently developed symptoms and/or signs of intracranial hypertension. The male:female ratio was 6.5:1, and the median age was 12 years. The median duration of growth hormone treatment before onset of symptoms or signs was 13 weeks. All but 2 patients were symptomatic. In the patients in whom growth hormone therapy is known to have been discontinued, the symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension abated. At least 4 of these patients experienced a recurrence when re-exposed to growth hormone. Many of the affected patients presented with predisposing conditions, but growth hormone appears to have been the precipitating factor. Prospective funduscopic evaluation may be warranted in patients with renal disorders who are receiving growth hormone.
