Cerebral venous sinus compression can mimic idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The authors report the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with diplopia and papilledema 3 weeks after a head injury. Lumbar puncture confirmed raised intracranial pressure, and neuroimaging subsequently identified a skull fracture compressing the right transverse sinus. Papilledema and diplopia resolved following surgical elevation of the bone fragment. Computer tomography or magnetic resonance venography are indicated in children presenting with isolated intracranial hypertension following head injury to exclude cerebral venous sinus compression secondary to skull fracture.
