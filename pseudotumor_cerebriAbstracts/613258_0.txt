In the treatment of craniosynostosis methods have been proposed to prevent craniectomies from early reclosure. New bone is formed at the edge of the craniectomy but particularly at the outer surface of the dura. The author has developed a method to separate the edges from each other and to stop osteogenesis inside the craniectomy. The outer layer of the dura is dissected free from the inner layer, folded over the edge of the groove and sutured to the outer periosteum. The operative technique and the results in 40 patients with a follow up of up to 17 years are described.
