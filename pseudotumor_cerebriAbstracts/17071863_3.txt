Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Although a stenosis of the transverse sinus has been observed in many IIH patients, the role this feature plays in IIH is in dispute. In this paper, a lumped-parameter model is developed for the purpose of analytically investigating the elevated pressures associated with IIH and a collapsible transverse sinus. This analysis yields practical predictions regarding the degree of elevated ICPs and the effectiveness of various treatment methods. Results suggest that IIH may be caused by a sufficiently collapsible transverse sinus, but it is also possible that a stenosed sinus may persist following resolution of significant intracranial hypertension.
