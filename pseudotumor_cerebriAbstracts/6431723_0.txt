Patients with defects of the cranial bones were followed up for from one to ten years and over by employing clinical, electrophysiological, psychological, and social research methods. Combined assessment of cerebral dysfunctions showed the presence of general cerebral symptomatology which, in the period of decompensation, manifested itself in hypertensive and hypothalamic crises, as well as in psychopathological disturbances. The latter were controlled by courses of rehabilitation treatment. In the period between the crises, the patients with a substituted defect of the cranial bones were capable of many kinds of working activities, which suggests that the acknowledgement of an "anatomical defect" in which event the degree of disability is established once and for all is warranted only in cases of unsubstituted defects of the cranial bones (3 X 1 cm, according to the Manual of identifying the degree of disability, 1956).
