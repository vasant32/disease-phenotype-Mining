We report five patients with monocular temporal visual field abnormalities who did not have clinically detectable relative afferent pupillary defects. The causes for the field defects were posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, pseudotumor cerebri, and traumatic optic neuropathy. We discuss the possible explanations for our observations, considering the known anatomy of the pregeniculate visual pathways and the afferent pupillary pathways.
