Cases of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea without a clear etiology are known as spontaneous CSF leaks. Spontaneous CSF leaks most commonly occur in the ethmoid skull base or lateral sphenoid and rarely stop without surgical intervention. This chapter reviews the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and treatment of patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea. Specific attention will be given to endoscopic methods of repair and the importance of idiopathic intracranial hypertension as a possible comorbidity and contributing factor.
