The authors present a case history of a meningeal arteriovenous malformation, presenting as a pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. Subarachnoid hemorrhage did not occur and brain configuration was normal on CT-scan. The pathogenesis of papilledema in this case is discussed. Probably the cause must be sought in the massive overload of the venous return, resulting in increase of cerebral blood volume, impairment of CSF absorption and increase of CSF production. The common denominator and final pathway in intracranial hypertension, also directly responsible for papilledema, is CSF hypertension.
