The author establish an onerall picture of cerebellar infarction with brain stem compression after reviewing 63 cases published in the literature and 4 personal observations. The frequency of this affection can be compared with that of cerebellar hematomas. Diagnosis is based on its predominance in males, the early age at which it appears, its rapid and typical onset, and the delayed signs of brain stem compression. Conventional neuroradiological procedures show an expanded cerebellar volume, and the scanner can specify the ischaemic nature of the lesion. As soon as changes in consciousness occur surgical decompression is necessary, first by external drainage of C.S.F. and later, if necessary, by direct access to the postdrior fossa.
