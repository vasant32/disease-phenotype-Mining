Cerebral oedema, it has been suggested, may have a role in the pathophysiology of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). We applied diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI), a technique able to detect cerebral oedema, to the study of patients with BIH. A quantitative regional analysis of diffusion parameters (trace and relative anisotropy) was conducted by comparing five BIH patients and six healthy controls. A small but significant increase in anisotropy accompanied by a small but significant decrease in trace was found in the putamen and head of the caudate nucleus. No significant changes were demonstrated in the thalamus, cerebral white matter or cortical regions. Our findings support other recent work that suggests cerebral oedema is not a factor in the pathogenesis of BIH.
