Thirteen black patients with diagnoses of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) were treated in Howard University (Freedmen's Hospital) between 1962 and 1974. These patients presented features similar to others reported with this syndrome as regards age, sex, habitus, menstrual irregularities, treatment, and prognosis. There was no suggestion of higher incidence of the syndrome in blacks. This paper emphasizes the unknown etiology. Only a complete patient work-up, including hemoglobin genotype, endocrine study, pulmonary function tests, blood and cerebrospinal fluid gases and, where applicable, brain Po(2), Pco(2) and pH can serve as a reasonable prelude to an experimental model for studying the pathophysiology of this poorly understood syndrome and a more rational basis for therapy. A review of the literature dealing with suspected etiology, diagnosis, and therapy is also presented.
