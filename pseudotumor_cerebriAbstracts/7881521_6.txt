We report on the development of juxtapapillary subretinal neovascular membrane and permanent severe visual loss in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri. The patient was managed by a lumboperitoneal shunt. After surgery, despite resolving papilledema and intracranial pressure control, the membrane had enlarged rapidly to involve the foveal avascular zone, and resulted in rapid visual loss. The membrane slowly regressed, and was replaced by fibrous tissue at the ninth month, causing permanent severe visual loss.
