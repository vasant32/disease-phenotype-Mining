The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of barbiturate therapy as an adjunctive treatment for control of intracranial hypertension when conventional methods failed. To this end, a retrospective chart review was conducted on 21 neurosurgical trauma patients with uncontrolled intracranial pressure (ICP) admitted to a trauma/intensive care unit. In this patient population, the overall mortality was 48%. Control of ICP was achieved in 67% of patients. The survival of patients experiencing ICP control with barbiturate coma was better than those patients who failed therapy (71% vs 14%, p = 0.021). Thus, in a subgroup of neurosurgical trauma patients who are refractory to conventional management of elevated ICP, barbiturates appear to improve survival, suggesting that this therapy has an important role in the management of neurotrauma patients.
