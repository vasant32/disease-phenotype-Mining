PURPOSE: The idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can lead to a fatal issue in presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM). METHOD: We report the case of an obese pregnant woman presenting intracranial hypertension without cerebral CT scan anomaly. The situation worsened in spite of acetazolamide use: alteration of the neurologic state and the ocular motility. RESULTS: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a type I ACM. The decompression of the cerebrospinal fluid by superior way is performed (pressure at 60 mmHg, normal composition) and followed by the neurosurgical cure of the Chiari. This allowed a total recuperation. CONCLUSION: The IIH can be responsible for the decompensation of an ACM. A MRI and a rapid neurosurgical surgery are the rules without lumbar puncture temptation which can be fatal.
