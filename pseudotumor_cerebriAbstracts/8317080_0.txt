A total of 134 pregnant women with congestive optic disks were followed up, 16 of these in the postpartum period. Cerebrovascular disorders were responsible for this condition in 36 (26.4%) patients, inflammatory diseases of the nervous system in 33 (24.6%), benign intracranial hypertension in 26 (19.4%), brain tumors in 20 (14.9%), grave forms of late gestosis in 10 (7.4%), traumatic cerebral arachnoiditis in 5 (3.7%) and developmental defects of the skull in 4 (3.0%) patients. Congestive optic disks were not always a sufficient reason for induced abortion. Pregnancy was terminated because of direct threat to vision in 13 (11%) to the 118 patients. In 8 cases medical abortions were carried out in the first pregnancy trimester, in 5 cases cesarean sections were carried out.
