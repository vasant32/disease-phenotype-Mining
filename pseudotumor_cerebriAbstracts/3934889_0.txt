The results of clinicophysiological and clinicobiochemical examinations of over 400 children with closed craniocerebral injury (CCCI) were analyzed. The authors studied the parameters of the hemodynamics, respiration and also of electrolyte, carbohydrate and catecholamine metabolism. Relationships between the consequences of CCCI and the reactivity of the higher vegetative centres and some mechanisms of realization of high sympathetic activity of the blood were elucidated. The effect of some drugs on the studied parameters of homeostasis was elucidated.
