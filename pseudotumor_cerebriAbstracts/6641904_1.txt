Pulmonary hemodynamics and fluid and protein exchange were examined in dogs subjected to three successive periods of intracranial hypertension. Results indicate that the alteration in lung fluid balance is due to increased microvascular surface area following capillary recruitment. The relationship to the mechanism of neurogenic pulmonary edema is discussed.
