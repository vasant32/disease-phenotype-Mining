We describe a patient with papilledema due to benign intracranial hypertension who had sudden, painless monocular visual loss. Fear of further visual deterioration prompted vigorous therapeutic efforts to reduce intracranial pressure. Subsequent neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation disclosed that the visual loss was due to a subretinal neovascular membrane. Vision continued to improve after medical therapy was discontinued, and was accompanied by complete resolution of papilledema and headache. In any patient with minimal papilledema, sudden visual deterioration should initiate a search for other causes rather than zealous therapeutic efforts to reduce intracranial pressure.
