The effects of the venom of the male Sydney funnel-web spider were studied in closely monitored monkeys, and a number of new features were observed. Excessive catecholamine release was demonstrated and linked to the development of hypertension, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia, and metabolic acidosis. Acute intracranial hypertension was found, and may partly explain the central neurological manifestations. It is believed that a neurogenic basis for pulmonary oedema may sometimes exist. Survival after massive envenomation was achieved with the use of aggressive pharmacological denervation of the motor and autonomic nervous systems.
