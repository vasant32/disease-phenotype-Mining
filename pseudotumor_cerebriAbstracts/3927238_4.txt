Pseudotumor cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension is a syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure without focal signs of neurologic dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome are usually headache and/or disturbance of vision. Although tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo have been described in association with intracranial hypertension, otologic symptomatology as the presenting manifestation of this syndrome has not been previously reported. In this article we report the otologic symptoms and findings of two pseudotumor cerebri patients, one of whom presented with pulsatile tinnitus. The pathogenesis of the otologic symptoms, diagnostic workup, and management of these patients are discussed.
