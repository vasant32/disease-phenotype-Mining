This is a case report of a 15-year-old boy who developed benign intracranial hypertension after 3 weeks of levofloxacin intake. The headache, diplopia, and papilledema resolved within a week after levofloxacin was withdrawn. Physicians must be aware that quinolone antibiotics can potentially cause intracranial hypertension.
