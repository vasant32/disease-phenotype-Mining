A 17-year-old girl with acute pomyelocytic leukemia (APL) went into complete remission following Daunorubicin, Ara-C and ATRA chemotherapy for 1 month. Unfortunately, prolonged administration of ATRA 6 weeks later caused binocular diplopia with left abducent nerve paresis, which gradually disappeared upon withdrawal of ATRA. We propose that it is ATRA induced pseudotumour cerebri and present this case to discuss the relationship between the ATRA and pseudotumour cerebri.
