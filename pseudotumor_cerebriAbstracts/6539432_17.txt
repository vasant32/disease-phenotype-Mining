Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is most commonly seen in obese women of reproductive age. We studied 109 women with PTC between ages 16 and 44 years. In 11, PTC started during pregnancy. Thirteen women with previous diagnosis of PTC, including two of the aforementioned 11, had an additional 17 documented pregnancies. Patients were matched by age and parity with controls. Obstetric complications occurred more frequently in the controls. Visual loss occurred with the same frequency in pregnant and nonpregnant patients. Treatment of PTC patients in pregnancy should be the same as for nonpregnant PTC patients, except that calorie restriction and diuretic use are contraindicated. Obstetric management is no different from that of normal pregnancy.
