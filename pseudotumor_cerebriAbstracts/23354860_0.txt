Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in paediatric age with clinical characteristics that may differ from adult presentation. The authors present a case of an 11-year-old boy, presenting with severe holocranial headaches for the past 4 weeks. Best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were 20/200 bilaterally and the fundus examination showed marked bilateral optical disc and macular oedema. CT scan with contrast as well as MRI showed no space occupying lesions, normal permeability of the dural venous sinuses and a partially empty sella. Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 540 mm Hg, with clear cerebrospinal fluid, with normal biochemistry and cytology. The patient was treated medically and subsequently submitted to a ventriculoperitoneal shunting procedure. 3 months after surgery the symptoms got completely resolved and his BCVA were 20/20 bilaterally.
