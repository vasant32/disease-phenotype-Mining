A population of 41 non-hydrocephalic patients in whom a lumbo-peritoneal shunt (LPS) was inserted for various conditions is reviewed. 19 had persistent cerebro-spinal fluid rhinorrhoea following cranial injury, basal skull surgery or of unknown origin, 3 had recalcitrant benign intra-cranial hypertension, 14 had a persistent bulging craniotomy site after operations for intra-cranial tumours or head trauma, 4 had syringomyelia and 1 had a postoperative cervical meningocele. There was no shunt-related mortality. LPS was effective in treating the initial symptomatology in 31 patients. Further revision or removal of LPS were needed on 9 occasions in 8 patients showing shunt-related mechanical or infectious complications or persistent postural headaches. This report demonstrates the safety of the LPS procedure experienced in another population of 146 patients with communicating hydrocephalus operated on in the meantime. According to the authors' experience, the versatility of the clinical applications of LPS seems well established. LPS should be considered when a CSF diversion is required in patients showing absent or minimal ventricular enlargement in the CT scan.
