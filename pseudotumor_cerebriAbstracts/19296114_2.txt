INTRODUCTION: Chiari I malformation is associated with a small posterior fossa which cannot accommodate a growing hindbrain. Pseudotumor cerebri has been linked to developmental posterior fossa malformations. CASE REPORTS: The authors present two cases of early-deterioration post-Chiari I malformation surgery in a young and an adult patient, which were linked to raised intracranial pressure and had a stormy post-operative period. The pathophysiology of pseudotumor cerebri in early post-operative complications of Chiari malformation surgery is addressed along with arguments favoring its association. DISCUSSION: Potential clinical risk factors and red flags linking pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari malformation patients are discussed. The management of post-operative complications produced by the association is addressed.
