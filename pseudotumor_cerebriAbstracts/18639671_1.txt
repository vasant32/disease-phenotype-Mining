A 12-year-old boy presented with a weight of 136 kg and a history of progressive vision loss associated with unremitting pseudotumor cerebri requiring bilateral optic nerve sheath decompression. He underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) without complication. At 36 months post-RYGBP, he has grown 5 cm since the time of surgery, his weight is 6.8 kg above his postoperative nadir weight of 68.2 kg, and his visual acuity has improved with OD 20/100 (preoperative, 20/200) and OS 20/70 (preoperative, 20/100). This case suggests that RYGBP can be performed safely and without stopping linear growth in carefully selected children.
