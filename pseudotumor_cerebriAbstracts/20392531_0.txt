 OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, surgical treatment, and outcome of patients with spontaneous dural defect of temporal bone and to explore the possible contribution of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with spontaneous defects of the temporal bone were reviewed. Clinical presentation, diagnostic process, exploration of benign intracranial hypertension, surgical management, and outcome of patients are presented. RESULTS: Six of the 12 patients presenting with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea were women. Ages ranged from 38 to 76 years. Seven patients presented with meningitis. The location and the extent of the occurring defect were detected by computed tomography in all cases. Radiologic signs of empty sella syndrome, indicator of benign intracranial hypertension, were revealed in 3 cases using magnetic resonance imaging. Six tegmen defects were repaired using a middle fossa approach without recurrence. Four patients received the combined approach. All patients had complete resolution of the cerebrospinal fluid leak, although 2 cases developed adverse effects attributable to surgical procedure. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea requires clinical suspicion in the setting of meningitis and persistent serous otitis media. High-resolution computed tomography can confirm the diagnosis. The authors' findings advocate the multilayered closure technique through a middle fossa approach.
