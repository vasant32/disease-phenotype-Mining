A special entity called subdural effusion with ruptured subarachnoid effusion, which was diagnosed by CT, air study, and RI cisternography, was observed in 14 children of up to 10 months of age. 10 cases that showed symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) were treated by temporary subdural-peritoneal (S-P) shunt, and the remaining 4 cases that showed no symptoms of increased ICP were treated conservatively. 9 of the 10 cases treated by S-P shunt and 2 of the 4 cases treated conservatively showed good results. Poorly balanced absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the special transitional period of the CSF dynamics may be thought to be a pathogenetic factor.
