Ultrasonography was used to measure the standing of the optic disk (OD) and the diameter of the orbital segment of the optic nerve together with its tunics in a control group of the examinees, in patients with different stages of optic disk disease (ODD) and with clinical signs of intracranial hypertension in the absence of the ophthalmoscopic pattern of ODD. Eleven healthy volunteers and 168 patients with intracranial hypertension induced by brain tumors, hydrocephalus, and benign intracranial hypertension were examined. Ultrasonography revealed that there was a great difference in the standing of OD into the vitreous body in different stages of ODD, as evidenced by their comparison with that in the control group (healthy individuals), and a significant increase in the diameter of the optic nerve subtunicary space in patients with intracranial hypertension as compared with the controls. Intracranial hypertension regression as demonstrated by ultrasonography leads to a concurrent reduction in the previously increased diameter of the optic nerve subtunicary space and the standing of OD into the vitreous body.
