A 26-year-old primiparous patient with intractable benign intracranial hypertension treated by cerebrospinal fluid drainage through an indwelling spinal catheter was expecting twins. At 30 weeks she presented for emergent cesarean delivery secondary to a non-reassuring fetal condition. In consultation with the neurosurgical team, spinal anesthesia for the cesarean delivery was induced successfully through the spinal catheter. Cesarean delivery proceeded uneventfully with a favorable neonatal outcome.
