Oxidative damage in three inflammatory neurological disorders; Guillain Barr√© syndrome (GBS), multiple sclerosis and aseptic meningitis, were assessed by measuring the peroxidation of lipids in body fluids. The results were compared to a control group consisting of patients with either migraine, chronic/tension headaches, benign intracranial hypertension or psychological disorders. Antioxidant status was assessed by the measurement of the extracellular proteins, haptoglobin, albumin, caeruloplasmin and transferrin. The results of the study suggested that firstly, haptoglobin levels might be a useful, easily obtainable marker to aid the diagnosis of GBS. Secondly, free radical damage may be implicated in the pathology of GBS and therefore appropriate free radical scavenging might have beneficial effects.
