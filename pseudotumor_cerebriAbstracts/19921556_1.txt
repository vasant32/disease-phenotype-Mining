 OBJECTIVE: Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a complex syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any space occupying lesion, usually self-limiting, but often relapsing In recent years, some authors had researched the relationship between venous sinus disease and PC and they have suggested that it must be ruled out by magnetic resonance venography (MRV) before diagnosing this condition as idiopathic. Our aim is to determine the frequency of venous sinus disease and the need for MRV in these patients. METHODS: We have studied 14 patients admitted between 1998 and 2005 in the Neurology Department of the University Clinical Hospital <<Lozano Blesa>> (Zaragoza; Spain) who had been diagnosed of PC. We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical features. The MRVs were reviewed and their appearances rated for focal narrowing and signal gaps. RESULTS: Six patients had strong signal in both lateral and transverse sinus and their image was considered as normal. The other eight patients showed filling defects on the transverse sinus (focal unilateral narrowing in four cases, one or more signal gaps in four cases). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of signal gaps in the venous sinus (stenosis/hypoplasia or absence of signal) is a frequent finding in patients with PC. That is why we have concluded that this test is important in patients with PC in order to search for a possible etiology and treatment option.
