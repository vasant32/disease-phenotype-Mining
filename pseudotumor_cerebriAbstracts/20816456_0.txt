This chapter deals with non-vascular intracranial disorders resulting in headache. Headache attributed to high or low cerebrospinal fluid pressure is separated into headache attributed to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), headache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to metabolic, toxic, or hormonal causes, headache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus, post-dural puncture headache, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula headache, headache attributed to spontaneous (or idiopathic) low CSF pressure. Headache attributed to non-infectious inflammatory disease can be caused by neurosarcoidosis, aseptic (non-infectious) meningitis or lymphocytic hypophysitis. Headache attributed to intracranial neoplasm can be caused by increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus caused by neoplasm or attributed directly to neoplasm or carcinomatous meningitis. Other causes of headache include hypothalamic or pituitary hyper- or hyposecretion and intrathecal injection. Headache attributed to epileptic seizure is separated into hemicrania epileptica and post-seizure headache. Finally headache attributed to Chiari malformation type I (CM1) and the syndrome of transient headache and neurological deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL) are described.
