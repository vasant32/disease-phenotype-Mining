The effect of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, was studied in the treatment of 10 patients with head injury and one patient with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, each of whom presented with high intracranial pressure (ICP) (34.4 +/- 13.1 mm Hg) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) impairment (67.0 +/- 15.4 mm Hg), which did not improve with standard therapy using mannitol, hyperventilation, and barbiturates. The patient had Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 8 or less. Recordings were made of the patients' ICP and mean arterial blood pressure from the nurse's end-hour recording at the bedside, as well as of their CPP, rectal temperature, and standard therapy regimens. The authors assessed the effects of an indomethacin bolus (50 mg in 20 minutes) on ICP and CPP; an indomethacin infusion (21.5 +/- 11 mg/hour over 30 +/- 9 hours) on ICP, CPP, rectal temperature, and standard therapy regimens (matching the values before and during infusion in a similar time interval); and discontinuation of indomethacin treatment on ICP, CPP, and rectal temperature. The indomethacin bolus was very effective in lowering ICP (p < 0.0005) and improving CPP (p < 0.006). The indomethacin infusion decreased ICP (p < 0.02), but did not improve CPP and rectal temperature. The effects of standard therapy regimens before and during indomethacin infusion showed no significant changes, except in three patients in whom mannitol reestablished its action on ICP and CPP. Sudden discontinuation of indomethacin treatment was followed by significant ICP rebound. The authors suggest that indomethacin may be considered one of the frontline agents for raised ICP and CPP impairment.
