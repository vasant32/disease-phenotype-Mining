Forty-four patients aged 15 to 50 years with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) were under observation. There were 40 women and 4 men. 22 women had fallen ill during pregnancy, 4 during menopause, 2 patients due to hypothyrosis, 2 because of a respiratory disease, and 2 after a mild craniocerebral trauma. In 12 patients, the cause of the disease remained ++un-established. The "empty" turkish saddle was visualized in 5 women aged 32, 34, 46, 49 and 50 years. Pneumoencephalography and computer-aided tomography appeared to be of paramount importance in the diagnosis of the "empty" turkish saddle.
