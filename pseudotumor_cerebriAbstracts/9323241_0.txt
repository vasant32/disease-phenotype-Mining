A 14-year-old boy had a 1-month history of diplopia (due to a VI nerve palsy), motor ataxia and dizziness. Brain MRI showed a 1.5-cm mass posterior to the pons. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen showed the lesion to be of viral origin. After 3 months, the ataxia and dizziness had resolved and the MRI findings returned to normal. By 5 months the abducens paralysis had also resolved. Viral encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior fossa tumours.
