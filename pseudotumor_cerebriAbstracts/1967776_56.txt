Secondary pathophysiological insults occurring after injury have been prospectively assessed in 50 head-injured patients who required intrahospital transfer. 35 patients were transported from the intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 from the accident and emergency department. Physiological variables were recorded every minute in the four hours before transfer (ICU group only), during the move, and for four hours afterwards. Pretransfer insults were predictive of further insults during and after transport. There was significant correlation between increased frequency of insults post-transfer (compared with pre-transfer) and high injury severity score. A greater proportion of the patients transported from the emergency department had secondary injuries post-transfer. Adequate resuscitation before moving the patient, especially in patients with multiple injury, is important.
