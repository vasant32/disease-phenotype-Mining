Accurate volume determination of the encephalic ventricles is of importance in several clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's presenile dementia, schizophrenia, and benign intracranial hypertension. Previous studies have investigated the accuracy with which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used in clinical practice to evaluate the encephalic ventricles. However, adequate evaluation of pathological conditions depends on a sufficient amount of morphometric data from normal subjects. To begin establishing this data base for "normal" subjects, we evaluated the MRI scans of 38 subjects found to have no apparent pathology and calculated the ventricular volume in each case by using methods previously developed in our laboratory. The results were then compared with published volumes determined from studies that used either ventricular casts or computerized tomographic scans. The average total ventricular volume for all 38 subjects was 17.4 cm3, while that for males was 16.3 cm3 and that for females was 18.0 cm3. A small but significant correlation was found between age of subject and ventricular volume, with ventricular size increasing with age.
