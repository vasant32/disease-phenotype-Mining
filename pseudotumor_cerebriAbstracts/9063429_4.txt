Pseudotumor cerebri is generally a benign disorder. It has been reported to occur in hypothyroidism, particularly after the initiation of L-thyroxine replacement therapy. Previous case reports have involved children primarily in the peripubertal age range (approximately 8 to 13 years). We report here the development of pseudotumor cerebri in an infant who required treatment with L-thyroxine for transient neonatal hypothyroidism as a result of maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor-blocking antibodies.
