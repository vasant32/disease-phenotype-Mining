420 patients with cerebral cysticercosis, including 97 with intracranial hypertension, were treated by praziquantel 30-50 mg/kg a day, 7-10 days a course. Of the 420 patients, 252, 144 and 24 were treated for one, two and three courses respectively. 1-6 years' follow-up study showed 366 were completely recovered (87.14%) and 399 had effect (95.00%); 12 had inefficacy and 9 died (5.00%). It is believed that the serious acute allergic reactions might be eliminated by "desensitization" of a small dose of praziquantel; intracranial hypertension can be lowered by intrathecal injection of dexamethasone; and ventricular and intra-ocular cysticercosis can also be treated by praziquantel.
