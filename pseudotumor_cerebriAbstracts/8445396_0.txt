A male patient is reported with benign intracranial hypertension, who presented with three periods of partial pituitary deficiency, corresponding to episodes of headaches and papilledema. No radiological signs of the empty sella syndrome were observed. Since benign intracranial hypertension has been implicated in the development of the empty sella syndrome, it is postulated that the endocrine deficiency syndrome encountered in the empty sella syndrome can be provoked by chronic intracranial hypertension in itself and is not necessarily secondary to the anatomical changes occurring in the sellar region.
