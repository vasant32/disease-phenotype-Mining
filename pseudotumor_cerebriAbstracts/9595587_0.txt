We describe a case of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in a five years old child. Pseudotumor cerebri is a not very common syndrome in the pediatric age. The incidence rate in about 1:100.000. The prognosis of PTC is usually good. Sometimes however, PTC could be complicated by eye diseases such as reduction of visual field. Our case is a child with diplopia and with a bilateral oedema of the papilla. The diagnosis of PTC was possible after the physical examination and the instrumental exams (EEG, brain NMR and others). During the staying in the hospital the child performed a therapy with betamethasone and acetazolamide; the diplopia improved and the bilateral oedema of the papilla started to be less evident. The child was discharged in good health and with a planned ocular follow-up. We think that the Pediatrician must considered the possibility of the presence of a PTC; that is an important syndrome not only for the Neurologist.
