We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with HIV-seropositivity, who developed a clinical picture of pseudotumor cerebri, an association not previously described. The patient improved with the use of acetazolamide. We suggest the possible existence of this disorder in HIV-infected patients with persistent headaches, visual deficits and/or extraocular muscle palsies.
