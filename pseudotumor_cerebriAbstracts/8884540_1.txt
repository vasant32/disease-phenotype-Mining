Volume receptors are situated in many organs and are capable of modulating ADH secretion. We have evaluated the variation of plasma ADH concentration after an experimentally induced increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure (PCSF). The experiment was performed in controlled environmental conditions to avoid pain or stress-related ADH release. In 15 rats (10 experimental, 5 control) a cannula was positioned in the left cerebral ventricle: in the experimental group artificial CSF was infused at a rate of 0.6 (microliter/min for 6h: this manoeuvre, in a separate set of animals obtained an increase from 13.03 +/- 0.8 to 25.4 +/- 2.5 cmH2O of PCSF. The same conditions were reproduced in the control group without infusion into lateral ventricle. At the end of the experiment, plasma ADH had fallen significantly in the experimental group from 18.9 +/- 4.8 to 11.9 +/- 2.3 pg/ml (p < 0.05), while it was not changed in the control group (from 25.5 +/- 13.7 to 23.7 +/- 16.2 pg/ml). Heart rate, arterial pressure, plasma Na+ and osmolality, did not change significantly. Plasma K+ fell significantly in both groups: from 5.5 +/- 0.6 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.05) and from 5.4 +/- 0.7 to 4.3 +/- 0.15 mEq/l (p < 0.05) in the experimental and control group respectively. Plasma creatinine was normal, checked only at the end of the experiment. Our results demonstrate that a relationship exists between PCSF variations and plasma ADH concentration. We believe this relationship is due to the pressure receptors in the cerebral ventricles or in structures connected to it, such as the inner ear, and we hypothesize the existence of a control system of body fluids, more diffused than though to be, up till now.
