A group of 6 women diagnosed as suffering from pseudotumor cerebri had measurement of their plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels at baseline, following plasma volume contraction by furosemide and after dexamethasone therapy. In each instance, the values recorded fell within the normal range and a normal renin-aldosterone axis is postulated.
