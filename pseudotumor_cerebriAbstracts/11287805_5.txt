Twelve patients are described who were found to have asymptomatic intracranial hypertension monitored over an extended (6 months to 6 years) period. There were three groups: 5 patients with treated hydrocephalus with an apparently functioning shunt, 4 patients with untreated hydrocephalus, clinically and radiologically nonprogressive, and 3 patients with pseudotumor cerebri, 2 treated and 1 untreated. Although the magnitude of the intracranial pressure changes varied, all patients had abnormal baseline pressures together with repeated A and B waves. In no case was there any clinical manifestation of raised intracranial pressure and in all cases ventricular size remained constant over the period of evaluation. The clinical and pathophysiological implications of these findings are discussed.
