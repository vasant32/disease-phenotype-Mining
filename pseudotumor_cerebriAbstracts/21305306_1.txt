 INTRODUCTION: Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a syndrome characterized with increased intracranial pressure, normal cerebrospinal fluid content (CSF), and a normal brain on imaging studies. In this case report, PTC has been linked to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) that has been used for autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old boy, who was using MMF for 4 months because of the ALPS, suffered from occipital headache and vomiting with no other symptom. The initial physical examination was normal expect bilateral papilledema. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture which showed elevated opening pressure (590 mmHâ‚‚O) but no laboratory abnormalities of the CSF. A diagnosis of PTC was established. MMF was stopped, and the child was started on an acetazolamide treatment for 2 weeks. His symptoms and complaints recovered after this treatment. DISCUSSION: According to our knowledge, we report the first case of MMF-induced PTC in a boy with ALPS. This case illustrates that despite the rarity of MMF-induced PTC, the physicians should be aware of this possibility. Furthermore, in the setting of new-onset headaches or visual changes, early ophthalmologic examination for papilledema is recommended for early diagnosis.
