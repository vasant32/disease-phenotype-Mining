Several papers have suggested that pregnancy is one of the etiopathogenic factors of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). The therapeutic attitude to be taken as regards new pregnancies in women previously afflicted with BIH during pregnancy is still on discussion. This paper is based on a study of 100 BIH cases. The results support the idea that cases, but the obesity involved. The coexistence of BIH and pregnancy does not increase the risk of relapse, does not mean a worse prognosis of BIH nor does it appear to have a negative effect on the child. Any woman who has previously developed BIH during pregnancy should not be advised against future pregnancies. In the case of a new pregnancy, a very close control should be carried out in order to avoid an excessive increase in weight.
