PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) affords clinicians the ability to quantify the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), which is useful in managing diseases of the optic nerve. The purpose of this review is to coalesce the current literature on the use of OCT in neuro-ophthalmology to enhance its use in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: OCT's advancement into spectral domain refined its ability to measure the RNFL by increasing scanner speed. Although OCT was shown to be superior to other instruments in measuring the RNFL in certain conditions, it lacks laser polarimetry's ability to detect microtubule changes. Moreover, OCT's measurements cannot be used interchangeably with other instruments' assessments of the RNFL. OCT has been studied in several neuro-ophthalmic conditions, including anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis/multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, pseudotumor cerebri, migraine, optic nerve head drusen, compressive optic neuropathy, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. SUMMARY: OCT's wide use in evaluating the optic nerve and the visual system has revolutionized our assessment, management, research, and understanding of neuro-ophthalmic diseases.
