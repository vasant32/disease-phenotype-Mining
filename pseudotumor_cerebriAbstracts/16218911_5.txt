OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nature and course of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in Dubai, UAE. METHODS: In a retrospective study the medical records of 50 patients with IIH were reviewed. All of them were diagnosed according to the Modified Dandy Criteria. RESULTS: There were 46 (92%) women. Mean age at presentation was 35.7 years. Obesity was the commonest associated factor (32%). Headache was reported in 98% followed by double vision (32%). Papilledema was present in all patients at the time of examination (100%). Perimetric study showed mild peripheral visual field constriction in 56%. Only two patients showed severe field constriction and one of them deteriorated rapidly and she became blind. The mean cerebrospinal fluid pressure was 302.5 mmH(2)O. The visual status improved significantly throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has relatively benign course in this part of the world and more aggressive treatment is not recommended.
