A case of salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia with severe hyponatremic dehydration is presented. Clinical signs and symptoms of cerebral edema with elevated intracranial pressure were present. Conventional treatment was started, and after initial concern regarding future head growth and development, there was a good outcome with normal development at 1 year of age. This course is suggestive of benign intracranial hypertension. Possible mechanisms are discussed with a review of the relevant literature.
