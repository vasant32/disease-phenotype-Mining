We report a case of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) resulting from corticosteroid withdrawal. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to hospital because of an intractable headache. A neurological examination on admission showed no abnormalities other than a headache and nausea. CT, MRI, and angiogram examinations showed no abnormalities. Hematological and laboratory data were also normal. Continuous monitoring of her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure showed a value of over 25 mmHg during sleep, but papilledema was not observed. A diagnosis of BIH was made, with corticosteroid withdrawal considered to be the most probable cause. The patient was given isosorbide solution for 3 months. However, her clinical condition continued to deteriorate; she eventually began to develop visual loss, photopsia, and memory disturbances. She underwent lumboperitoneal shunt surgery, which immediately eliminated the headache, photopsia, and memory disturbances. She regained her vision over a five-month period. BIH should be considered as a differential diagnosis when an intractable headache develops after corticosteroid withdrawal, especially in young women.
