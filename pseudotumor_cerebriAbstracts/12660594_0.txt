We describe the case of a patient showing bilateral disk edema linked to amiodarone intake and discuss the controversial physiopathology of this condition. The clinical investigation as well as the follow-up of this case established the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced papillary disease. Pseudotumor cerebri and alteration of optic disk vascularization were also involved in the optic neuropathy displayed by this patient. This case illustrates the multifactorial character of this entity whose heterogeneous clinical expression is linked both to the direct toxic effect of amiodarone and the likely occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri, as well as to the disorders for which this type of medication is frequently used. Amiodarone is widely used and its implication as a cause of disk swelling should be systematically investigated.
