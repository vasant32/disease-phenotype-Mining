The case of a twelve year old child with intracerebral hypertension and cerebellar syndrome in whom the neuroradiological and neurological examinations were suggestive of posterior cranial fossa tumor is reported. The brain scan depicted the scintigraphic pattern of midline neoplasms, most likely medulloblastoma or astrocytoma. At surgery a Cysticercus cellulosae was removed from the fourth ventricle. The authors suggest that in geographical areas with high prevalence of neurocysticercosis in the infantile population the hypothesis of the pseudotumoral form of the disease be remembered when one attempts to characterize the type of neoplasms of the posterior fossa as detected by brain scan.
