Proximal migration of a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt is a rare complication associated with unishunt systems. We report three cases with a hypothesis that raised intra-abdominal pressure may be a factor responsible for the proximal migration of a LP unishunt. A rare case of proximal migration of LP shunt into the quadrigeminal cistern is also reported.
