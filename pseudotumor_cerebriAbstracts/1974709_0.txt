The role of intracranial pressure in the development and maintenance of the primary empty sella has been pointed out in the literature previously. The hormonal changes and clinical features have been evaluated in a 30 year-old female patient examined for a convexity meningioma and a 20 year-old patient examined for chronic hydrocephalus caused by cured meningitis. Histories and investigations revealed an empty sella turcica associated with primary amenorrhoea and delayed puberty. The removal of the convexity meningioma resulted in loss of amenorrhoea and a rise in plasma gonadotrophins. The establishment of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt did not bring about any changes in hormonal values and clinical features except the subjective headache disappeared. The importance of consideration of intracranial causes in patients who have delayed puberty or absence of menstrual history is briefly emphasized in light of the literature. Our data also demonstrated a correlation between an increase in intracranial pressure and a deficiency of hormonal secretion by the hypophysis.
