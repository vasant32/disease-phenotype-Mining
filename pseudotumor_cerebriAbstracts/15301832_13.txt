This study asked what incites the development of a new daily persistent headache in children. A total of 175 children with chronic daily headache were prospectively identified and observed by the author. Of these patients, 40 (23%) with a new daily persistent headache were identified. These patients had no significant prior headache history. Seventeen patients (43%) had the onset of their symptoms during an infection. Of these patients, over half had positive Epstein-Barr virus serology at the onset of symptoms. Nine patients (23%) manifested minor head injuries at the onset of their symptoms, yet had a normal examination and neuroimaging. Symptom onset was also associated with surgery (four patients) and high-altitude camping (one patient). In five patients, no specific etiologic factor could be identified. Four patients were initially identified as having idiopathic intracranial hypertension, yet their chronic headache persisted despite the normalization of their intracranial pressure. Similar findings were observed in episodic migraine patients who abruptly developed the onset of chronic migraine. In conclusion, the onset of new daily persistent headache in childhood is typically associated with a physiologic stress such as an infection, head trauma, or post-surgery.
