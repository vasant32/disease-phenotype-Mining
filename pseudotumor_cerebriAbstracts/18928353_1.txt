One of the prominent causes of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) syndrome is increased impedance of the venous outflow tracts of the brain. Theoretically, this is a justified mechanism for raised intracranial pressure; yet, there had been few cases of such a scenario reported in the literature, and to the authors' knowledge no case of PTC due to benign osteopetrosis has been reported to date. The present case occurred in a 19-year-old woman with a constellation of signs and symptoms compatible with PTC syndrome, whose radiological and laboratory studies confirmed the diagnosis of osteopetrosis. Magnetic resonance venography demonstrated bilateral jugular foraminal stenosis regarding the underlying disease process. The patient did well after she underwent a lumboperitoneal shunt insertion procedure.
