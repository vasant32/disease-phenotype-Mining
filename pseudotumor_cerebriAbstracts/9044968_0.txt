BACKGROUND: Optico-ciliary shunt vessels can occur in papilledema. It appears possible that the diameter of these vessels correlates with the pressure in the optic nerve sheath. CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri had atrophic papilledema with optico-ciliary shunt vessels at the disc margin. After optic nerve sheath fenestration these vessels collapsed and ultrasonography revealed a decrease in the nerve sheath diameter. Sixteen days later, the optico-ciliary shunt vessels were filled again. Nine hours after lumbar puncture, the optico-ciliary shunt vessels disappeared for 13 hours, but the nerve sheath diameter did not decrease. After acetazolamide, 1g q d, neither the diameter of the optico-ciliary shunt vessels nor that of the nerve sheath decreased. CONCLUSION: The diameter of optico-ciliary shunt vessels may be an indicator of the pressure within the optic nerve sheath.
