Antiphospholipid antibodies have been recognized as a marker for an increased risk of thrombosis, including cerebral venous thrombosis. This is a clinical study of three patients who presented with features of raised intracranial tension. Investigations revealed normal CT of brain and CSF examination in two patients. MRI of brain revealed dural venous sinus thrombosis in all the patients and positive antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. All patients recovered with anticoagulant therapy. Antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pseudotumor syndrome related to cerebral venous thrombosis.
