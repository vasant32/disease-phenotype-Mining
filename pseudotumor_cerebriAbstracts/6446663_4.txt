A case of pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) in a 13-year-old girl is reported. This patient experienced menarche seven months before presentation, and subsequently developed acne which necessitated antibiotic therapy. She had been treated with minocycline hydrochloride (100 mg twice a day) for two months before admission to hospital. The role of minocycline therapy associated with menarche in the aetiology of PTC is discussed.
