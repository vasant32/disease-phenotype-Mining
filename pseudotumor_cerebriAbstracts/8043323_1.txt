The authors designed this validation study to determine the defining characteristics of increased intracranial pressure and the risk factors for high risk for increased intracranial pressure. Using Fehring's Diagnostic Content Validity Model, a purposive sample of 219 nurses validated 17 major and 16 minor defining characteristics of increased intracranial pressure and nine major and six minor risk factors for high risk for increased intracranial pressure. Ratings were similar among nurses with diverse educational preparation but varied among nurses in different specialty areas, suggesting that practice setting is important in nursing diagnosis validation studies.
