In a 53-year-old woman with papilledema and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) brain CT examinations failed to detect the cause of papilledema, pseudotumor cerebri was suspected and lumbo-peritoneal shunt operation was performed to decrease the intracranial pressure. Unfortunately the patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage. The autopsy revealed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis to be the cause of papilledema, which indicate that sinus thrombosis can develop with such a hemorrhagic disease as ITP.
