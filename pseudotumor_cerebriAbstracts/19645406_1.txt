A 14-year-old girl had a 3-month history of headache and blurred vision. Funduscopy showed bilateral optic disc edema. Findings on brain imaging were normal, and a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was confirmed after lumbar puncture showed an elevated opening pressure of 32 cm H(2)O. Optic nerve head drusen were noted on computed tomography scan and confirmed with B-scan ultrasound. After 2 years, resolution of symptoms coincided with variable compliance to treatment with acetazolamide and concomitant papilledema. In general, optic disc edema poses a clinical conundrum due to the more common occurrence of optic nerve head drusen, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
