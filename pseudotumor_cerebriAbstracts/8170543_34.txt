We reviewed the efficacy of CSF diversion for pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in patients from six different institutions. Thirty-seven patients underwent a total of 73 lumboperitoneal shunts and nine ventricular shunts. Only 14 patients remained "cured" after a single surgical procedure. The average time between shunt insertion and shunt replacement was 9 months, although 64% of shunts lasted less than 6 months. Shunt failure (55%) and low-pressure headaches (21%) were the most common causes for reoperation. The vision of most patients improved (13) or stabilized (13) postoperatively. However, three who had initially improved subsequently lost vision. Six had a postoperative decrease in vision. Two patients improved in one eye but worsened postoperatively in the other. Four lost vision despite apparently adequate shunt function. Shunt failure with relapse of PTC occurred as late as 7 years after insertion. CSF diversion procedures have a significant failure rate as well as a high frequency of side effects.
