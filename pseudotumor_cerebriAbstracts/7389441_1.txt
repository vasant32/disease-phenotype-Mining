A series of 31 primary orbital mass lesions in patients up to 15 years of age is presented (malignancies: 5 sarcomas, 1 retinoblastoma; benign lesions: 7 optic nerve gliomas, 4 pseudotumors, 4 angiomas, 3 fibrous dysplasias, 2 dermoids, 1 hemiangioblastoma, 1 osteoma, 1 neurofibroma, 1 eosinophilic granuloma, 1 echinococcus). All the patients were operated upon using the subfrontal-extradural approach. The pathological and roentgenological features, and the long-term follow-up are analyzed. In the author's experience, computerized tomography scan (CT scan) is useful in planning the surgical approach more than in the pathological differential diagnosis. In orbital pseudotumors, without visual function impairment, CT scan is also useful in checking the results of conservative steroid therapy. The author's stress the importance of performing radical surgery, either along with (in benign lesions, including optic nerve gliomas) or followed by radiotherapy (in malignancies).
