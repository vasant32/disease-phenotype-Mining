A case of benign intracranial hypertension occurring in an 11-year-old boy, and due to lateral sinus obstruction, is reported. Computerized tomographic scan was conclusive, revealing a normal ventricular system and no evidence of a neoplastic lesion. Disappearance of the mastoid air cells and disruption of the trabecular pattern were also shown on the affected side. The diagnosis was confirmed at operation, and the course was favourable. In accordance with other studies cited, our findings suggest that patients suspected of benign intracranial hypertension can be spared invasive neuroradiological procedures if the computerized tomographic scan of the head is normal.
