One of 170 patients with karyotype-proven Turner syndrome from our institution has had pseudotumour cerebri. This patient and one previous report suggest that patients with Turner syndrome may be predisposed to increased intracranial pressure. Fourteen patients with pseudotumour cerebri were ascertained from hospital records; karyotypes of four were obtained and were normal. Karyotyping may be appropriate in women with pseudotumour cerebri who also have infertility, short stature, multiple pregnancy losses, or other features suggestive of Turner syndrome.
