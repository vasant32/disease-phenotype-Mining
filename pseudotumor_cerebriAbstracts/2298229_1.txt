Pseudotumor cerebri, or increased intracranial pressure without a mass lesion, has been associated with hormonal activity but the exact causative relation is still obscure. We report a case of a 15-year-old girl who developed pseudotumor cerebri manifested by headache, visual symptoms and extraocular muscle palsies 3 weeks after recovering from eclampsia. Possible associations with eclampsia and postpartum changes in estrogen, progesterone and prolactin are discussed.
