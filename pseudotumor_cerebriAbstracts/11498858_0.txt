OBJECTIVE: To differentiate and treat correctly the jugular bulb anomalies, as well as to avoid the unnecessarily enlarged operations. METHODS: Four cases of jugular bulb anunalies were reported and analysed. RESULTS: Two of 4 cases were misdiognosed as jugular glomus tumors; One was considered to be jugular bulb anomaly, but was done with an enlarged operation; another one was still accompanied with benign intracranial hypertension syndrome, was inappropriately treated. CONCLUSION: The jugular bulb anomaly was often misdiagnosed, therefore the anomaly should be differentiated from the jugular glomus tumor carefully.
