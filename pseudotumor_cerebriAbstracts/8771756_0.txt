The development of the benign intracranial hypertensive syndrome was shown to be followed by changes in liquorodynamic parameters and elastic properties of the brain. In 99% of patients, the baseline liquor pressure was elevated by 1.5-2.5 times as compared to normal values. Resistance of liquor resorption was enhanced in 82% of cases, suggesting impaired normal liquor outflow. The increased brain elasticity gradient suggests the exhaustion of cerebrospinal compensatory potentialities and correlates with the increased liquor resorption resistance. A correlation analysis of liquorodynamic parameters by taking into account clinical signs yielded a pathogenetic scheme of the development of the benign intracranial hypertensive syndrome.
