Reported is the case of a delayed cerebral necrosis in a patient with an eosinophil pituitary adenoma who had undergone radiation therapy. Neuroradiological tests were performed in order to verify the possible existence of a lateral sellar extension of the neoplasm. The administration of ketamine before this examination, presumably caused the onset of an acute temporal syndrome. Surgery was performed without delay, and a delayed cerebral necrosis of the right temporal lobe was found.
