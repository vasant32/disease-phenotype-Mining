Fifteen patients suffering from Benign Intracranial Hypertension due to various causes were investigated by measuring the CSF resistance to flow, and the pressure difference between the CSF and the sagittal sinus. Isotope cisternography was also performed, and the patency of the dural sinuses was checked by both sinography and phlebography. In twelve the results confirm a defect in the resorption mechanism, the nature of which proved to be venous in six, and linked to impairment of subarachnoid villi in six others. Three patients could not be classified. The significance of normal isotope cisternography is discussed.
