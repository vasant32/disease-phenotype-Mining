The authors report on a case of "benign" intracranial hypertension due to bilateral thrombosis of the lateral sinuses and internal jugular veins of infectious origin (otitis). A venous by-pass was established between one of the lateral sinuses and an external jugular vein. As early as the first post-operative week, the intracranial pressure was reduced and the visual disorders regressed. Such venous by-passes, now made possible by micromicrosurgical techniques, can be suggested for treating occlusions of the intracranial sinuses due to thrombophlebitis, traumatisms or tumours.
