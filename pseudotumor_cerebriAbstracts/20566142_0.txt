Summary: Pseudotumor cerebri remains a scarcely known pathology. We present the experience of a multidisciplinary working group which studied this disorder focusing on the venous alterations of the dural sinuses. Seventeen cases were studied, diagnosed, controlled and treated by our team. In one of the cases, we placed a stent in the left lateral sinus with good result. In all the patients we observed various degrees of stenosis in the brain venous sinuses quantified by pressure measurement. Nevertheless, to determine the exact cause of this pathology, more studies are necessary.
