Transient oculomotor paralysis developed abruptly in a patient with well-documented pseudotumor cerebri. Other demonstrable causes of third-nerve palsy were excluded. Sixth-nerve palsy is known to occur in 10 to 40% of patients in most series of pseudotumor cerebri, but third-nerve palsy has not been reported previously. It may also be a nonspecific sign of raised intracranial pressure.
