 AIM: Treatment options for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are lumbar     peritoneal shunt (LP), optic nerve fenestration, ventriculoperitoneal shunt and     venous stenting. We report our experience of 24 cases of LP shunt. MATERIAL and METHODS: All the patients had preoperative fundus examination, cerebrospinal     fluid pressure estimation and examination, visual field charting, CT scan and MR     venography. Postoperative fundus examination and visual field charting was done     in all cases. Follow up ranged from 18 to 137 months. RESULTS: Preoperative     papilledema, headache, decreased vision, optic atrophy and diplopia were seen in     24, 24, 19, 10 and 11 patients respectively. Shunt failure, CSF leak and     temporary over drainage complications in the form of headache were seen in 2, 1     and 15 cases respectively. Vision improved in 10 out of 18 patients. Only one     patient, out of 9 who had only perception of light and optic atrophy     preoperatively, had improved vision while all patients with vision of finger     counting or better without optic atrophy improved after shunt. CONCLUSION: LP     shunt is safe and effective in IIH. Results in terms of improvement in vision     were better in good pre operatively vision group.
