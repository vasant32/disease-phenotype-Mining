Thrombotic complications in children with varicella are well known. Transient protein S deficiency due to the presence of an anti-protein S antibody seems to be responsible at least in part. In an 8-year-old girl, pseudotumour cerebri with abducens palsy and ileofemoral vein thrombosis occurred 3 weeks after chickenpox. A transient elevation of anti-protein S auto-antibodies was identified. Under treatment with heparin the pseudotumour cerebri rapidly disappeared but the iliofemoral thrombosis persisted. CONCLUSION: Thrombotic complications after varicella might be mediated at least in part by antibodies against protein S. Early recognition of this condition permits appropriate treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator.
