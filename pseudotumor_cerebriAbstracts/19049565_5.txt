BACKGROUND: Whether cerebral venous sinus obstruction is a cause or consequence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the nine children with IIH, five showed stenosis (n = 5) and occlusion (n = 1) of cerebral venous sinus on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (n = 4) or conventional angiography (n = 1), respectively. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed in four children showed complete regression of the venous pathology in one and partial regression in two of them. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cerebral venous sinus obstruction is frequent and frequently transient in pediatric IIH and suggest that stenoses may result from elevated intracranial pressure.
