We study, in a prospective and randomized way, the influence existing between nursing maneuvers (suctioning, bathing and turning) and Intracranial Pressure (ICP) in patients diagnosed of Intracranial Hypertension Syndrome (ICHT). The study includes 22 patients admitted in Intensive Care at Hospital Universitario San Carlos (HUSC), during one year. All the patients had ICHT of traumatic or non traumatic origin. ICP was monitorized in every one through an intraventricular catheter and was over 20 Hg mm at admission or during 24 first hours of evolution. Doubt to the repercussion that the ICP values have on clinical evolutions we conclude that the nurse has to respond in an efficient, early and autonomous way in order to avoid uncontrolled elevation of ICP values during habitual management of patient.
