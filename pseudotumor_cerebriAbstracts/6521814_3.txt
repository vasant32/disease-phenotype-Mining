Sixty-seven patients with severe head injury underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (10 extradural and 57 intraventricular). All patients had Liege coma scale (LCS) score of 12 or less. Ventriculitis (E. Coli) occurred in one patient (1,8%). The intraventricular method allows C.S.F. drainage with lowering of I.C.P. even with slit ventricles. After 8 days, if an intracranial hypertension persists, we perform a ventriculo-atrial drainage. Pressure recording is a useful way of following the patient's evolution and a guide for prognosis of survival. If I.C.P. is constantly below 5 torr, then the probability of a bad outcome is great. The study also confirms the high mortality rate (93%) if I.C.P. is greater than 40 torr.
