Invasive recording of intracranial pressure (ICP) changes during cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion-drainage tests have been used to estimate elastance and reserve capacity of craniovertebral contents. The increase in ICP and its pulse-related oscillations lead to "cuff constriction" of cerebral veins. The purpose of this study is noninvasive assessment of elastance and reserve capacity of craniovertebral contents (RCCC) by measurement of flow velocity (FV) in the straight sinus by transcranial Doppler (TCD) during body tilt tests, which cause changes in ICP. The study was performed in 14 healthy volunteers (age 12-49 y, 6 men) and 32 patients with Intracranial Hypertension (IH) (Benign Intracranial Hypertension, n = 14; Brain Tumors, n = 18). The straight sinus was insonated through the occipital window during body tilt tests (BTT). Tilt table position was changed gradually from head up (+75 degrees) to head down (-45 degrees). It was established that systolic flow velocity and amplitude of FV pulsations (Amp) in horizontal position in patients is usually higher than in healthy volunteers. We found that reserve capacity of craniovertebral contents in patients with IH was usually exhausted. Elastance in patients was usually significantly higher than in healthy volunteers. Evaluation of cerebral venous circulation during body tilt tests clearly differs between the patients with IH and the healthy volunteers. The degree of this difference depends on the localization and character of the pathologic process.
