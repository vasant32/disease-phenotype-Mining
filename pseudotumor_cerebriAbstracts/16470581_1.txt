Secondary pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in pediatric oncology and hematology is an unpredictable and under-recognized condition. It is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of more than 25 cm H(2)O in the absence of underlying structural causes. Numerous conditions and medications have been implicated in the etiology of secondary PTC. Patients may suffer from incapacitating headaches and permanent visual loss, if they are not managed properly. We retrospectively analyzed the records of eight children, diagnosed with secondary PTC with an underlying hematological or oncological disease. Our study highlights the clinical features, contributing factors, and treatment options of this syndrome in children.
