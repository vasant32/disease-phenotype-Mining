This is a report of a 9-year-old female with a clinical presentation of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) who was found to have an unruptured pial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a significant fistula. The AVM was completely embolized using a recently developed liquid embolic system, Onyx, after which gradual clinical improvement followed. A few cases of BIH associated with AVM have been described in adults and adolescents. Possible causal relation is discussed.
