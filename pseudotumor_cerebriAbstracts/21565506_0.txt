We describe the phenomenon of paradoxical intracranial hypertension with upright posture with normal recumbent intracranial pressure (ICP). This effect was measured by direct ICP monitoring in a patient who had a lumboperitoneal shunt for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Bilateral subtemporal surgical decompression to increase intracranial compliance with confirmatory perioperative pressure monitoring was central to the successful management of this patient.
