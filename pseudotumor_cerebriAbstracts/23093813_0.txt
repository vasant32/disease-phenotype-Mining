Tinnitus is a frequent complaint in patients affected by intracranial hypertension (IH). Recently, some studies have reported an association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS). We investigated the relationship between BTSS and monosymptomatic tinnitus, regardless of its clinical characteristics, in subjects without clinical evidence of IH. We selected 78 subjects (all women, mean age 49.5 Â± 10.36) affected by tinnitus, without clinical history of audiological and otological pathologies, enrolled among outpatients of the Institute of Audiology and Phoniatrics in Catanzaro, Italy, over a 2 year period. All subjects underwent psychometric evaluation, psychoacoustic assessment, neurological and ophthalmological examination, cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRV identified BTSS in 17.9% (14 patients). In the BTSS group, tinnitus was bilateral/central in 21%, and monolateral in the remaining patients (50% left; 29% right ear). It was more frequently pulsating in the BTSS group, but 64.9% of BTSS subjects described their tinnitus as stable. No features of tinnitus showed statistical significance in association with BTSS. In BTSS subjects, we found values suggesting IH by lumbar puncture (LP) in 40% of cases. In these patients, LP gave immediate improvement of tinnitus. The association between BTSS and tinnitus, regardless of its features, must be considered when other causes of tinnitus are excluded.
