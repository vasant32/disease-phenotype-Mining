INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IICH) is characterized by a rising in intracranial hypertension without evidence of intracranial expansive disease. Diagnostic criteria of headache related to IICH are described in the International Classification of Headache Disorders. In clinical practice, however, headache related to IICH may be heterogeneous. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical charts of patients with IICH admitted to the Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin between 1990 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included, with a ratio female/male of 8.1:1. Headache was present in 85.4%. The headache was continuous in 63.8% of patients, and diffuse in 51%. CONCLUSION: Headache related to IICH is heterogeneous, and may mimic primary headache, so a high level of suspicion is needed to avoid diagnostic delay.
