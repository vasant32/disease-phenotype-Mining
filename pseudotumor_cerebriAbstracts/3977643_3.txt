Pattern reversal visual evoked potentials in 13 patients with pseudotumor cerebri were significantly delayed (99 +/- 7.3 ms [mean +/- SD]) compared with the findings in 20 normal subjects (94 +/- 2.7 ms), although only four patients had latencies outside the normal range. There was, however, a significant correlation between the intracranial pressure and the latency of visual evoked potentials. After medical treatment of the intracranial hypertension, visual evoked potential latencies decreased in patients who recovered and in whom the papilledema disappeared. In one patient with progressive visual failure, the visual evoked potentials were abnormal before disturbances of visual fields and visual acuity were evident. Repeated examinations of visual evoked potentials might be of value in patients with pseudotumor cerebri to ensure neurosurgical intervention in due time to prevent visual loss in patients with impending optic nerve atrophy.
