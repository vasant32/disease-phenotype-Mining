The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri is based on the triad of: (1) papilloedema,     (2) elevated intracranial pressure with a normal cerebrospinal constituency and     (3) normal central nervous system imaging studies. However, the diagnosis of     pseudotumor cerebri is not always straightforward. We report a 19-year-old     morbidly obese girl who developed pseudotumor cerebri associated with sutural     diastasis of the cranium based on the direct radiographies. Following a     ventriculo-peritoneal shunt operation, we demonstrated the closing and     perisuturally sclerosis on all major cranial sutures. A careful examination of     direct radiographies might be critical for diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri.     Prompt recognition, evaluation, and treatment are needed to prevent permanent     visual loss.
