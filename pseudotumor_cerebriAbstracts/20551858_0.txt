Among the sequelae of persistent raised intracranial pressure (ICP) are ophthalmologic signs and symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, visual field deficits, papilledema, and vision loss. Elevated pressure within the optic nerve sheath may not be relieved by shunt procedures, which can decrease generalized ICP. The authors present a case of acute visual loss in the setting of chronic hydrocephalus and multiple shunt revisions. Despite shunt correction resolving systemic symptoms of raised ICP, this child had persistent visual loss. Bilateral optic nerve sheath decompression was performed, and the visual acuity improved over the next 3 days. This case highlights the importance of routine ophthalmologic examination in patients with hydrocephalus and shunts and demonstrates the utility of optic nerve sheath decompression as a surgical intervention when shunting alone does not resolve visual loss.
