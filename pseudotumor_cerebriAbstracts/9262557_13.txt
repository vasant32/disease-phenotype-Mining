PURPOSE: To investigate sex distribution, frequency of obesity, and other associated conditions among children and adolescents with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients aged 18 years or younger diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension between 1988 and 1995 at two medical centers. Meta-analyses were performed using our data pooled with published information. RESULTS: Of 374 patients, 175 (46.8%) were male and 199 (53.2%) were female. Obesity was noted in 50 (29.6%) of the 169 patients for whom relevant data are available, and other associated conditions were noted in 185 (53.2%) of the 348 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension among children and adolescents affects boys and girls equally; concurrent obesity occurs less frequently than in adults; and other associated conditions or secondary causes are common.
