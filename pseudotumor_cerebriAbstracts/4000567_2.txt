Pseudotumor cerebri is a rare disorder occurring in the reproductive age range of females, thus occurring infrequently in pregnancy. We are reporting three cases and reviewing the reports in English since 1960. Presentation, diagnosis, etiology, treatment, and pregnancy outcome are discussed in this review of the literature. Overall, pregnancy outcome does not appear to be adversely affected and the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies does not appear to be increased. Medical management and observation are usually effective. Pregnancy termination is rarely, if ever required.
