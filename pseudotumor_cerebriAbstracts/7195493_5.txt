Extraovarian estrogen production was studied in an obese young woman with pathologically confirmed mosaic Turner syndrome and pseudotumor cerebri. Diet plus enough dexamethasone to suppress adrenal steroidogenesis promptly lowered cerebrospinal fluid testosterone. Estrone was detected in cerebrospinal fluid before and after but not during dexamethasone treatment. Extraovarian estrogen probably produces the menstrual irregularities of obese young women with pseudotumor cerebri and may be involved in the pathogenesis of that syndrome.
