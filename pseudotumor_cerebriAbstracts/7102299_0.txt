The cochlear blood flow was investigated in rabbits with the microsphere method before and during an induced increase of intracerebral and intracochlear pressures. The increase was accomplished by infusing Ringer solution into the lateral cerebral ventricles. The cochlear blood flow was found to autoregulate in response to decreases in perfusion pressures down to 5-6 kPa. This finding is discussed in relation to known effects of intracochlear and intracranial pressure on hearing.
