PURPOSE: To report a case of benign intracranial hypertension related to mesalazine use. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 23-year-old-woman with sudden visual loss, headache, and a history of ulcerative colitis treated with mesalazine underwent ophthalmologic examination, echography, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture. RESULTS: The examinations disclosed benign intracranial hypertension that resolved when mesalazine was discontinued and recurred when the drug was restarted. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend periodic ocular fundus examination for patients undergoing long-term therapy with mesalazine, especially if decreased vision, headaches, or neck stiffness are present, to avoid potentially severe complications of intracranial hypertension
