ABSTRACT:: A 14 year-old Caucasian boy with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) presented with blurred vision in his left eye. Visual acuity was 20/20, right eye, and 20/80, left eye, and funduscopy revealed bilateral papilledema. In addition, there was peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (PPCNVM) in the left eye. Oral acetazolamide improved the symptoms and signs of IIH, but seven weeks later, acuity remained 20/80, left eye, with an increase in subretinal hemorrhage. Two weeks following an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, visual acuity on the left had improved to 20/30 with resolution of subretinal hemorrhage and fibrosis of PPCNVM. After an additional 2 weeks, visual acuity improved to 20/20, and there has been no sign of recurrence over 3.5 years of follow-up.
