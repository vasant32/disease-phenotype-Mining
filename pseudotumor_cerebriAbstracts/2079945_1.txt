Blood flow velocities of the basal cerebral arteries were studied by transcranial Doppler sonography in a 6 year old girl, comatous after cerebral contusion. Under progressive increase of cerebral pressure, Doppler sonographic long-term monitoring of the middle cerebral artery was performed parallel to the intracranial pressure until dissociated brain death. The results correlated closely with the cerebral perfusion pressure. Even before onset of the excessive increase in cerebral pressure no hyperventilation effect was seen in the contusion foci. Transcranial Doppler sonography represents an additional monitoring method for further improvement of treatment of severe head injuries.
