The work is based on the analysis of 148 patients with decompensated craniostenosis who underwent operation at the neurosurgical clinic of Oran (the Algerian People's Democratic Republic). The specific features of the clinical manifestations of decompensated craniostenosis are discussed. Sixty-five patients were operated on by the method suggested by V. A. Kozyrev and A. A. Arendt, and 81 patients by a modification of the method (one-stage bilateral craniectomy). Catamnestic examination showed the suggested method to be highly effective in decompensated craniostenosis. No fatal outcomes were recorded.
