In five consecutive cases of pseudotumor cerebri we observed an elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate that we were able to correlate with the changes in the degree of papilledema. In spite of an extensive medical workup, no other cause for the increased ESR was found. Our findings suggest that possibly serial ESR determinations might be of assistance in following cases of pseudotumor cerebri.
