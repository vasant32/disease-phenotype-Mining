A retrospective study of standard EEG's obtained from 26 patients with benign intracranial hypertension was done with particular emphasis on the effect of age on the EEG findings. Abnormal EEG's were found in 10 patients, all were less than 20 years of age. Although no consistent pattern of EEG abnormality could be identified, there appears to be a difference between the immature and adult brain in the EEG response to intracranial hypertension.
