Sixteen patients were treated with shunting of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the cisterna magna for raised intracranial pressure (15 cases) or CSF leak (one case). There were 11 patients with benign intracranial hypertension, three with craniostenosis, one with chronic meningitis and one with a CSF leak. Cisternal shunting was effective in all cases and obviated the problems of low pressure and sciatica found with lumbar-peritoneal shunts. There were 11 revisions over a total of 31.5 shunt years (i.e. one per 2.9 shunt years). The role of cisternal shunting in neurosurgical practice is discussed.
