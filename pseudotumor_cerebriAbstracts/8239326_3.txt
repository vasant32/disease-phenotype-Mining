A 16-year-old girl complained about a headache of one-month's duration, accompanied by vertical diplopia that had appeared ten days earlier. The girl reported receiving vitamin A and minocycline to treat acne vulgaris for the previous six weeks. An examination revealed bilateral optic disc edema. Normal computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations enabled a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri to be made. Soon after discontinuation of those medications, the headaches and diplopia diminished. We suggest a periodic ophthalmologic examination during systemic therapy with vitamin A combined with minocycline to detect the early occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri.
