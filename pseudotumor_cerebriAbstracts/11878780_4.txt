This report encourages clinicians to consider a diagnosis of Carney's triad in patients with multifocal gastric stromal sarcoma, extraadrenal paraganglioma (predominantly mediastinal), or pulmonary chondroma. The authors conducted a retrospective 20-year survey at the Hospital for Sick Children and identified two children with Carney's triad. One child, presenting atypically with papilledema and fundal hemorrhages from malignant hypertension and benign intracranial hypertension from chronic iron-deficiency anemia, is the second patient ever to date be described with the complete Carney's triad of neoplasms at diagnosis. Another child presented more typically with gastric stromal sarcoma and pulmonary chondroma without paraganglioma. Carney's triad is a rare differential diagnosis for "idiopathic" hypertension or iron-deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. If missed, patients with Carney's triad may have the debilitating physical and mental consequences of chronic iron deficiency and may die of untreated prolonged hypertension and metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
