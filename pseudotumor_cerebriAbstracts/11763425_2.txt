Rare forms of demyelinating disease such as Bal√≤'s concentric sclerosis or Schilder's disease may simulate brain tumors, both clinically and on the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Even the histopathological diagnosis after a biopsy is not entirely reliable. We report three cases of pseudotumoral demyelinating disorders having required a stereotaxic biopsy, one of which was erroneously diagnosed as a malignant astrocytoma. We describe MRI especially the intense contrast enhancement with ill-defined margins, and the mild mass effect. We then detail the histopathological processes upon which differential diagnosis with a tumor can be based.
