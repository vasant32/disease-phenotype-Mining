Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma (PLML) is a rare disease. The most common presentation is symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Confusion, dysarthria, hearing loss, paraparesis and lumbosacral spinal root symptoms have also been reported. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been tried, but its prognosis is usually poor. We experienced a case of PLML with a relatively benign course in an 18-year-old girl. Initial diagnosis was made as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Lumbosacral shunt was done with good response for 3 years. When headache recurred, she was reevaluated and was correctly diagnosed as PLML.
