INTRODUCTION: The increased use of human growth hormone (hGH) in numbers of children rise questions concerning the safety of GH replacement therapy (GHRT). Adverse effects of hGH treatment (pseudotumor cerebri, papilloedema, retinal changes mimicking diabetic retinopathy, neovascularization) have been reported in some papers. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hGH therapy on the organ of vision. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 10 girls with Turner's syndrome aged 12-16 years (mean 13.8+/-1.69) and 20 patients with somatotropic pituitary insufficiency aged 7-18 years (mean 12.98+/-2.81) were studied. The mean duration of GHRT in patients with Turner's syndrome was 3.05+/-1.42 years (from 1 year to 5 year), in patients with somatotropic pituitary insufficiency was 2.45+/-2.32 years (from 8 months to 10 years). All patients underwent ophthalmic examination, including contrast sensitivity, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: All parts of ophthalmological examination were normal. There were no abnormalities in fluorescein angiography. Contrast sensitivity was correct in all eyes. CONCLUSIONS: There was no harmful effect of GHRT on the retina and optic nerve in young patients. The follow-up and ophthalmologic evaluation is advisable.
