Ocular-central nervous system malignant B-cell lymphoma initially caused diplopia and morning headaches in a 10-year-old boy. After initial diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made, based on normal findings from magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography elsewhere, he was treated with acetazolamide. Standardized echography demonstrated a combination of solid infiltration and fluid within the optic nerve sheaths. Lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure and cerebrospinal diagnostic of central nervous system (CNS) B-cell lymphoma, which was confirmed by gene rearrangement. Results of peripheral blood study were negative. Aggressive treatment with chemotherapy and external-beam radiation produced complete resolution of solid optic nerve sheath infiltration in both eyes. This report discusses the clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics of CNS malignant B-cell lymphoma with ocular involvement and its differentiation from pseudotumor cerebri.
