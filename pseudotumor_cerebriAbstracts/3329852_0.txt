CT-guided stereotactic aspiration surgery for the evacuation of hypertensive brain hemorrhage (HBH) has been introduced recently. From December, 1980, to April, 1986, we used aspiration surgery in 375 cases of HBH. The 6-month postoperative outcome of aspiration surgery for acute basal-ganglionic hemorrhage was compared with that after conventional surgery of all Japan and those after conservative treatment. In basal-ganglionic hemorrhage, aspiration surgery led to a favorable clinical experience and outcome, providing the possibility of a new avenue of surgical treatment of HBH.
