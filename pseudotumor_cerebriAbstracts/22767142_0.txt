All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces complete remission in 64-100Â % of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and is considered to be a safe agent. Pseudotumor cerebri is a neurological side effect of ATRA reported in pediatric patients, and which is characterized by raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the absence of any intracranial pathology or secondary causes of intracranial hypertension. Involvement of cranial nerves other than II and VI is very uncommon in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH); peripheral facial nerve palsy is exceptional and has rarely been described in the context of treatment with ATRA. We describe the case of a 15-year-old female patient with APL who developed an IIH and involvement of cranial nerves (bilateral papilledema, left facial and right sixth nerves) after receiving induction therapy including ATRA. Viral infections and other causes of secondary cranial nerve lesions were excluded. Symptoms completely subsided with the temporary withdrawal of ATRA and did not recur after reintroducing the drug. To date, the patient has managed to receive the treatment as per protocol. In conclusion, we report an atypical presentation of IIH that merits consideration, especially with respect to young patients with APL receiving ATRA; our most important observation is that the drug could be safely reintroduced once the symptoms had resolved.
