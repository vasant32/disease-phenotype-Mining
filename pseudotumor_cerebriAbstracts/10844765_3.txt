A 28-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 12 month history of secondary amenorrhoea, polyuria and polydipsia with fatigue and weight loss. Investigations revealed panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, an intrasellar mass and papilloedema, thought to be due to benign intracranial hypertension. She was treated conservatively. However, a repeat magnetic resonance image showed enlargement of the pituitary mass with compression of the optic nerves. The pituitary abscess was drained by a transsphenoidal approach. Postoperatively the patient received antibiotics with no recurrence of the pituitary abscess. Copyright 1999 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.
