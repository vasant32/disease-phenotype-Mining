 INTRODUCTION: We present a case of ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor cerebri in a 22-year-old African American woman. Withdrawal of ciprofloxacin in our patient resulted in complete resolution of ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor, as evidenced by a normal neuro-ophthalmic examination and a cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of 140 mmH20. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old African American woman presented with a headache of two weeks duration, visual blurring and horizontal diplopia after starting ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis. An ophthalmic examination revealed that she had left eye esotropia, and a picture of the fundus demonstrated bilateral disc swelling without spontaneous venous pulsations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a magnetic resonance venogram were normal. A diagnostic lumbar puncture demonstrated an elevated opening pressure of 380mmH2O in a supine position. Laboratory examinations, including a cerebrospinal fluid exam, were unremarkable. CONCLUSION: ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor can cause chronic disabling headache and visual complications. Therapy is sub-optimal, often symptomatic, insufficient and complicated by side effects. When ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor presents in an atypical population, an inciting agent must be suspected because prompt withdrawal of the agent may lead to complete resolution of symptoms and prevent recurrence of similar episodes.
