Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a syndrome characterized by the presence of intracranial hypertension (ICH) and no alteration in the ventricular system. Renal transplanted patients seem more susceptible to develop it due to immunosuppressive therapy. Cyclosporin (CsA) is a rare cause of PC, scarcely reported in the literature, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ICH and papilledema in those patients. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy, with a renal allograft for three years, on chronic use of mycophenolate mophetil (MMF), CsA, and low doses of prednisone. The patient presented with headache, vomiting, diplopia, and photophobia. Funduscopy showed bilateral papilledema. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and imaging tests were normal. After excluding secondary causes, PC was diagnosed based on the chronic use of CsA, which was then replaced by sirolimus. After that, the patient progressively improved, and the papilledema resolved in three months.
