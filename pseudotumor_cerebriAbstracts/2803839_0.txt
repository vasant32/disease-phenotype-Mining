A case of pseudotumor cerebri associated with iron deficiency anemia due to colon cancer is reported in a 37-year-old woman. Her initial symptoms were vomiting and severe headache. On physical examination, no lymph nodes and abdominal mass were palpable but marked anemia was noted in her skin and conjunctiva . Neurological examination revealed papilledema in her both eyes and stiff neck. There was no abnormal findings on CT scan on admission. Spinal puncture revealed CSF pressure as high as 620 mmH2O with normal cells, protein, sugar and chloride levels. Hematological examination revealed iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytosis. Angiography at third day revealed no sinus occlusion, but retention of contrast media was seen on the cortical vein of parietal lobe and right transverse sinus. Brain scintigram at sixth day revealed mild accumulation in left parietal lobe, so small venous infarction was suggested. There were two circumscribed stenotic lesions of right ascending colon in the barium enema, and right hemicolectomy was achieved. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma. The symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri was completely disappeared soon after the surgery together with resolution of anemia. She lives with no deficits now 1 year 3 months after surgery. In conclusion much attention is necessary to a patient of pseudotumor cerebri with iron deficiency anemia for the presence of cancer, because not only this central nervous system lesion is reversible and curable but also the cancer itself may be curable by surgery.
