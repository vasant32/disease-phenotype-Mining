Among our patients with benign intracranial hypertension, we encountered 3 who presented with unusual clinical features. Presentations were pseudotumor without papilledema, unilateral papilledema, and IIIrd and Vth cranial nerve involvement. Lumbo-peritoneal shunt completely resolved the symptoms and signs in 2 of the patients; in the third, symptoms and signs cleared following lumbar puncture.
