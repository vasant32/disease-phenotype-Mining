Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of increased intracranial pressure of unknown aetiology. Slowly progressing visual defects secondary to papilloedema are well-known complications. Rapidly progressing visual loss is rare. A case of acute and rapidly progressing visual loss in idiopathic intracranial hypertension is presented. Rapid recognition and treatment of IIH is important, and may occasionally prompt acute surgical treatment.
