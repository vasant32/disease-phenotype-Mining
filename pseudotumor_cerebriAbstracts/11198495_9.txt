Neurologic complications of systemic lupus cerebritis are not as well known in children as in adults. Twenty-five children with neurologic complications were identified after reviewing the hospital medical records of 86 children with systemic lupus erythematosus. Seven children (28%) had neurologic symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus; median time between diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and onset of neurologic complications was 1 month (range 0-5 years). Seizures were the most common neurologic symptoms overall, but headaches were the most frequent neurologic manifestation in children without a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Sixteen children had seizures, and 12 children had seizures as the initial central nervous system involvement. Almost all children who developed seizures had an established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus; only one child had seizures that led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. No patient had status epilepticus, and, in general, seizures were not difficult to control. In six children, headache was the initial symptom of central nervous system involvement. Five children had lupus cerebritis, three children had stroke, and two had isolated cranial neuropathies. Chorea was seen in only two cases, and three children had pseudotumor cerebri. Treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone led to a good response in 18 children; cyclophosphamide was required in 6 patients and plasmapheresis in 1 child. Outcome was generally good, although one child developed fulminant cerebritis with intracranial hypertension and died.
