A brief survey on the concept of the so-called pseudotumour cerebri is given, referring to a great number of synonyms. On the basis of the clinical data of 70 patients with diseases of the intra- and extracranial organs and without a recognisable basic disease, a continous development of the increase in the brain pressure from only subjective complaints to the syndrome of the benign intracranial hypertension in an extended sense and the most severe disease pictures with a lethal outcome are discussed. For lethal courses the term of malignant intracranial hypertension is suggested and the importance of computer tomography in the differential diagnosis and supervision of unclear brain pressure increases is pointed out.
