BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The radiologic diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is one of exclusion, with no reproducible positive features described in the imaging literature. Because MR venography is prone to flow artifacts, diagnosis of secondary intracranial hypertension (SIH) can also be problematic. Vascular hydraulics can be useful for diagnosis of these conditions when measured by invasive or sonographic means. The purpose of this study was to measure vascular flow and pulsatility characteristics with a noninvasive MR imaging method. METHODS: Twelve patients with clinical and lumbar puncture findings of IIH or SIH and 12 control subjects were examined with MR venography and MR flow quantification studies of the cerebral arteries and veins. Total cerebral, superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and straight sinus blood flows were measured. Pulsatility indices from the arterial and venous flow for all patients were compared using the Student t test. RESULTS: MR venography confirmed that seven of the 12 patients had venous outflow obstruction, and thus, SIH. The remaining five patients had IIH. All patients showed reduced sinus pulsatility compared with that of the control group; reductions of 42% in the SSS and 32% in the straight sinus were noted (P =.0001 and.005, respectively). In the IIH group, total blood flow was 46% higher than that in the control group (P =.0002), and SSS flow was normal. In the SIH group, total blood flow was normal; however, SSS flow was reduced by 25% (P =.003). CONCLUSION: Reduced venous sinus pulsatility is a marker of intracranial hypertension secondary to raised venous sinus pressure. When suspicion of IIH or SIH exists and the MR venogram is difficult to interpret, raised total blood flow indicates IIH, whereas reduced SSS flow indicates SIH.
