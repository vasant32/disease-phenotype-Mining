In a 7-year-old child, pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) developed 18 days after undergoing open-heart surgery for repair of an atrial septal defect. Pseudotumor cerebri is rare in children. Previous reports have shown that alteration of the venous drainage from the cranium can precede development of pseudotumor cerebri. To my knowledge this is the first reported case of pseudotumor cerebri in a child after open-heart surgery.
