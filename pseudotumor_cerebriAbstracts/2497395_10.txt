Intracranial pressure (ICP) was recorded by epidural transducer and cisterna magna catheter, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the intraarterial Xenon 133-technique were measured in baboons with normal and during increased ICP provoked by an inflatable balloon positioned subdurally. Arterial blood pressure was altered by controlled infusion of Sodium-nitroprusside (SNP), Nitroglycerine (NG) or Trimetaphan (TMP) with the aim of reducing blood pressure by about 20%. During exflated balloon SNP provoked an increase of ICP which was more prominent than with NG and TMP. During increased ICP (due to inflation of the balloon) again SNP led to a higher further increase of ICP than both NG and TMP. rCBF rose during the state of normal ICP when SNP was infused. This was not observed with infusion of NG or TMP. When ICP was increased again by inflation of the balloon all 3 substances reduced rCBF, indicating damage to the autoregulation. CO2-reactivity as measured by induced hyperventilation with reduction of arterial CO2-tension was affected by all 3 substances thus indicating impairment of vasoconstriction during increase of ICP and simultaneous decrease of blood pressure. However, this impairment of physiological vasoconstriction was more prominent with SNP than with NG and TMP. The results indicate that all 3 substances should be used with care to reduce blood pressure during surgery or under intensive care condition, particularly in patients with increased ICP.
