A 42-year-old woman presented with a history of headache. Results of funduscopic examination revealed elevated disc margins and bilateral optic nerve head drusen. Lumbar puncture, head computed tomography, and fluorescein fundus angiography results were consistent with the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri and coexistent disc drusen. Visual loss was demonstrated by formal perimetry. Headaches were unresponsive to a medical regimen that included prednisone, glycerol, acetazolamide, furosemide, and repeated lumbar punctures. A lumbar peritoneal shunt was performed, with immediate resolution of headache. Optic disc drusen can be associated with pseudotumor cerebri and can lead to diagnostic confusion.
