Five patients had unilateral tinnitus from increased intracranial pressure of different etiologies. In each case, the tinnitus was produced by a venous bruit and could be decreased by Valsalva's maneuver, head turning to the ipsilateral side, or by light pressure over the ipsilateral jugular vein. Correction of the increased intracranial pressure obliterated the tinnitus. Turbulence, created as blood flows from the hypertensive intracranial portion into the low pressure of the jugular bulb, is proposed as the mechanism producing the tinnitus.
