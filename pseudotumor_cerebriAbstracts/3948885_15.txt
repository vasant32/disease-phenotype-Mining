The present documentation of 23 female patients with pseudotumour cerebri seen in Benghazi, North-Eastern Libya, over a period of 2 years constituted 21 cases with idiopathic pseudotumour and 2 patients with associated endocrine diseases. The clinical, laboratory and CT scan findings indicated idiopathic hypoparathyroidism in 1 case. The association of pseudotumour and hypothyroidism in a 40-year-old woman is suggested to be more than coincidental. The patient group was significantly more obese. Moderate to severe visual loss occurred in 9 patients. The incidence and extent of visual impairment did not correlate with the duration of symptoms, degree of obesity, use of contraceptive pills, steroid treatment, the presence of systemic hypertension, menstrual irregularity or empty sella. The incidence of 1.7 per 100,000 for the total and 3.6 per 100,000 for the female population in Benghazi observed in the present study is believed to be more than the frequency (as assessed by the hospital incidence) reported from other regions. A high prevalence of obesity may partly explain the increased occurrence of pseudotumour cerebri in North-Eastern Libya.
