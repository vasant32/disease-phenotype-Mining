Benign intracranial hypertension (idiopathic hypertension, pseudomotor cerebrii) describes the syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of a focal lesion. Unlike conditions where intracranial pressure is raised due to a space-occupying lesion, dural puncture is not contraindicated. In this report we describe the delivery by caesarean section of a parturient with this rare condition using the needle through needle combined spinal-epidural technique.
