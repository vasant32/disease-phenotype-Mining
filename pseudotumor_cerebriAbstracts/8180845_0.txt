The effects of a severe head injury are immediate and have been the subject of research for decades. Heightened awareness of proposed metabolic changes and new treatments are guiding current management. The metabolic derangements that occur at the time of injury and continue through the acute phase are discussed as well as proposed treatments. In addition, advances in hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory management, and general aspects of nursing care are presented.
