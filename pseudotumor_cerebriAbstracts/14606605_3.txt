We report the extracranial venous ultrasound findings in a case of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) following unilateral radical neck dissection (rND). PTC is known to be a rare complication following bilateral rND, and is caused by venous outflow obstruction. Single cases of PTC have been reported after unilateral rND, and are thought to be due to resection of the dominant internal jugular vein (IJV) in the presence of a hypoplastic or aplastic contralateral transverse sinus. Our patient developed PTC despite prominent flow in the contralateral IJV as shown by venous ultrasound. No compensatory increase in flow in the vertebral veins was observed, as confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. We conclude that the physiological collateral function of the vertebral venous system and deep neck veins was insufficient and contributed to global venous outflow obstruction in our case of unilateral rND.
