15 consecutive patients with non-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea were studied. 13 operations were performed on 10 patients. In 8 transcranial operations, an assumed defect in the anterior fossa was plugged with muscle, but only 3 operations were successful. In 4 operations, either transcranial or transsphenoidal, the sella was packed with muscle and rhinorrhea ceased immediately. Based on radiological and operative findings, 3 groups of patients appeared (1) 9 patients had pathology related to the pituitary gland or the sella turcica: enlarged sella, empty sella, pituitary tumour, intrasellar cyst or erosion of the sellar osseous border. (2) 2 patients had rhinorrhea from extrasellar origin. (3) In 4 patients no abnormality could be found. Prior to the rhinorrhea, 6 patients (5 from group 1 and 1 from group 3) had experienced episodes of neurological symptoms, compatible with a pituitary apoplexy. It is suggested that non-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea in most cases is the result of a spontaneous necrosis in a pituitary adenoma, which has caused sellar bony erosion.
