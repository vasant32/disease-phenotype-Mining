The present investigation was made in rabbits and cats with perfusing mock cerebrospinal fluid into fourth ventriculus to produce experimental diffusion intracranial hypertension. Under normoxia and acute hypoxia conditions, the changes in cerebral blood flow, spontaneous electrocortical activity, direct cortical response, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were measured as intracranial hypertension caused by step elevation and abrupt elevation; at the same time, the relationship mentioned above was also investigated. The experimental results are very important to clinic treatment and to the patients suffering from anoxia with intracranial hypertension.
