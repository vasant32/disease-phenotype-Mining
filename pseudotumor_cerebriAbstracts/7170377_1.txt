We present an electroclinical study of 4 severe pneumococcal meningitis cases with intracranial hypertension. In addition to classical anticerebral edema therapy thiopental infusion was used. The plasma thiopental level seems to be only an incomplete indicator of cerebral drug effect, but must be measured to avoid accumulation. EEG monitoring appears to be better in evaluating the clinical status and barbituric impregnation. The burst suppression in EEG recording is noted at variable periods (9-48 h) after the start of the treatment and disappears on discontinuation of infusion while the plasma drug levels remain high. Further, in two cases EEG changes preceded clinical deficits. Evolution of clinical and EEG status was good in the 4 children.
