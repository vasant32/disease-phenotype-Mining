Pseudotumor cerebri is a syndrome characterized by intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O) and a normal ventricular system. The diagnosis should be made as early as possible to prevent impairment of vision. Several diseases have been reported in association with pseudotumor cerebri in pediatric patients, and have been occasionally also noted with chronic renal failure, heart and renal transplantation. We report a 7-year-old boy who complained of severe headaches and visual impairment 2 years after hemodialysis for renal hypoplasia. Pseudotumor cerebri was suspected and, despite treatment with corticosteroids, acetazolamide, and lumboperitoneal diversion, visual impairment worsened. Bilateral optic nerve sheath decompression (ONSD) was performed without success and the child completely lost his vision within 2 weeks. He was successfully transplanted 2 months later. Two years post transplantation, the blind child has a normal renal function and school performance. Pseudotumor cerebri must be rapidly suspected in a child with renal failure suffering from headaches and papilledema. Visual loss may progress rapidly and ONSD seems to be the best surgical treatment when medical treatment fails. In this patient renal transplantation was well tolerated, with no deterioration in the neurological status over 2 years of follow-up.
