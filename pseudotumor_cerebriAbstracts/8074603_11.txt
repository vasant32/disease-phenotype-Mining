Minocycline is a tetracycline agent frequently used for acne therapy. It has a few rare but severe side effects that are not widely known but should be recognized early as drug related. These include acute hepatitis and liver failure; a LÃ¶ffler-like syndrome with pulmonary infiltrates, wheezing, fever, and eosinophilia; skin eruptions, eosinophilic cellulitis, and pustular folliculitis with eosinophilia; and a lupuslike syndrome. Side effects that are better known and recognized include photosensitization, skin exanthema with pruritus, and pseudotumor cerebri.
