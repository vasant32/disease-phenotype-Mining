Cerebrospinal dynamics has been investigated by statistical analysis of results of computerised monitoring of 80 head injured patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Pinderfields General Hospital. One minute average values of intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial pressure (ABP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), amplitude of the fundamental component of the intracranial pressure pulse wave and the short-term moving correlation coefficient between that amplitude and mean ICP (RAP) were recorded. It was found that reduction of CPP down to 40 mmHg was more often caused by decrease in ABP than increase in ICP. Further falls in CPP below 40 mmHg were caused by substantial increases in ICP above 25 mmHg. The relationship between the ICP pulse wave amplitude and CPP showed a significant gradual increase in amplitude with CPP decreasing from 75 to 30 mmHg. For CPP below 30 mmHg there is a sharp decrease in amplitude followed by a change in the coefficient RAP from positive to negative values. This was interpreted as a sign of critical disturbance in cerebral circulation.
