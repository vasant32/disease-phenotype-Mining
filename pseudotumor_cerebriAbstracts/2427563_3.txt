A 39 year old woman presented a sudden loss of vision in her right eye due to a sero-hemorrhagic retinal detachment associated to bilateral papilledema. A bilateral juxtapapillary subretinal neovascularization was observed on fluorescein angiography. Neurologic examination was normal except for intracranial pressure that was 22 mmHg. Lowering of the intracranial pressure with acetazolamide and prednisone resulted in a rapid improvement of visual acuity, with resorption of the hemorrhages and involution of the subretinal membranes.
