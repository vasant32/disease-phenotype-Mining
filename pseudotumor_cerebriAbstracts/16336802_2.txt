INTRODUCTION: We report here a case of a patient with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) associated with morbid obesity. PTC, also called benign intracranial hypertension, is a known complication of morbid obesity with resolution by reduction of obesity. CLINICAL CASE: A 42-year-old female with morbid obesity and secondary PTC underwent a modified jejunocolonostomy. RESULTS: The patient has lost 43% of excess body weight and the intracranial pressure is normal. CONCLUSIONS: PTC is a benign pathology, and the cause may be morbid obesity. Bariatric surgery is useful in the management of these patients for the resolution of this disease.
