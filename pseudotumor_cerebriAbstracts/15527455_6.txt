OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the association between tetracycline treatment and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). METHODS: Consecutive patients from two neuro-ophthalmic referral centers, who developed PTC syndrome post-treatment with tetracycline, were enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 years after cessation of tetracycline. RESULTS: A total of 243 consecutive patients were diagnosed with PTC; 18 had concurrent history of tetracycline treatment; a third experienced a limited course of illness with no relapses; 12 had a variable course with a prolonged relapsing illness. Mean duration of tetracycline treatment prior to diagnosis was 2.73 months. CONCLUSIONS: Tetracycline, and especially minocycline, is currently considered a cause or a precipitating factor for PTC. Although there is little information on the natural course of tetracycline induced PTC, the present cases demonstrate that drug withdrawal is curative only in some patients.
