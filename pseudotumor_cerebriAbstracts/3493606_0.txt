The authors studied 100 patients with rhinosinusogenic cerebral arachnoiditis who were treated in a neurosurgical clinic. Seventy-eight patients presented optochiasmal arachnoiditis: 12 had trigeminal neuralgia; 1, arachnoiditis of the cerebellopontile angle; 6, arachnoiditis of the convex surface of the brain; and 3, the hypertensive hydrocephalic syndrome due to occlusion of the CSF routes. The authors emphasize the necessity of X-ray examination of the nasal sinuses in all patients when an inflammatory intracranial process is suspected. The treatment of rhinosinusogenic cerebral arachnoiditis consisted of the sanitation of the nasal sinuses and the performance of different neurosurgical operations for arachnoiditis complications. The patients also received antiinflammatory, dehydration, detoxication, and resorptive therapy. Such combined treatment resulted in regression of neurological symptoms in 82 patients.
