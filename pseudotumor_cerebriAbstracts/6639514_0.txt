Benign intracranial hypertension is caused by defective cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption which may sometimes be secondary to partial superior sagittal sinus obstruction. It may appear in obese young women for obscure hormonal reasons or may be a reaction to head injury, infections or certain medications. It commonly presents with headache and papilloedema, sometimes with associated ocular palsies. Conservative management comprises repeated lumbar puncture, salt and fluid restriction and the use of diuretics or steroids. Surgical treatment such as CSF shunting procedures, optic nerve decompression or subtemporal decompression may become necessary. The results of treatment have not been subjected to adequate evaluation, but the patient usually recovers well, although some 10% suffer severe visual impairment and 10% are subject to recurrence.
