The authors investigated 17 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), correlating laser scanning tomography of the optic nerve with CSF opening pressure. The decrease in papilla volume and papilla height showed a linear correlation with the opening pressure of the CSF (r = 0.59, p < 0.001; r = 0.63, p < 0.001). If the CSF opening pressure is higher than 20 cm water, an increase of 5 cm water CSF pressure corresponds to a papilla volume increase of 0.95 mm3 as well as a papilla height increase of 0.34 mm.
