OBJECTIVE: Lumboperitoneal shunting is the bastion of neurosurgical management for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, recent studies document a high failure rate for this procedure. The present study was designed to explore the feasibility of placing ventriculoperitoneal shunts under stereotactic control into patients with IIH as an alternative to lumboperitoneal shunting. METHODS: Seven patients with IIH for whom medical management had failed underwent stereotactic implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts. RESULTS: Shunt placement was successful and uncomplicated in each case. Five of seven patients experienced complete resolution of papilledema. The remaining two patients showed resolving papilledema. Six of seven patients experienced resolution of headache. The remaining patient continued to have headaches despite a radionuclide study demonstrating normal shunt function. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that stereotactic ventriculoperitoneal shunting may be a reasonable alternative to lumboperitoneal shunting in those patients with IIH who require surgical intervention.
