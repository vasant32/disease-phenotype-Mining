Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare syndrome characterised by prolonged elevation of intracranial pressure in the absence of hydrocephalus, intracranial mass lesion or infection, and with increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure but a normal composition. We report a case of uncontrolled idiopathic intracranial hypertension successfully managed using an intrathecal catheter for analgesia in labour and delivery as well as temporary control of intracranial pressure.
