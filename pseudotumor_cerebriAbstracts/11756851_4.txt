OBJECTIVES: To determine if confocal scanning laser (CSL) tomography can quantify optic disc topography in patients with pseudopapilledema (PP) and to contrast the regional topography of the optic disc in PP and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional optic disc images from 10 PP patients PP and 17 PTC patients were obtained using the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT). Two conventional HRT parameters, volume above the reference plane and volume above the surface, were used to quantify global disc elevation. In addition, local topography was determined at 100 microm intervals along eight meridians at 100 to 1700 microm from the disc center. The global and local measures of disc topography in the two groups were compared statistically. RESULTS: Significant between group differences were detected for both global measures. Regional analysis revealed vertical symmetry and horizontal asymmetry in PP and PTC as well as significant between group differences in peripapillary height. CONCLUSIONS: CSL tomography can quantify disc elevation in both PP and PTC and may be useful for differentiating disc morphology in PP and PTC. The volume of the disc above the retinal surface is greater in PTC than in PP. However, most of the difference in elevation between the two groups occurs over the disc rim and peripapillary retina.
