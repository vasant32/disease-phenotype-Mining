We report magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT) and angiographic imaging of an unusual giant arachnoid granulation 7(GAG) in the superior sagittal sinus in a man with headache and vertigo. Intrasinus pressure measurements revealed a significant pressure gradient across the lesion. MR imaging is useful to identify GAG and dural sinus thrombosis, whereas dural sinus pressure measurement in certain cases of GAGs can be used to evaluate the lesion as the cause of the patient's symptoms.
