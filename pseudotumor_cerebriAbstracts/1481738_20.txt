Resistance to cerebro-spinal fluid outflow is together with intracranial pressure the most important parameter in the investigation of patients with disturbances of CSF dynamics. The methods for determination of resistance are either unreliable or too time-consuming for routine clinical use, which has limited the popularity of this kind of measurement. In this paper a method for computerized acquisition and processing of an infusion test is described. A good correlation to a standard technique is documented.
