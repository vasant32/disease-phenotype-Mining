The authors report 33 observations concerning benign intracranial hypertension in 4 months to 15 year-old children. They emphasize the prevalence of this syndrome and the frequent absence of papilloedema at this age period. CCT scan is the neuroradiologic procedure of choice to exclude an intracranial lesion. It is important to note the exceptional evolution to a secondary optic atrophy.
