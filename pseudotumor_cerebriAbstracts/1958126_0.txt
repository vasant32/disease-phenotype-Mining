Pituitary function studies were performed on 20 patients with benign intracranial hypertension. Abnormal results were only obtained in six cases and all of these findings could be attributed to sources other than the increased intracranial pressure. Once the disease as well as its cause had disappeared, a second study was carried out and the results for all the patients were then normal. Computerized tomographic scanning of the sella turcica detected an empty sella in one patient and a possible hypophyseal microadenoma without functional repercussions in another. No evidence was found that benign intracranial hypertension is provoked by an impairment in pituitary function, nor that it could be a secondary complication thereof.
