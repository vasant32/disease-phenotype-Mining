The association of intracranial hypertension and arteriovenous malformations is described in two patients. Both patients had the typical clinical features of pseudotumour cerebri and were found to have intracranial arteriovenous malformations on arteriography. The mechanism of raised intracranial pressure in patients with arteriovenous malformations is discussed.
