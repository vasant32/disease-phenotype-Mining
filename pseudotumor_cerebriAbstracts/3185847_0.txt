The authors present the results of the postoperative I.C.P. records in 35 patients. The results emphasize the relationship between the clinical grading and the degree of the intracranial pressure: 4/7 grades III (Hunt and Hess grading) and all the grades IV (4/4) had an abnormal intracranial pressure. The location of the aneurysm does not clearly appear as a significant factor of increased intracranial pressure in the postoperative period.
