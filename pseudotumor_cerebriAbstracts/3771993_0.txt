This paper reports the case of a 27-year-old obese female who presented for routine eye examination with bilateral disc edema. A preliminary diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was confirmed following neurologic examination. Causative mechanisms and treatment alternatives of this syndrome, as well as differential diagnosis of the swollen disc, will be discussed.
