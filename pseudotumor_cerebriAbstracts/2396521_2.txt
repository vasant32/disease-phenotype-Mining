Long-term neuropsychological recovery of 24 severe head-injured patients was examined and correlated with acute measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP) and diffuse computed tomographic (CT) lesions. Intracranial hypertension (ICP greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg) was present acutely in 12 patients and absent in 12 patients. CT diagnoses of diffuse swelling (DS) was present in 12 patients, and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in 12 patients. During chronic recovery, neuropsychological dysfunctioning was found in all cases. Patients with acute ICP elevations showed more intellectual and memory losses than those without acute ICP elevations. No neuropsychological differences were found between patients with DS and DAI injuries. The findings suggest secondary brain insults caused by intracranial hypertension may be more disruptive to long-term neuropsychological functioning than diffuse lesion type.
