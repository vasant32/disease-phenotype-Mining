Three cases of abdominal complications of ventriculo-peritoneal shunts are reported. Abdominal pseudocysts were identified in 2 patients (surinfection was proven in one of them). Malposition of the shunt was demonstrated for the third patient. Ultrasound was the most helpful imaging technique for the detection of these abdominal complications. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the sonographic findings before the patients were reoperated.
