Lumbo-peritoneal shunt as one of the modalities for management of benign intracranial hypertension is prone to complications. We are reporting a rare complication of lumbo-peritoneal shunt insertion in which our patient had developed a painful swelling on the scar site. Surgical exploration confirmed diagnosis of abdominal wall endometriosis. Abdominal wall swelling with variation in size and tenderness during menstrual cycle in female patients with shunt, especially lumbo-peritoneal shunt, should raise the suspicion of endometriosis.
