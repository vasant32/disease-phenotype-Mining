OBJECT: Continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring using an epidural sensor is a common technique used in selected neurosurgical patients. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and accuracy of the Neurodur-P epidural sensor in the clinical setting. METHODS: The zero drift, as well as the medical and technical complications, of using the Neurodur-P sensor placed in the epidural space was evaluated in 106 patients with hydrocephalus of varying causes or with suspected intracranial hypertension. RESULTS: The median duration of ICP monitoring was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-12 days). In 78 (73.6%) of the 106 patients the pressure reading was recorded at sensor removal. No zero drift was observed in 28 sensors. The median drift was 0 mm Hg with an IQR of -1 to 1 mm Hg. No significant differences were found between patients monitored for < or = 5 days and those monitored for > 5 days (t = 535, p = 0.100). No correlation was found between zero drift and monitoring time (r = 0.153, p = 0.181). Of the 83 patients with a follow-up computed tomography scan, 3 showed a < 1 ml collection of blood at the catheter tip. No clinical infections could be attributed to the devices. Only 1 sensor malfunctioned. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous ICP monitoring using the Neurodur-P sensor is safe, reliable, and easy to perform. At present, using this device is the authors' standard method for the long-term monitoring of patients with alterations in complex cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or with implanted shunts.
