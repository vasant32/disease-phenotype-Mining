This study sought to characterize the optic disc morphology, particularly the cup-to-disc ratio of the optic nerve head in children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The medical charts and digital optic disc photos of children with confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were reviewed retrospectively. The optic disc area, cup area, and cup-to-disc ratio were measured digitally using VISUPAC software, and the mean values of those parameters were compared to the published norms. Of children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, 83% had absence of the physiological cup of the optic disc, compared to 10% of children in the general population of the same age. The median disc area was 2.2 mm(2), and median cup area was 0.0mm(2), compared to the published norms of 2.69 mm(2) and 0.44 mm(2), respectively. There is very significantly high prevalence of small optic disc cups in children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, with the cup being absent on majority of cases in our patient cohort. This may signal an underlying systemic predisposition to the development of intracranial hypertension.
