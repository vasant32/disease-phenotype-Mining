Traumatic intracranial hematomas which are present on hospital admission or which develop during the hospital course are associated with a worse neurological outcome than diffuse injuries. The purpose of this study was to monitor jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjvo2) during surgery for evacuation of traumatic intracranial mass lesions, to determine the incidence and the causes of jugular venous desaturation, and to assess the usefulness of Sjvo2 monitoring in this setting. Twenty-five severely head injured patients were monitored during 27 surgical procedures. At the start of the surgical procedure, the median Sjvo2 was 47% (range 25%-89%). Seventeen (63%) of the patients had a Sjvo2 less than 50%. Five patients had extremely low Sjvo2 values (< or = 30%). Upon evacuation of the intracranial hematoma, there was a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the median Sjvo2 to 65% (range 50%-88%). Intracranial hypertension was the primary cause of the low Sjvo2, as confirmed by the response to surgical evacuation. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 80 mm Hg) was a contributing factor in seven of the cases of jugular desaturation. The definitive treatment of a traumatic intracranial hematoma is surgical evacuation. However, during the period prior to evacuation of the hematoma, jugular venous desaturation was common, suggesting that monitoring Sjvo2 might provide useful information about the adequacy of cerebral perfusion.
