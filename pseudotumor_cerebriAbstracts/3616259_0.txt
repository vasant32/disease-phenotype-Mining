The effects and indications of barbiturate therapy for brain protection, and prevention and reduction of the intracranial hypertension were investigated using an ultrashort acting barbiturate, thiamylal, in sixteen cases with intracranial lesions. Final outcome of the treatment revealed 8 good recoveries which were actively administered thiamylal during operation or immediately after. On the other hand, four cases, whose intracranial pressures (ICPS) of over 40 mmHg could not be controlled suffered brain death. Barbiturate therapy was not effective for brain protection of primary damaged lesions. It is concluded that barbiturate therapy may provide a satisfactory reduction of the intracranial hypertension in cases during the early postoperative stage or of under 40 mmHg initial ICP.
