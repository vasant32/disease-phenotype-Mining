For the treatment of postoperative seizures and prevention of brain edema, an etomidate drip was used in conjunction with phenytoin, diazepam, pentobarbital, and phenobarbital in a 70-year-old woman. During a period of 24 hours, the patient received in excess of 479 g of propylene glycol, which was present at 35% (vol/vol) concentration in the undiluted etomidate. The propylene glycol toxic reaction resolved after the infusion was stopped.
