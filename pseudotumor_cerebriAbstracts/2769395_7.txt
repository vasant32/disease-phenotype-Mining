Two young Arab women presented with a very rapid loss of vision, ophthalmoplegia, florid papilledema, areflexia of the lower limbs, and normal mentation. Lumbar puncture pressure was above 60 cm H2O, but no intracranial structural lesion was found in either patient. An exhaustive evaluation as to an etiology was negative in both. Under continuous lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage and administration of steroids, furosemide, and acetazolamide, both patients had significantly improved vision and ocular movement. In both, lumboperitoneal shunting was considered but only one eventually underwent this procedure. These two patients with pseudotumor cerebri are unique in their fulminant clinical course and severely increased intracranial pressure. Virtually inevitable blindness was prevented by timely intervention.
