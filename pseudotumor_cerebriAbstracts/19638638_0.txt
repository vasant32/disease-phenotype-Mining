To evaluate the usefulness of neuroimaging in children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and age-matched controls were reviewed. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension had flattening of the posterior sclera in 61% versus 40% of cases, distension of perioptic subarachnoid space in 65% versus 35%, intraocular protrusion of pre-laminar optic nerve in 17% versus 0%, tortuosity of optic nerve in 30% versus 5%, and an empty sella in 26% versus 5% of cases. The presence of 3 or more of the MRI features is 95% specific in predicting idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The observed general anesthetic effect on these neuroimaging features are also minimized when multiple features are taken into account. Magnetic resonance imaging features can assist in suspecting the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children, provided caution is applied when interpreting imaging performed under a general anesthesia.
