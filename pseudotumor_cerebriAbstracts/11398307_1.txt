A 21-year-old developed progressive headaches and pulsatile tinnitus. He was found to have papilledema and a pulsatile bruit. A dural arteriovenous malformation was not recognized on brain CT or MRI, but was well documented on magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography. Dural malformations draining into the superior sagittal sinus can cause increased intracranial venous pressure and secondarily increase intracranial pressure even without a mass effect.
