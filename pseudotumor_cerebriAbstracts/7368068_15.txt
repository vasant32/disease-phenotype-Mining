The present paper reports a case of intracranial hypertension secondary to thrombophlebitis of the two transverse sinuses and internal jugular veins in which microsurgical revascularization was attempted. This was carried out by means of a bypass graft inserted between the right transverse sinus and the superficial jugular vein. As early as the first post-operative week, intracranial pressure improved and visual disorders regressed. This type of venous revascularization using microsurgical techniques should contribute to more successful and lasting results in cases of sinus occlusions of thrombophlebitic, traumatic or tumorous origins.
