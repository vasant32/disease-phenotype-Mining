Cerebral tuberculous abscess is exceptional. We report on the case of a H.I.V. positive 29 year-old man suffering from high intracranial pressure together with a cerebellar syndrome. The CT scan revealed a voluminous abscess of the left cerebellar hemisphere. Anatomical and pathological examination of the extracted mass showed a tuberculous abscess. 16 months after surgery and antituberculous treatment, the patient's symptoms have disappeared and he has resumed his professional activities. Though controversial, a pathogenic continuum between a tuberculoma and a tuberculous abscess may be assumed to exist. The A.I.D.S. pandemic reactivates the tuberculous foci, increases the risks of contagion reduced the effectiveness of treatment, and justifies a systematic search for the bacillus of Koch, after puncture, in any cerebral abscess.
