Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a condition of increased intracranial pressure without the presence of mass lesions and with normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. Patients may experience papilledema and vision loss. Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) is one method of stabilizing visual function and decreasing optic nerve edema. The authors report on 10 patients who underwent bilateral ONSF and in whom visual function was stable or improved postoperatively. The results obtained in these cases suggest that ONSF plays a role in visual preservation in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients in the acute setting.
