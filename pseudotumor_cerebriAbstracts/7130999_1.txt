The concentration of oestrone in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from obese young women with pseudotumour cerebri was much greater than predicted and found in normal subjects. Each woman with pseudotumour cerebri, and a high level of CSF oestrone and a CSF protein less than 0Â·2 g/l, had clinical improvement when treated with an 800 calorie/day diet and dexamethasone 2 mg/day.
