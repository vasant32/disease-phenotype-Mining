We report a 16-year-old morbidly obese African-American female who developed pseudotumor cerebri, partially empty sella syndrome and transient central hypothyroidism. After reduction of the increased intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture, normalization of the thyroid function occurred. The mechanism of the transient pituitary dysfunction in relation to the pseudotumor cerebri and empty sella is discussed.
