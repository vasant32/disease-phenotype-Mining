A 17-year-old Caucasian female patient, who had been prescribed minocycline for acne vulgaris, presented with postural visual obscurations. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed papilloedema in each eye. Neuro-imaging of the brain and orbits was normal. A diagnosis of minocycline induced benign intracranial hypertension was made. Withdrawal of minocycline led to resolution of her symptoms and the papilloedema.
