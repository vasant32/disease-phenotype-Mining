Parasagittal meningiomas often invade the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), but rarely grow inside the SSS as a primary tumor. The authors report a case of parasagittal meningioma growing mainly inside the SSS and presenting papilledema. The SSS is invisible behind the tumor end on the right carotid angiogram but still patent on the left carotid angiogram. The superficial cortical vein on the opposite side works as a collateral pathway. The tumor may have originated from the right wall of the SSS, grew inside the sinus and covered the entrances of the right ascending cerebral veins. V-P shunt was performed after removal of the mass outside the sinus for resolving headache and visual symptoms.
