A 38-year-old obese woman with concurrent hypothyroidism and pseudotumor cerebri was monitored with serial thyroid function tests and CSF pressure determinations during levothyroxine sodium replacement therapy. Following normalization of the patient's thyroid status, assessed by both clinical and chemical indexes (serum thyroxine level, 1.5 to 11.0 micrograms/dL; serum thyrotropin level, 128 to 1.5 micro units/mL), intracranial hypertension persisted for more than four months. After weight loss, acetazolamide therapy, and intermittent CSF drainage failed to produce remission, glucocorticoid therapy was associated with prompt, sustained resolution of the pseudotumor cerebri. Contrary to previous reports, this patient's clinical course suggests that thyroid hormone deficiency and pseudotumor cerebri are not causally related.
