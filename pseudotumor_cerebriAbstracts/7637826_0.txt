Increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure of usually unknown etiology is called pseudotumor cerebri. The key symptoms are headache, papilledema and fluctuating visual disturbances. Six cases are presented to illustrate the clinical variability of this syndrome. Headache or papilledema may be missing in individual cases. The clinical diagnosis can be facilitated by the recognition of accessory signs and symptoms, such as VIth nerve palsy, tinnitus and other cranial nerve disorders or neck stiffness. For the therapeutic outcome it is essential to detect and monitor visual disturbances early in the course of the disease.
