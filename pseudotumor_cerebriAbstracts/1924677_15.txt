Several centres that perform liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure have experience of patients who have not regained consciousness despite adequate graft function. In some of these, decerebration because of elevation in intracranial pressure was thought to have occurred intraoperatively or in the early post-operative period. In the present study six patients with fulminant hepatic failure who were transplanted had extradural monitors inserted before operation. Intracranial pressure had been controlled prior to transplantation and rose during the pre-clamp phase of the operation. Levels fell during the anhepatic phase but rose again during the reperfusion phase (p = 0.033). Overall, from the induction of anaesthesia to the reperfusion phase there was a significant increase in mean intracranial pressure (p less than 0.01). The cerebral perfusion pressure fell after induction of anaesthesia from a median 54 mmHg (range 46-62) to a median 35 mmHg (range 19-49, p less than 0.001) in the pre-clamp phase and remained low throughout the operation. During the first 10 hours after transplantation, three patients had further episodes of intracranial hypertension requiring treatment and it is important that monitoring should be continued through this period.
