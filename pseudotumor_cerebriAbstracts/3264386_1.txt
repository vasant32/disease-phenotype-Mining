Cysticercosis cerebri is a rare neurological diagnosis in France. It is classically divided into four types: intraparenchymal, basilar cisternal, ventricular and diffuse. Three cases of intraventricular cysticercosis are reported. All patients had symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus and the authors emphasize the necessity of investigating for possible neurocysticercosis patients from endemics areas who presented such a clinical picture. They emphasize the interest of the E.L.I.S.A. test in order to detect anticysticercosis antibodies in blood and C.S.F. and the interest of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in order to visualise the cysts. Praziquantel do not affect intraventricular cysts and the surgical treatment is necessary to remove the cysts because the presence of an intraventricular parasite indicates an important risk of acute hydrocephalus and secondary of ependymitis source of irreversible neurological damages.
