The epidural balloon compression model in the cat was used in intracranial volume reserve studies. The evaluation of the intracranial volume-pressure relations was based on the lumbar infusion test data: intracranial pressure, CSF outflow resistance, volume-pressure response and on CT images numerical analysis (CTINA) values. Two methods were applied and compared in the study: lumbar infusion test and CT images numerical analysis. The determinations were performed at the balloon volumes of 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 1.5 ml. First statistically significant changes were found at the balloon volume of 0.5 ml i.e. the increase of CSF outflow resistance and volume-pressure response (data obtained in lumbar infusion test) and the decrease in CTINA values. The rise of intracranial pressure was less informative as it was observed at the balloon volume of 1.5 ml. Therefore CTINA seems to be a very useful noninvasive screening method in clinical studies of intracranial volume reserve.
