A 16-year-old girl treated with isotretinoin at a dosage of 0.7 mg per kg each day experienced severe headaches and impaired night vision two months after the start of therapy. Bilateral papilledema and narrowing of the lateral ventricles of the brain were found. Pseudotumor cerebri and impaired night vision abated when isotretinoin was discontinued and systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone) were administered.
