Data from 14 patients with benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) have been analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares regression model which was developed and programmed from in-hospital microcomputer use. The method of analysis permits rapid estimation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation and absorption rates as functions of pressure in individual patients using data from constant-rate infusion manometrics. The analysis predicts that prednisone therapy in pseudotumor cerebri reduces resting CSF pressure by increasing CSF absorption at all intracranial pressures studied, and decreasing CSF formation at high pressures. This result is in accordance with evidence suggesting that impaired CSF absorption plays a major role in the pathogenesis of increased intracranial pressure in pseudotumor cerebri.
