A new technique is described that utilises a novel magnetic resonance pulse sequence to produce a quantitative index both for ventricular and, for the first time, extraventricular intracranial CSF volumes. The pulse sequence is a combination of a null-point inversion recovery sequence with an extended spin-echo read (echo time = 400 ms), which produces a contrast of CSF to white or grey matter of approximately 120:1. A series of experiments are performed on phantoms representing CSF filled ventricles and sulci over a wide range of volume values, and it is found that the standard deviation of differences between true and estimated values is 3.9% for ventricles, 4.6% for total cranial CSF, and 7.9% for CSF within the sulci. Normal volunteer reproducibility studies revealed corresponding standard deviations of less than 5.5%. Using the technique to produce absolute estimates of CSF volumes in normal subjects and patients produced results in good agreement with previously published necropsy studies. The technique has wide neurological and neurosurgical applicability particularly in terms of differential diagnosis and as an objective monitor of therapy or progression in conditions such as hydrocephalus, atrophy, and benign intracranial hypertension.
