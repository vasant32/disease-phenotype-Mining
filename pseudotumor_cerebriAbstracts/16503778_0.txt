A case is presented in which a woman diagnosed with a longstanding history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension reported improvement of frontal headaches, photophobia, transient blindness, enlarged blind spots, and tinnitus after smoking marijuana. All these symptoms and signs were associated with increased intracranial pressure (220-425 mm of water). Treatment with dronabinol at a dose of 10 mg twice a day, then reduced to 5 mg twice a day, relieved all of her symptoms. Previously noted papilledema and enlargement of blind spots also resolved, and this, in the absence of psychoactive effect or weight gain.
