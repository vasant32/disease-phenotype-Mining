The effects of succinylcholine (1.5 mg X kg-1 IV) administered five minutes after a defasciculating dose of curare (0.05 mg X kg-1 IV), were compared with the effects of atracurium (0.5 mg X kg-1 IV) on intracranial pressure (ICP) in 13 cynomolgus monkeys with intracranial hypertension (ICP approximately 25 mmHg). Neither succinylcholine nor atracurium increased ICP during general anaesthesia with 60 per cent N2O/O2, 0.5-1 per cent halothane. During a rapid sequence induction and intubation with thiopentone 5 mg X kg-1 IV, ICP increased equally with intubation following both atracurium (25 +/- 1 to 32 +/- 2 mmHg) and succinylcholine (25 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 2 mmHg) (p less than 0.05). Intubation was also associated with significant increases in PaCO2, CVP and MAP. We conclude that in this primate model of intracranial hypertension, neither atracurium nor succinylcholine (when given following a defasciculating dose of curare) elevates ICP. In terms of the elevation of ICP associated with intubation, atracurium was found to offer no advantage over succinylcholine.
