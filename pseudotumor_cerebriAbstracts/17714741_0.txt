INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system with a variety of clinical and radiological presentations. Several cases have been reported of demyelinating processes mimicking a tumour of the central nervous system. OBSERVATION: A 45-year-old man was admitted with acute right hemiparesis associated with intracranial hypertension syndrome. Initial CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a mass lesion in the left hemisphere. Combined, careful history taking, assessment of the clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging findings led to the final diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates the wide variety of multiple sclerosis presentation. Recognition of the demyelinating tumor like lesions is essential; the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be considered in young adults with similar presentations.
