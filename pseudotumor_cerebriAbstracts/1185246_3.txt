The effect of prolonged mannitol infusion upon intraventricular pressure was investigated with the aid of a specially-designed automatic digital recording system; the data recorded were processed off-line by a minicomputer. The character of the pressure curves is thought to result from interaction between the mannitol effect and the observed system's shifting equilibrium position, which is caused by other factors. The character of the pressure curves prior to mannitol infusion must be taken into consideration in estimating the actual effect of the drug; the authors suggest that in certain cases it might be possible to decrease further the rate of mannitol administration. The advantages of statistical approach to the evaluation of intracranial pressure variations are discussed.
