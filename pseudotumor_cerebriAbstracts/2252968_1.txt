The incidence and natural history of hypertension associated with traumatic brain injury were studied using a cohort of 80 patients discharged from a brain-injury rehabilitation centre. Although a significant incidence (15%) of hypertension is documented in traumatic brain-injured patients, the problem appears transient for most patients. Nonetheless, hypertension after brain injury merits treatment while it is an ongoing process for the anticipated few patients in whom it might persist.
