 PURPOSE: To quantify the relationship between optic nerve head tomography and perimetric sensitivity in patients with papilledema. METHODS: Eight patients with variable degrees of recently diagnosed papilledema associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were evaluated with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) and automated perimetry. Patients were followed up with serial measurements over a period of 5 to 30 months (mean +/- SD, 17.1 +/- 9), while under medical treatment (acetazolamide). The tomographic parameters, volume above reference (VAR), volume above surface (VAS), effective mean height (EMH), and maximum height in contour (MxHC), were obtained by tomography, either globally or from predefined disc sectors. The perimetric indices, mean deviation (MD) and pattern SD (PSD), were evaluated. The results from patients' right eyes and the individual intereye differences in both tomographic and perimetric parameters, were statistically evaluated by nonparametric correlational (Spearman) and repeated measures (Wilcoxon) analyses. RESULTS: At baseline, all tomographic parameters were negatively correlated with MD in global (r = -0.8) and sectorial (r = -0.6) evaluations. The interocular differences in overall tomographic parameters were correlated with corresponding differences in perimetric MD (r = -0.8) and PSD (r = 0.6). During the follow-up period, volumetric disc parameters decreased (P < 0.02), whereas perimetric MD increased (P = 0.02) at comparable times. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recently diagnosed papilledema, optic nerve head tomographic abnormalities are quantitatively correlated with visual field sensitivity losses. Therapeutic improvement of volumetric parameters may be paralleled by recovery in perimetric sensitivity. The data support the possible use of both techniques in combination to monitor the amount of papilledema and the effectiveness of treatments designed to reduce intracranial hypertension.
