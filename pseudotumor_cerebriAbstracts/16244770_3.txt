The existence of an association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and coagulation disorders in men was assessed prospectively. Microthrombi, associated with thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis, occlude arachnoid sinus villi, thus reducing resorption of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to IIH. Ten consecutively referred men with IIH, nine whites, one African American, median age 36 years, were 2 to 1 matched by age and race by healthy male controls. Polymerase chain reaction assays were done for four thrombophilic and one hypofibrinolytic gene mutations: G1691A factor V Leiden, G20210A prothrombin, C677T MTHFR, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (PL A1/A2), and 4G/5G polymorphism of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) gene promoter. Coagulation measures in plasma included dilute Russel's viper venom time (dRVVT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the lupus anticoagulant, factor VIII, factor XI, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI-Fx), protein C antigenic, protein S total (antigenic), protein S free (antigenic), antithrombin III (functional), and resistance to activated protein C (RAPC). Tests performed on serum included anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine, and Lp(a). The body mass index was 40 kg/m(2) or greater (extremely obese) in two men, 30 to 40 kg/m(2) (obese) in three, and was 25 to 30 kg/m(2) in five (overweight). Cases differed from controls for inherited 4G4G homozygosity of the PAI-1 gene, four of 10 (40%) vs. one of 20 (5%), Fisher's p [p(f)]= .031, and for high levels (>21.1 U/mL) of the hypofibrinolytic PAI-1 gene product, PAI-Fx, 5 of 10 (50%) vs. one of 18 (6%), p(f) = .013. Thrombophilic factor VIII was high (> or = 150%) in three of 10 (30%) cases vs. zero of 16 (0%) controls, p(f)=. 046. The thrombophilic lupus anticoagulant was present in two of 10 (20%) cases vs. zero of 32 (0%) controls, p(f) = .052. Heritable hypofibrinolysis and heritable and acquired thrombophilia appear, speculatively, to be treatable etiologies of IIH in men. Understanding contributions of hypofibrinolysis and thrombophilia to the development of IIH should facilitate development of novel new approaches to treat this often-disabling neurologic disorder.
