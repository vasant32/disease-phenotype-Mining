INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Massive usage of new neuroimaging techniques has produced an increase in the number of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis. Our aim has been to evaluate this shift in our county through the clinico-radiologic characteristics of the patients admitted to our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the last 7 years a total of 12 patients suffering from cerebral venous thrombosis were attended in our department. We have analyzed retrospectively their clinical records. RESULTS: There were 11 women 1 man with a range of ages from 13 to 60 years old. The main associated factor was oral contraceptives intake. Most of them presented with symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive diagnostic tool. Outcome was good in general. Most of them were treated with intravenous heparin during the acute phase and received oral anticoagulation for 6 months. More than half were diagnosed all over the last three years. CONCLUSIONS: Our data seem to confirm this tendency towards a larger number of cases with the application of new diagnostic tools. In these cases, clinical course is more benign than reported in classical series.
