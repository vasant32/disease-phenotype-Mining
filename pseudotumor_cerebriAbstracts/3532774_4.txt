Thrombosis of the right innominate vein occurred in a patient on maintenance hemodialysis following repeated subclavian vein catheterization. The patient had a functional right brachial arteriovenous fistula for blood access that resulted in a massive retrograde blood flow into the cerebral venous system with the development of the benign intracranial hypertension. The symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension abated following ligation of the arteriovenous fistula. This unusual association of benign intracranial hypertension with an arteriovenous fistula and innominate vein thrombosis has not been reported previously. Pertinent literature dealing with benign intracranial hypertension and complications of subclavian vein catheterization is reviewed.
