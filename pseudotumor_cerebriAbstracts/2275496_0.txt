Two cases of benign intracraneal hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, associated with non specific infective illness, in infants are reported. Presenting symptoms were vomiting, irritability and bulging anterior fontanelle. Both infants had rapid resolution of their symptoms after lumbar puncture, although the second case had recurrences with further febrile diseases. We suggest that a non specific infective illness can interfere transiently with cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.
