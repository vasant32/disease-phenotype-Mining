Experience so far obtained from epidural brain pressure measurement in the wake of severe craniocerebral trauma is reported in this paper. Measuring equipment according to Gobiet and Schumacher was used. More than 50 measurements were conducted, with case histories and courses being compiled from four of them. Reference is made to indications for intracranial pressure measurement as well as to pathophysiological aspects relating to increase in intrarcranial pressure. Ventriculometry in the context of a wider diagnostico-therapeutic regime on the intensive care unit was found to be conducive to target-oriented brain pressure prophylaxis and therapy.
