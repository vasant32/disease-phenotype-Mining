The value of transcranial Doppler sonography is demonstrated in two infants with an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). One of them suffered from hydrocephalus and ICP increased because of her VP shunt-insufficiency. In the other case status epilepticus caused brain oedema and a rise in intracranial pressure. In both cases, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a decrease in blood flow (CBF) velocity and an increase in the Pourcelot index in the middle cerebral artery. Quick or gradual reduction of the ICP led to an increase in CBF velocity and a decrease in the Pourcelot index. On the basis of experiences of the authors, transcranial Doppler sonography is a valuable method of verifying the elevation of ICP. It is suitable for measuring the effect of treatment necessitated by the elevation of ICP. The method is non-invasive, quick and it can be freely repeated. Therefore it is applicable for monitoring the dynamic of ICP.
