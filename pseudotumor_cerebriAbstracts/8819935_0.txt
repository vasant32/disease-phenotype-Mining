Benign endocranial hypertension (BEH) is defined as a syndrome the clinical symptomatology of which includes elevated intracranial pressure without signs of focal injury of the brain. There were 55 BEH patients (52 female and 3 male patients). Changes of endocrine status were found to prevail among etiological factors, viz. pregnancy, obesity, galactorrhea-amenorrhea, hypothyrosis, ingestion of oral contraceptives. All the patients showed signs of intracranial hypertension (headache, vomit, conjested optical disks). The spinal fluid pressure was elevated, with the cellular and protein composition being normal. The condition was marked by benign course and favourable outcome.
