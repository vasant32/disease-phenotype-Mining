The patient (woman), 54 years of age, treated for p-ANCA positive vasculitis, hypertension, and thyroid gland hypofunction was referred to our Department due to the decrease of the visual acuity of her left eye. Since the year 2003, she was followed-up in the Department of Neurology due to the idiopathic intracranial hypertension (the opening pressure of the intracranial liquid was 480 -500 mm of H2O column), treated by acetazolamide tablets (Diluran) 1/2 tablet once daily. She was followed-up for the bilateral persistent papilledema by the local ophthalmologist. Due to the progression of the visual acuity loss the decompression (fenestration) of the optic nerve sheath was performed, and the neurosurgeon recommended the lumbo-peritoneal shunting. Adequate indication and choice of the surgical treatment helped to stabilize visual functions.
