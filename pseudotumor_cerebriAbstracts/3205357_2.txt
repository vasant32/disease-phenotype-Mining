Lumbar subarachnoid pressure (LSP) was continuously monitored via intrathecally introduced polyethylene catheter to select the patients for shunt operation. A total of seventy cases included so-called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; 34 cases), idiopathic NPH (17 cases), secondary NPH whose symptoms developed after operations for brain tumors, head injuries or meningitis (12 cases) and other intracranial diseases including pseudotumor cerebri or meningeal carcinomatosis, etc. (7 cases). Shunt operation was effective in 36 cases and not effective in 9 cases, while 25 cases were not shunted since LSP was not elevated or clinical manifestations were slight. Mean values of baseline pressure and maximum pressure in shunt effective group, shunt non-effective group and non-shunted group were 14.5, 12.7, 9.0 and 29.9, 25.0, 17.9 mmHg, respectively. Statistical difference was observed between shunt effective group and non-shunted group. Frequency of pressure waves was also significantly higher in shunt effective group than in non-shunted group. Above all, measurement of LSP was regarded as useful in idiopathic NPH. However, preoperative clinical symptoms had a closer relationship to shunt response than results of LSP in post SAH patients. Complication related to this monitoring was negligible except in one case of meningitis which was easily treated by administration of antibiotics. Follow-up study also justified our selection since no further deterioration was noted in non-shunted group. The present study indicates that measurement of LSP would be useful in selecting the patients who will benefit from shunting and in eliminating unnecessary shunt operations because this simple method is easily performed at bed side without perforating the skull.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
