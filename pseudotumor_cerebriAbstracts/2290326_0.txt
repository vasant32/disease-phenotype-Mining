Altogether 45 patients (41 women and 4 men) with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) were observed. BIH developed in 22 women in the gestation period, in 4 during a menopause, in 2 in the presence of hypothyroidism, in 2 due to respiratory infection, in 2 due to a slight cerebrocranial injury, and in one patient with associated galactorrhea-amenorrhea. The cause of BIH in 12 patients remained unclear. Most of the women were obese (33 of 41). The clinical picture of BIH consisted of headaches, congested optic discs, and elevated pressure of cerebrospinal fluid. In most cases prognosis turned out favorable. In the residual period, 1 patient had amaurosis, 25 presented with mild headache, 19 completely recovered. Three women had recurrent BIH.
