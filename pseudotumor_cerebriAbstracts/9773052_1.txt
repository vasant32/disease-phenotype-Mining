We report a case of benign intracranial hypertension due to chronic A-hypervitaminosis and a review of literature with 30 cases in adults and adolescents. The most prominent clinical features are: predominance of young women with normal weight and cured for acne; benign intracranial hypertension without other symptoms in half of cases; wide difference of daily doses and time of continuous intake. Prognosis for vitamin A intoxication is good, when intake of vitamin is discontinued. We reviewed five cases of benign intracranial hypertension due to retinoic acid. The mechanism of vitamin A neurotoxicity is still unknown.
