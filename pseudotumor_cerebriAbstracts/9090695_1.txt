A 12-year-old girl with recent history of pseudotumor cerebri developed severe postural headache due to intracranial hypotension after lumbar puncture. Meningeal enhancement and thickening were demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging. Repeated imaging 3 months later disclosed no abnormalities. This is the first report of a child with evident meningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging related to lumbar puncture.
