During a 6-year period, 14 consecutive children with penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wounds (GSW) were studied. Eleven patients were comatose on admission. Five had an admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4 or less and developed clinical signs of brain death within 12 hours despite maximum therapeutic efforts. The remaining six patients, all of whom had three or more of the previously described unfavorable prognostic features, were aggressively managed with prophylaxis and treatment of intracranial hypertension. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was controlled with mechanical hyperventilation, mannitol osmotherapy, pentobarbital, and surgical decompression. Substantial intracranial hypertension occurred for up to 10 days after admission. There were four survivors. Neurobehavioral and intellectual functions were evaluated over a period of 1 to 2 years. Although serious cognitive deficits were noted, all survivors had sufficient functional recovery to warrant aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and measures to control ICP in the management of comatose victims of craniocerebral GSW.
