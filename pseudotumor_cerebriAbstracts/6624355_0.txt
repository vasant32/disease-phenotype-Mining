The results of intracranial pressure measurement and different methods of draining the ventricles of the brain in severe craniocerebral injury are analysed. The authors examined 30 patients who had been operated on for intracranial hematomas and contusion of the brain. The importance of intracranial pressure gradients in the genesis of dislocation processes is emphasized. It is recommended that drainage of the ventricles of the brain is performed under continuous control of the intracranial pressure in both hemispheres.
