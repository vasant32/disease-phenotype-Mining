This study is based on 11 cases with pseudotumour cerebri. In each case a high dose of Escin was administered intravenously, and the drug effect during ICP recording was observed. In seven cases the drug manifested a significant hypotensive effect. In these cases the treatment with Escin (20 mg every 8 hours) was continued for 3 days; the control if ICP after this period showed a normal pressure in all cases. Oral treatment was continued at the same dosage for 20-30 days and the patient was then discharged. All patients presented complete remission of the clinical syndrome and fundus normalization. Follow-up after a year showed no recurrence. In three cases the treatment with Escin was unsuccessful; these patients were given dexamethasone, with normalization of the syndrome. Another case that presented with a severe picture of intracranial hypertension and visual impairment was treated with Escin and dexamethasone without positive results. The patient improved with external CSF drainage, and was treated by a shunt procedure that induced remission of the syndrome.
