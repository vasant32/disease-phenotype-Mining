A 47-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with an optic disc edema detected during a routine health check. On admission, she exhibited bilateral optic disc edema without headache and no visual disturbance. Her cerebrospinal pressure was 440 mmH2O, but we detected no abnormalities in the CSF, blood tests, brain MRI or MRV. Therefore, she was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Treatment with acetazolamide reduced the cerebrospinal pressure. We suggest that examination of the optic fundi is sufficient to diagnose both IIH without headache and IIH with atypical symptoms.
