We studied brain water self diffusion in pseudotumour cerebri by MR-imaging using single spin echo pulse sequences with pulsed magnetic field gradients of different magnitude. The methods is based on the fact that the movement of water molecules is restricted in brain tissue and that accumulation of water in the brain tissue will enhance the self diffusion of water. In order to evaluate the brain water content in pseudotumour cerebri we compared the water self diffusion coefficient in various regions of the brain in pseudotumour patients with that of healthy controls. Ten patients with pseudotumour cerebri were studied. All had increased ICP and increased resistance to CSF outflow. All patients had normal conventional MR spin echo images without focal lesions and a normal sized ventricular system. All patients had abnormal diffusion images showing increased water diffusion. Some patients had in particular increased diffusion in the periventricular regions, others in the whole brain. The diffusion coefficients in all brain regions of interest were significantly higher in patients than in controls. The findings suggest that patients with pseudotumour cerebri have a convective transependymal flow of water causing an interstitial brain oedema and in addition an intracellular brain water accumulation.
