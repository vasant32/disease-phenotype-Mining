Headache (cephalgia) is one of the most common presenting complaints pregnant. Patients who report having had the same problem for some time prior to pregnancy do not usually have a neurological emergency. Chronic and recurrent headaches may be due to tension, migraine, sinusitis, pseudotumor cerebri or in many cases be unexplained. A patient with a neurological emergency does not present with a diagnosis but rather with one or several clinical manifestations. The nature of the presentation, sequence of events, and constellation of signs and symptoms suggests a differential diagnosis. Starting from the presentation, the physician must select diagnostic tests and procedures and then, once a diagnosis is made, initiate treatment.
