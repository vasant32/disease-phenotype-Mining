A 24-year-old woman with previously known pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) presented with severe pain in the neck and shoulders followed by the classical symptoms and signs of bilateral brachial neuritis. At the same time, there was a recurrence of the PTCS which had been in remission for more than one-and-a-half years. Despite treatment with high doses of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins and repeated cerebrospinal fluid drainage, both brachial plexopathy and the PTCS continued to worsen. Both lumbosacral plexuses became involved and the visual acuity deteriorated to a level such that a lumboperitoneal shunt had to be inserted. The neurological condition started to improve progressively after 8 weeks. This case is, to our knowledge, the first where brachial plexopathy has been described in association with a PTCS. Although the pathogenesis of this association is not clear, there are enough data to suggest the existence of a continuum between extended brachial plexopathy and Guillain Barre syndrome, with which PTCS has been associated in some instances.
