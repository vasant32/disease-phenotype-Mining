The intracranial pressure-volume relationship of brain elasticity was examined in 20 patients with suspected disorders of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system. Elasticity measurements were made as the patients were studied with a servo-controlled lumbar infusion technique to measure CSF absorptive capacity. The data were evaluated to determine the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and volume, and between ICP variability and the level of ICP. The results confirm the exponential nature of the pressure-volume elasticity function in patients who are not critically ill. Eight of the 20 patients were shown to have normal CSF absorptive capacities, and there was no difference between their elasticity measurements and those of patients with absorptive defects. In addition, ICP variability was shown to be linearly related to the actual level of ICP. The physiological features of the pressure-volume elasticity function are reviewed. Based on these considerations, the clinical value and significance of elasticity measurements is questioned.
