In an experimental model the effect of increased intracranial pressure on respiration and circulation was studied. Infusions of varying volumes of fluid into the subarachnoid space over the convexity of the brain in the right parietal area were carried out, recording then changes in respiration and arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ECG, paying attention to arrhythmias and ischaemic myocardial changes. Intracranial pressure rise caused a sympathetic system response with increased arterial blood pressure, increased heart rate and various arrhythmias, even ventricular fibrillation. The observed ischaemic changes, even those suggesting electric gap presence, were reversible indicating absence of fixed structural changes.
