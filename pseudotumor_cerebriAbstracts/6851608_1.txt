We report two cases of children, 7 and 14 yr old, in whom prolonged infusion of thiopental sodium (TS) was used to control intracranial hypertension previously unresponsive to conventional therapy. Intracranial hypertension followed removal of a large tumor in 1 case, and trauma in the other. TS was administered at a rate of up to 7 mg/kg . h for 8 days in 1 patient, and up to 12 mg/kg . h for 10 days in the other. Both children regained consciousness and made significant recovery of neurological function. The advantage and the side-effects of the prolonged use of TS for intracranial hypertension are discussed.
