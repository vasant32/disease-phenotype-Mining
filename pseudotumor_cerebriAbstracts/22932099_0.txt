Treatment of refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a challenging problem. We reported a refractory IIH patient who manifested with typical intracranial hypertensive symptoms successfully treated with endovascular stent implantation. Pre-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure is 36 cmH2O. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a stenotic lesion located at the right transverse sinus (TS). The stenotic TS returned to its normal caliber and the pressure gradient deceased from 36 mmHg to 4 mmHg after the stent placement. The intracranial hypertensive symptoms resolved and one month later, the CSF opening pressure decreased to 14 cmH2O.
