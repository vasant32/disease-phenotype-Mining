We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS who experienced a 47% weight gain over a period of a year after commencing treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and went on to develop benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). She was not on any other medication associated with BIH. Although weight gain has been reported in patients on treatment with protease inhibitors, such gains have been minimal to moderate. We are unaware of any previous report of this degree of weight gain or BIH in a patient on protease inhibitors.
