Neuroborreliosis is an infection of the nervous system caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, from which patients most commonly develop lymphocytic meningitis, radiculoneuritis, or cranial neuropathy. In this report a 9-year-old male with an unusual neurological complication of neuroborreliosis--benign intracranial hypertension (BIH)--is described. Clinical symptoms of BIH, which consist of increased CSF pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass or obstruction to the circulation of CSF, resolved completely after antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone.
