A baby with infantile spasms (West's syndrome) who developed acute-onset transient hydrocephalus 10 days after suspending ACTH treatment is described. Hydrocephalus is an unusual complication of ACTH therapy, the more common complication being benign intracranial hypertension. The probable common pathogenic mechanism of altered CSF reabsorption which may lead to the two different clinical states, depending on age of patient, is discussed.
