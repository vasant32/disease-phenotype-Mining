We report on an 8-year-old girl with hemolytic anemia because of infection with parvovirus B19 and increased intracranial pressure. She presented acutely with headache, vomiting, and mild scleral and mucosal icterus. Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited profound hemolytic anemia, papilledema, and increased intracranial pressure. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisone, and packed red blood cells. Concurrent with an improvement of her anemia, she experienced a gradual resolution of her headache, vomiting, and optic-disc swelling. Signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension may occur as a consequence of severe anemia, and are reversible upon correction of the underlying hematologic disorder.
