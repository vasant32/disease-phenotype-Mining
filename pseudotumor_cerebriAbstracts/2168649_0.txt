The article deals with the analysis of changes in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), brain perfusion pressure (BPR), and central venous pressure (CVP) during general anesthesia in 172 patients with tumorous, tumor-like, and vascular diseases of the brain. CSFP increased sharply during preanesthesia, in administration of inhalation anesthetics, and under the effect of inadequate anesthesia during trephination of the skull. The rise in CSFP in preanesthesia can be reduced by a combination of barbiturates with neuroleptanalgesics the administration of which is continued for up to 2-3 minutes of artificial lung ventilation through a mask. To correct the rise in CSFP during the use of 70% N2O, the authors recommend preliminary 5-10-minute anesthesia with a N2O + O2 (50:50) mixture and administration of sodium thiopental (2-3 mg/kg) or seduxen (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) in the first minutes of the postintubation period.
