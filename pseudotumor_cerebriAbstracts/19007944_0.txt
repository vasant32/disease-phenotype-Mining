Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) is rarely used in France. The aim of surgery is to release pressure around the optic nerve. Although debated, ONSF can be used in selected cases of benign intracranial hypertension. The authors describe the approach of the anterior part of the optic nerve and the technique itself. The indications, results and potential complications of this technique are developed in this paper.
