Computerized static perimetry must be regarded as the method of choice for monitoring the course of optic neuropathy in cases of pseudotumor cerebri. A discrete peripheral visual field depression is the first sign of optic nerve damage. If cranial hypertension persists the visual field depression gradually spreads toward the center. Ultimately central visual acuity deteriorates continuously. If the intracranial hypertension is reduced in good time the visual field defects are largely reversible and optic atrophy can be prevented.
