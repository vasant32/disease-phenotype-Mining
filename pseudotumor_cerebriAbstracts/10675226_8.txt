The association of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL-Abs) has been only acknowledged recently. However, its true incidence is as yet unknown. In this retrospective study, the co-occurrence of IIH and aCL-Abs was looked for among a relatively large group of patients diagnosed with IIH or PTC in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic during the years of 1992-8. All patients underwent routine blood tests and the presence of activated protein C resistance and protein S and protein C deficiency were recorded. ACL-Abs were determined in all patients. The co-occurrence of IIH and aCL-Abs was found in three out of 37 patients (8.1%), which is higher than the incidence of aCL-Abs in the general population but considerably lower than that reported in two previously published studies. The aCL-Ab positive patients in our series were significantly older and thinner than those in whom antibodies were undetected. In conclusion, it seems that patients with this association should be considered as a unique subgroup of IIH.
