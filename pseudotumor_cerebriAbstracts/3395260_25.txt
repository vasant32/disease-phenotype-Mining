We describe 29 men with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and compare them with aged-matched women with PTC and male control subjects. Pseudotumor cerebri occurs less frequently in men but in a similar age distribution. Although signs and symptoms of PTC are similar in men and women, men may require surgical treatment for impending visual loss. Black men appear to be at greater risk to loss of vision. Even though men with PTC are less likely to be obese than women, they tend to be more obese than control subjects and should be counseled on weight-reduction diets.
