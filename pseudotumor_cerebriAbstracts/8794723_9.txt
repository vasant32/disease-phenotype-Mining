PURPOSE: An 11-year-old boy had a one-month history of horizontal diplopia. Three years earlier, he had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation complicated by graft versus host disease. METHODS: The patient had esotropia and bilateral optic disk edema. A magnetic resonance imaging scan disclosed no intracranial lesion. The opening pressure of the lumbar puncture was 500 mm of water. Pseudotumor cerebri secondary to cyclosporine was diagnosed. RESULTS: The patient improved with resolution of his esotropia and diplopia within five days of discontinuing his cyclosporine. The optic disk edema resolved within three months. CONCLUSION: Cyclosporine must be added to the list of medications with a known association with pseudotumor cerebri.
