 BACKGROUND: We investigated a new minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a cadaveric model. This technique aims at establishing a communication between the intraorbital and intracranial compartments by creating a bone, dural, and periorbital window in the anterior cranial fossa. This procedure is predicated on intraorbital absorptive capability that has been demonstrated in animals and discussed in humans. METHODS: Three fresh cadaver heads were fixed in a head holder so as to mimic the hyperextended supine position. The procedure was conducted bilaterally in each specimen. Our technique is as follows: 1) An incision is made in the eyebrow medial to the supraorbital notch; 2) using an endoscope and a periosteal elevator, the intraorbital surface of the orbital roof is separated from the periorbita in an anteroposterior direction for a length of 1.5-2.5 cm; 3) a 1 cm of the exposed orbital roof is removed, and the dura and arachnoid are opened; and 4) slits are made in the exposed periorbita. RESULTS: We were able to create a communication between the intracranial and the intraorbital compartments in all specimens. CONCLUSION: Our technique is new and does not require any foreign body implantation. Its applicability in humans needs to be evaluated in a clinical context.
