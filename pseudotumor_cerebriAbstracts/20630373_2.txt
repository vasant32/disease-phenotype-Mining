BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a life-threatening condition that may present with symptoms and signs identical to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Both conditions consist of increased intracranial pressure (ICP); however, IIH shows no evidence of contributory intracranial pathology. Oral hormonally based contraceptive usage has been associated with both conditions as well. Because disc edema often occurs in CVST, and IIH and is evident in other sight- and life-threatening conditions such as intracranial mass lesions, neuroimaging and other ancillary testing must be conducted for definitive diagnosis. CASE: An 18-year-old white woman with IIH previously diagnosed presented with headaches and severe visual loss in the left eye. Bilateral disc edema with macular edema in the left eye (O.S.) was present. Threshold perimetry found bilaterally enlarged blind spots as well as a central scotoma O.S. Her medical history was significant for a right transverse, sigmoid and jugular siphon thrombosis secondary to a hypercoagulable state and associated with her use of oral birth control medication. Subsequent magnetic resonance venography (MRV) found the presence of CVST. Despite anticoagulation therapy and acetazolamide, she had severe, nonresolving papilledema. Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated. She recovered full visual fields and excellent visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Because of the similarity in clinical presentation of CVST and IIH, it is important to differentiate distinguishing characteristics of these diseases for correct diagnosis and prompt treatment.
