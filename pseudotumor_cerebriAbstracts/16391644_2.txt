CASE REPORT: Two patients with sickle cell disease presented with headaches and visual disturbances, typical complaints of this disorder. However, prompt diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and initiation of medical therapy lead to improved symptoms and restored vision. Ophthalmologists should consider sickle cell disease to be an independent risk factor for idiopathic intracranial hypertension when a patient is being assessed for visual disturbances. COMMENTS: Although a rare condition, idiopathic intracranial hypertension has several key signs useful in establishing a diagnosis. It is critical to recognize the warning signs and symptoms to prevent devastating ophthalmologic complications. We report the first cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients with the novel Quebec-Chori beta-chain variant of sickle cell disease.
