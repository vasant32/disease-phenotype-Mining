Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children is rare. We analyzed clinical presentation and outcome in eight patients (six girls and two boys) diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The mean age was 11.1 years. The most common clinical features were headache, papilledema and visual disturbance (visual loss and diplopia). Response to treatment was satisfactory in all patients except one who presented almost complete bilateral amaurosis requiring extracranial shunting and who later developed optic atrophy. Outcome is usually is benign, but given the possibility of severe loss of visual function, close ophthalmic follow-up is recommended until complete resolution.
