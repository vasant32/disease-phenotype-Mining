A 42 year-old woman was admitted with a subacute intracranial hypertension which improved under medical treatment. Angiographic data and CT scan showed enlarged ventricles. CSF showed 1.95 g/l of proteins. Five months later, a relapsing acute intracranial hypertension led to a ventricular derivation. CT scans, angiographies and ventriculography showed progressively enlarged ventricles but failed to disclose any intracranial tumor. A thoraco-lumbar tumor of the spinal cord was incidentally discovered and removed. Histopathology concluded to an ependymoma. No sign of recurrence has occurred after an eighteen month follow up. The pathogenesis of intracranial hypertension occurring in spinal cord tumors is discussed.
