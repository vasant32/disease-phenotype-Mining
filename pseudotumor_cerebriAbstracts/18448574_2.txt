Pseudotumor cerebri is a clinical condition marked by papilledema, normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, normal or small ventricles on radiography, and absence of an intracranial mass. In this condition, headache, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia are frequently observed. The cause is often unknown but can occur with certain drug ingestions or systemic inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The treatment is primarily focused on the correction of the underlying cause with measures to reduce the raised intracranial pressure. The most important complication is optic atrophy, which results in visual loss. The sixth cranial nerve is most commonly affected. The involvement of the third cranial nerve is distinctly unusual. The present report describes a unique case of bilateral oculomotor palsy with sparing of the papillary fibers. It resolved promptly on administration of acetazolamide.
