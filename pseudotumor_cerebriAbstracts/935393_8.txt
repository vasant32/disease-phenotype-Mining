The authors reviewed 17 patients with the clinical diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension (pseudomotor cerebri). All of these patients underwent CT scans of the head which were interpreted as normal. Comparison of mean ventricular size with that of a group of control subjects showed no significant difference. On the basis of this study and others cited, there would appear to be almost no instances in which invasive neuroradiological procedures would be required to confirm the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri.
