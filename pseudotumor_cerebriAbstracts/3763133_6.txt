The authors obtained automated static threshold visual fields in 44 eyes of 22 patients with pseudotumor cerebri. Severe defects were found in 9% and moderate defects in 68%. The pooled incidence of three recent studies using manual kinetic techniques also demonstrated 9% severe defects, but only 34% of eyes demonstrated moderate loss. In 20 of 44 eyes, the papilledema was felt to be severe or atrophic. In none of these eyes was a normal field obtained. Visual field defects in pseudotumor cerebri appear to be more common than previously thought.
