The pseudotumor cerebri, a neurological syndrome clinically characterized by headaches, vomiting and bilateral papilledema, occurred in two patients, previously subjected to total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, after initiation of levothyroxine replacement therapy. In patients with thyroid cancer, subjected to thyroidectomy and then thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the possible development of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome should be considered and differentiated from CNS symptoms due to brain metastases.
