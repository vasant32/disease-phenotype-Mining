Authors describe ocular and neurological findings in a 68 years old female patient with the intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). For developing edema of the optic nerve head on the fundus (oedema papillae), accompanied with lowered visual acuity and visual field defects, an urgent surgical treatment was indicated--the lumboperitoneal shunt was introduced. After the operation, although the atrophy of the optic nerve head atrophy occurred, the visual acuity was maintained and visual fields sensitivity improved.
