PURPOSE: Somatostatin (SST) analogues have been used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, pseudotumor cerebri, thyroid orbitopathy, and cystoid macular edema. There is a paucity of published data in regards to cell-specific distribution of SST receptors (SSTR) in normal human eye tissues. Gene expression for all five known SSTRs in normal human ciliary body/iris, retina, choroid, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were studied. METHODS: mRNA was isolated from human ocular tissues (iris/ciliary body, retina, and choroid) dissected from eight pairs of normal eyes (9-62 years) and from RPE cells grown in culture. RT-PCR was done for all five SSTRs in all analyzed tissues. Immunohistochemistry for SSTR1 and SSTR2 was performed on eight pairs of normal human eyes (28-74 years) imbedded in paraffin. RESULTS: SSTR1 to 5 genes are expressed in retina, SSTR1 and SSTR2 genes in cultured RPE cells, and SSTR1, 2, and 4 in ciliary body and choroid. SSTR1 and SSTR2 immunoreactivity (-ir) was observed on a variety of cells within all analyzed tissues including cornea, iris, trabecular meshwork, Schlemm's canal, ciliary processes, ciliary muscle, retina, choroid, cultured RPE cells, and optic nerve. CONCLUSIONS: SSTR genes are widely expressed in normal human eye tissues, with genes for SSTR1 and SSTR2 being the most widely expressed. Genes for all SSTRs are expressed in retina. SSTR1-ir and SSTR2-ir were observed in all analyzed ocular tissues. Detailed knowledge of SSTRs distribution and function in the human eye will result in a better understanding of their role in health and disease.
