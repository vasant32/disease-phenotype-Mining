BACKGROUND:: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) remains a poorly understood and therapeutically challenging disease. Enthusiasm has emerged for endovascular therapy with stent reconstruction of dural sinus narrowing (DSN); however, a complete understanding of the hydrodynamic dysequilibrium is lacking. OBJECTIVE:: To review and characterize catheter manometry findings including pulsatility changes within the venous sinuses in IIH. METHODS:: Cases of venous sinus stent implantation for IIH were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:: Three cases of venous sinus stent implantation for treatment of IIH are reported. All cases demonstrated severe narrowing (>70%) within the transverse sinus, and a high pressure gradient across the lesion (>30 mm Hg). Stent implantation resulted in pulsatility attenuation, correction of pressure gradient, and improvement of flow. CONCLUSION:: We report the finding of high venous sinus pulsatility attenuation after stent implantation for dural sinus narrowing and propose the hypothesis that this finding is a marker of advanced dural sinus incompetence. This characteristic may be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from endovascular stent remodeling.
