Sneddon's syndrome is a rare disease defined by the presence of ischemic cerebrovascular events associated with livedo reticularis. We report a retrospective study of fifteen cases, thirteen women and two men, mean age of 37.93+/-9.77 years. All patients presented one or more cerebral infarcts. Six patients had dementia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed several cortical infarcts with white matter involvement. Cerebral angiography performed in all patients, showed a distal arteriopathy in twelve and thrombosis of the right carotid internal artery in one. One patient had antiphospholipid antibodies. Ten patients were treated with antiplatelet agents and five with anticoagulants. The course was favorable in eight patients and stationary in three. Four patients had several recurrent infarcts, one when anticoagulants were discontinued, one taking an anti-sludge-platelet agent and two who were not initially taking any treatment.
