Sneddon syndrome (SS) is characterized by livedo racemosa, recurrent ischemic strokes, and often progressive vascular dementia. Treatment options for SS center on either anticoagulation or immunosuppression to prevent strokes and to dissipate the skin findings, with these modalities based historically on the presence or absence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) respectively. However, few effective treatments have been reported to reverse the cognitive decline in SS. We report a case of a woman with seronegative SS (absence of APA) with cognitive decline who demonstrated objective and subjective improvements in her memory and emotional functioning after treatment with cyclophosphamide.
