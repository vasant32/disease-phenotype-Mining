Following the publications on the connection between Sneddon's syndrome and the antiphospholipid++ syndrome, the attention of researchers concentrated on the reproductive problems of women comprising the greater part of patients suffering from Sneddon's syndrome. One of the main indications of these almost coinciding syndromes are miscarriages for no obvious reason. It is supposed that the general mechanism is thrombosis. In a group of 38 patients with Sneddon's syndrome 32 (84%) are women. Twenty-eight of them have altogether given bright 43 times. Seven of them have suffered miscarriages for no obvious reason and three have habitual miscarriages. Three women have sterility problems.
