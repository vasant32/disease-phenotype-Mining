The Sneddon's syndrome consists of neurologic manifestations associated to the presence of livedo reticularis and cyanosis of the extremities. The pathological process is an endothelial obliteration of arterioles, leading to a reticular appearance of the skin, despite the environment temperature. The authors present three new cases, caucasian males with 7, 16 and 54 years of age. The youngest started with hemilateralized motor seizures and showed a porencefalic area in the CT scan. The oldest had livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis and started with hemilateralized motor seizures, and a hemiparesis as sequela; CT scan with parasagittal infarct and occlusion presented of one anterior cerebral artery on angiography. The third patient started with hemifacial seizures, developed a labioglossolaringeal paresis and dysarthria as sequela; CT scan and MRI showed multiple infarcts, with multiple occlusions of cortical branches on angiography. The skin biopsies showed endothelial vascular hyperplasia in all cases. Only one (54 years old) patient had a positive IgG antiphospholipid antibodies. The Sneddon's syndrome seems not to be so rare and have to be considered in the etiological investigation of cerebral infarcts, mainly in young people.
