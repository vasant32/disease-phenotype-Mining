We describe two cases of livedo racemosa generalisata with cerebrovascular defects (Sneddon syndrome). The histology is characterized by a proliferation and migration of medial smooth muscle cells in ascending arterioles of the upper subcutis and deep dermis. Migrating smooth muscle cells with a high content of intermediate filaments colonize the sub-endothelial intimal space, with subsequent narrowing of the vessel lumen. Since the discoloration of the skin is provoked by a reactive dilatation of venules, the biopsy should be performed in the adjacent normal-looking skin, taking in the upper subcutis.
