We present two patients with livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular accidents (Sneddon's syndrome) and positive anticardiolipin antibodies. We suggest that these antibodies may be pathophysiologically related to the clinical manifestation observed in some patients with this syndrome. When Sneddon's syndrome is associated with positive anticardiolipin antibodies it could be regarded as antiphospholipid syndrome and fall into this category of nosological entity.
