Sneddon's syndrome (SS) is characterized by ischemic cerebrovascular episodes and livedo reticularis. It is more common in young women and can also be associated with valvulopathy, a history of spontaneous abortion, renal involvement and vascular dementia. We describe three cases of young women with this disease. The patients had repeated ischemic cerebral episodes, livedo reticularis and thrombocytopenia. CT and MRI showed strokes and cerebral atrophy. Autopsy in one of the patients revealed cerebral infarctions. Anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in two patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be found in some patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events and livedo reticularis. SS may thus be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. We described three new cases of SS and discuss the pathophysiology of this disease.
