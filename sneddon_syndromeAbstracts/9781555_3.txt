Sneddon's syndrome is a rare neurodermatologic disorder that is manifested by multiple cerebrovascular accidents and livedo reticularis. The authors describe two siblings from one family with Sneddon's syndrome, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. The propositus presented with internuclear ophthalmoplegia and ophthalmic artery occlusion. These manifestations as well as the autosomal recessive inheritance have not yet been reported in Sneddon's syndrome.
