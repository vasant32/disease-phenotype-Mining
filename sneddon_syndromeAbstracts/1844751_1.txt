An association between anti-phospholipid antibodies and different disorders of the central nervous system has been described recently. We used an ELISA technique and detected anti-cardiolipin antibodies of the IgG or IgM variety in a series of 10 patients: 4 had occlusive stroke, 2 brain hemorrhage, 2 chorea, 1 a Sneddon syndrome and 1 vascular cephalea. The diagnosis of primary anti-phospholipid syndrome was suggested after ruling out systemic lupus in all patients.
