Clinical significance of a soluble vascular adhesion-1 molecule (pVCAM-1) in Sneddon's syndrome (SS) was studied in 48 SS patients by examination of serum pVCAM-1 level using enzyme immunoassay (R&D, USA). High serum concentration of pVCAM-1 registered in 62.6% of SS patients was associated with extracerebral thromboses, not with severity of cerebral vessel damage. Lethal outcomes for 2 years of follow-up occurred more frequently in patients with a high basal level of pVCAM-1 than in patients with normal level. Thus, development of the pathological process in SS is associated with elevated concentration of serum pVCAM-1 and may serve an additional laboratory indicator of developing extrabrain thrombotic disorders and marker of unfavourable prognosis.
