We report on a 54-year-old woman with Sneddon's syndrome manifested by livedo reticularis, fetal losses, hypertension, and high antinuclear antibody titres. At the age of 42 years she developed tremor of the trunk, limbs, and head only in the standing position that interfered with walking, followed some years later by cognitive decline and a parkinsonian syndrome. T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal in cortical areas, basal ganglia, midbrain, and cerebellum.
