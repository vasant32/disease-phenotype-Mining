INTRODUCTION: Sneddon's syndrome is the association between livedo reticularis and stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes in Sneddon's syndrome are exceptional. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old woman who had had a livedo reticularis for about 14 years attended the Emergency Unit complaining of sudden, severe headache and numbness and weakness in her left extremities. Physical examination revealed left supranuclear facial palsy and left crural hemiparesis and hemihypoalgesia. Cranial CT showed a right parieto-occipital lobar haemorrhage. Immunological studies, including antiphospholipid antibodies, were negative. A cerebral angiography showed anomalies in most distal branches of intracranial arteries. Biopsies of the skin and digital arteries yielded non conclusive results. CONCLUSION: The association between livedo reticularis and stroke, together with the angiographic findings led us to the diagnosis of Sneddon's syndrome. When comparing our case with similar ones, we must point out to its onset with a hemorrhagic stroke and to the lobar location of the bleeding.
