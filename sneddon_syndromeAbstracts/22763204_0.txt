Few vascular dementias are diagnosed in memory clinic consultations. One type, a rare etiology, Sneddon syndrome, can lead patients to consult for an isolated memory complaint. We report the cases of two patients, aged 63 and 66 years, who presented frontocortical cognitive profile and behavior disorders. Seronegative Sneddon syndrome, complicated with dementia, was diagnosed in each case by noticing an association between, on MRI, an atrophy and several ischemic cerebrovascular accident aftermaths, and a livedo racemosa. Management of vascular risks factors improves the prognosis.
