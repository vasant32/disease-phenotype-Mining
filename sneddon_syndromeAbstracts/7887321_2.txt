Sneddon syndrome is a clinical entity that is characterized by livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular lesions and is considered to be a subtype of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Central retinal artery occlusion is one of the ophthalmic complications of this syndrome and its prognosis of visual acuity is generally poor. We report here a 50-year-old man with Sneddon syndrome who had recurrent central retinal artery occlusion with recovery of visual function after each episode.
