Sneddon syndrome--cerebrovascular lesions and livedo racemosa--is a distinctive and uncommon disorder delineated by Sneddon in 1965. The clinical hallmarks are generalized livedo racemosa and central nervous system ischemia. Cutaneous vascular changes begin with intimal endothelial proliferation and fibromucinous matrix formation, leading to obstruction and obliteration of the vessel. The disorder is slowly progressive. No effective treatment is available, but platelet-inhibiting agents or newer antithrombotic agents may offer some hope in preventing or minimizing serious sequelae of this disease.
