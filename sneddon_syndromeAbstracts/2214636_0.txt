Besides cerebrovascular pathology and livedo, cardiac affections are introduced in clinical manifestations of Sneddon's syndrome. They involve coronary heart disease (up to development of MI), murmur (usually mitral), occasional cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with coronary disease and cardiac murmur show antibodies to cardiolipin significantly more frequently. The role of antibodies to cardiolipin in the genesis of cardiac alterations in Sneddon's syndrome is open to discussion.
