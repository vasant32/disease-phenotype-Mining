A 43 year old woman suffered from an intermittent painful livedo racemosa at the back since her childhood. Her clinical course was complicated by ulcerations. In careful clinical investigations no signs of an underlying disease could be found, in particular a Sneddon syndrome could be excluded. By means of both conservative and surgical treatments, initial healing of the ulcerations was achieved but relapses occurred. Cyclic infusions of iloprost achieved long-term clearing of the ulcerations and disappearance of the pain. To the best of our knowledge the effectiveness of this treatment has not been described for this disease in the literature.
