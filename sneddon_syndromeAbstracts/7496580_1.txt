A 27-year old woman is presented with a five year old history of Sneddon's syndrome in whom recently peripheral retinal neovascularization in both eyes was discovered. Sneddon's syndrome is a rare clinical entity first described in 1965 and characterized by typical skin lesions (livedo reticularis) and cerebrovascular lesions occurring at early age. Central retinal artery occlusions have been reported twice in Sneddon-patients, but peripheral retinal capillary occlusions and neovascularization have not yet been reported. The role of the antiphospholipid antibodies in this association is discussed.
