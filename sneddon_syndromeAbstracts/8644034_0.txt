Endothelial antibodies (EAB) were determined by enzyme immunoassay in 39 patients with Sneddon syndrome. EAB were detected in 12 patients (31%). Antibodies to phospholipids occurred more frequently in EAB-positive patients. Clinically, EAB-positive and EAB-negative patients were similar except renal syndrome which in the form of proteinuria was more frequent in EAB-positive subjects.
