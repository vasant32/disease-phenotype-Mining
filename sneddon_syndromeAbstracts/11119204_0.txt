Sneddon's syndrome is a rare disease with strong gender prevalence of females. This syndrome is characterized by livedo racemosa and cerebrovascular lesions. Since no specific test is available, the clinical differentiation from other disorders with similar symptomatology may raise difficulties. The cerebral involvement includes strokes with cases of more than one ischaemic event having been reported. Associations with convulsions, heart valve disease, systemic hypertension, and renal impairment have been described. We report the case of a 5-year-old boy who was anaesthesized for dental surgery. Due to the fact that 50% of Sneddon's syndrome patients develop mental retardation, even minor procedures require general anaesthesia. A review of the literature is added and specific anaesthesiological aspects of the perioperative care of Sneddon's syndrome are discussed.
