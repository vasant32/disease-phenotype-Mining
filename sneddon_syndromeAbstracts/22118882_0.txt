Sneddon's syndrome (SS) is an uncommon disorder, characterized by the association of ischemic stroke and widespread livedo reticularis. The treatment options for SS to prevent stroke recurrence and future disability include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, or immunosuppression. We describe a patient with SS who presented with an acute ischemic stroke, and was treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator with significant neurologic improvement. To our knowledge this is the first report of the use of thrombolysis in SS patients with acute ischemic stroke. It suggests that thrombolytic therapy might be safe and effective in these patients.
