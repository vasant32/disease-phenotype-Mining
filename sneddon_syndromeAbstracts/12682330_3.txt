The authors report the neuropathologic findings in a case of Sneddon's syndrome. There were multiple small, predominantly cortical, infarcts, with focal hyperplasia and fibrotic occlusion of arterial vessels in the superficial white matter, cortex, and leptomeninges. A very occasional arterial thrombus was seen. These findings suggest that Sneddon's syndrome is caused by a noninflammatory arteriopathy affecting superficial cerebral vessels.
