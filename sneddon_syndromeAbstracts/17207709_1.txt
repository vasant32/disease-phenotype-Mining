We have studied the relationship between the histocompatibility class I and II antigens and Sneddon's syndrome (SS) in a Spanish patient with SS and her relatives (13 available members of an extensive 3-generation pedigree with diverse autoimmune hypercoagulation abnormalities). The patient and her father were diagnosed with a primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and were HLA-A30-B13-Bw6. In addition, a HLA-Bw6-DQ1 association was present in all the members of this kindred. These data suggest that the combination of the histocompatibility class I and II antigens in this family may be a marker for predisposition to SS.
