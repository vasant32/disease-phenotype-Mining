We describe a 11 year-old-boy with Sneddon syndrome, confirmed by skin biopsy, and MR evidence of diffuse cerebral hyperintensity of white matter; he also suffered from pre-perinatal hypoxic-ischemic distress. Arylsulfatase A activity was found reduced because of arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency. We suggest that the association of pre-perinatal distress, Sneddon syndrome and arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency is responsible for the diffuse impairment of cerebral white matter, never reported in Sneddon syndrome and similar to described cases of delayed posthypoxic demyelination and arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency.
