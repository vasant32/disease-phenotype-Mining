The authors report the case of three middle-aged women admitted to the hospital because of cerebro-vascular accidents, in whom examination disclosed idiopathic livedo reticularis. This association has only been described recently, but does not seem fortuitous; some of the clinical manifestations are characteristic, but the histology is usually nonspecific and the basic abnormality remains unknown. The main problem is prognostic and therapeutic. In an attempt to prevent the neurological defects, tobacco and contraception should not be permitted to female patients showing widespread acquired livedo reticularis; high blood-pressure should be treated systematically.
