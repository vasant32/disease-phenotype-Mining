Renal artery pseudoaneurysms are infrequent and are most often secondary to surgical or percutaneous renal biopsies. Their rupture can cause rapid clinical deterioration by massive haemorrhage. Diagnosis and treatment must, therefore, be rapid. Currently, surgical treatment remains the gold standard in most institutions while paediatric cases of endovascular embolization have seldom been described. We report a 13-month-old infant with a post-biopsy renal pseudoaneurysm successfully treated by selective arterial embolization.
