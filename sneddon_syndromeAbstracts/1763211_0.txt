The association of livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular lesions is known as Sneddon's syndrome. It affects young adults and is more common in females. Repeated strokes lead these patients to residual deficits. Recently, Sneddon's syndrome has been described in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematous and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We report two cases, one of them with antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies do not seem to explain the events of Sneddon's Syndrome. Perhaps, different pathogenic mechanisms play role in the clinical expression of this syndrome.
