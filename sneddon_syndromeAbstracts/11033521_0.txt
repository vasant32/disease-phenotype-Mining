Anticancer drugs rarely cause strokes. We report the case of a woman treated for a kidney cancer by IL2 and IFN alpha, having developed multiple strokes associated with a livedo. The responsibility of IL2 and IFN alpha seemed likely. The association with a transitory livedo suggested that the pathological process might be a cerebral angiopathy with arterial vasospasms.
