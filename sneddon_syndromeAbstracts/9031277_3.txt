Sneddon's syndrome is a systemic disease characterized by livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular disease. Other organs may be involved as well. Typical vascular lesions in the skin biopsy and/or digital arteries biopsy can be found. Arterial hypertension, cardiac pathology (ischemic disease, myocardial infarction, valvulopathy), venous thrombosis and even fetal death are also found sometimes. We present a case of Sneddon's syndrome in which typical vascular lesions in the kidney were demonstrated for the first time unequivocally confirming the systemic nature of this syndrome.
