There is presented a case a 42 year old woman, who was admitted to the Department of Internal Diseases, the Institute of Dentistry, Medical Academy in Warsaw, with suspected bacterial endocarditis. Two episodes which indicate a lesion in the central nervous system (as right side hemiparesis and mixed aphasia) in the patients with valvular heart disease, were the basis of this suspicion. Bacterial endocarditis was not confirmed during hospitalisation. Diagnosis of Sneddon's syndrome was established based on skin lesion of livedo reticulatis type with typical picture in skin biopsy and on the lesions in the central nervous system confirmed by MRI. Moreover the patients had arterial hypertension and Raynaud's syndrome. We presented the diagnostic difficulties of Sneddon's syndrome, a course of the disease, the factors, which affect its prognosis and attempts to treat this syndrome based on this case.
