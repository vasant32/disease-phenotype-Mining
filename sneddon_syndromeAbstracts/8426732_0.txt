A 39 year old female patient has had reticular skin lesions showing the clinical picture of livedo racemosa for 7 years. Her medical history revealed cerebrovascular disease. In the background of livedo racemosa no systemic disorder could be detected, so the authors considered their case to be Sneddon's syndrome. In the serum of the patient antiphospholipoid antibodies (high anticardiolipin antibody titer, factor lupus anticoagulant) could be detected so the diagnosis mentioned in the title seemed to be correct.
