Sneddon syndrome is know as the association of idiopathic livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular lesions. The most characteristic trait of this syndromes is a non-inflammatory arteriopathy in medium caliber vessels. The pathogenic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in this disease is not clear. Clinical characteristics and etiopathogenic features of eight patients with Sneddon's syndrome are reviewed, specially regarding its relationship with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. A female predominance was found (3:1) as well as a relationship with hypertension (five patients suffered hypertension), but no relation was found with contraceptive use. Three patients showed evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies, present as anticardiolipin antibodies with significative titers in three cases and lupus anticoagulant in one. Digital artery biopsy performed in four patients showed in all of them the pathologic features characteristic of this disease. Seven patients were treated with platelet activity inhibitors and one with oral anticoagulants. Six of them have had a year and half follow-up without showing any new ischemic stroke. The main etiopathogenic factor on Sneddon's syndrome is the presence of a non-inflammatory arteriopathy in medium caliber vessels. Blood hypertension and antiphospholipid antibodies could play a role in the development of cerebrovascular lesions in some cases. No relationship has been found with oral contraceptives in this series of patients. Medium term prognosis with platelet activity inhibitors therapy seems benign.
