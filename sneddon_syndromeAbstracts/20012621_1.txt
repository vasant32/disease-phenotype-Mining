The main objective of this study was to compare clinical and laboratory data obtained from patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) with and without Sneddon's syndrome (SS). A transverse study with 54 (85.2% female) PAPS patients (Sapporo criteria) was performed. Demographic, drug use, and antiphospholipid antibodies data were evaluated, as well as clinical and laboratory findings of SS. Patients were subdivided into one of two groups: PAPS with SS and PAPS without SS. Both groups were similar with respect to age (p = 0.05), gender (p = 0.34), race (p = 0.31), weight (p = 0.93), height (p = 0.27), and body mass index (p = 0.75); however, the SS group exhibited higher disease duration (96.0 ± 54.9 vs. 55.2 ± 52.0 months, p = 0.01). By definition, all PAPS with SS patients suffer from stroke, an arterial event; the frequency of stroke events (28.5 vs. 7.5%, p = 0.04), as well as of limb ischemia (100 vs. 30.0%, p < 0.0001) was higher in this group than in the PAPS without SS group. On the other hand, patients in the PAPS without SS group had more venous events, such as deep venous thrombosis, than those in the PAPS with SS group (80.0 vs. 50.0%, p = 0.03). In conclusion, an understanding of the relationship between APS and SS is important in order to identify a subgroup for which more rigorous accompaniment and therapy may be necessary.
