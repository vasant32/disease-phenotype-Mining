Eight attacks of transient global amnesia were observed in a female patient who suffered from livedo reticularis and a series of other neurological symptoms, which were transient in most stances. The neurological deficits include focal epileptic attacks, unilateral loss of vision, paresis of left arm and/or leg and dysarthria. The first amnestic attack was seen at the age of 19. The episodes lasted from a few to 3 days. The intervals between the amnestic episodes varied between a few days and 11 years. The livedo reticularis became more obvious during each neurological episode and was less pronounced during the time of remission. A benign type of essential hypertension and parproteinemia (gamma-M) was found. The investigations failed to show any evidence of essential thrombocythemia, polyarteriitis nodosa, lupus erythematodes and other immune complex diseases. The underlaying disease remained unclear.
