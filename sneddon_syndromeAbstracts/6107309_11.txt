Livedo reticularis is a clinical pattern of cutaneous vascular involvement that can be seen in association with many diseases. The association of livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular accidents has been reported rarely in the past. We report on a 52-year-old woman with marked generalized livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular accidents who exhibited endarteritis obliterans without other pathologic changes on histologic examination of the skin. This constellation of findings suggest a primary vasculopathy with rather extensive involvement which merits our attention and further study.
