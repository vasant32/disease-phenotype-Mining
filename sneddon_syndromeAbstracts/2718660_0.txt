In combined immunological investigation of 24 patients with Sneddon syndrome, 16 showed the decreased content of T-lymphocytes and theophylline-sensitive cells, increased content of B-lymphocytes, increased levels of IgM and circulating immune complexes. In 80% of the patients the leukocyte adherence inhibition test has revealed the blood cell sensitization against nervous tissue antigens, basic myelin protein of purified protein derivative. The data suggest the participation of autoimmune mechanisms in the Sneddon syndrome pathogenesis.
