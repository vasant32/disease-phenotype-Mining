Mesenteric ischaemia is a rare but serious cause of abdominal pain. We present the case of a man with Sneddon's syndrome, who had symptomatic mesenteric ischaemia secondary to a superior mesenteric artery stenosis in conjunction with a hepatic artery stenosis. As far as the authors are aware, this has not previously been described in Sneddon's syndrome, which is a vascular systemic disease characterized by an association between cerebrovascular accidents and a livedo reticularis skin rash. He was treated with balloon angioplasty and stent insertion, with good symptomatic improvement. This has implications for other stenoses in this condition should they become symptomatic.
