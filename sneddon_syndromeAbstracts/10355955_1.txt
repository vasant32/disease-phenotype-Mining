We report a 50-year-old woman diagnosed with Sneddon's syndrome and examined by CBF scintigraphy several times for follow-up of the disease. There were no significant changes in her CBF scintigraphic findings or neurological status during the 6-year follow-up period. Sneddon's syndrome is a slowly progressive disorder in which livedo reticularis precedes cerebrovascular accidents. Because small cortical arteries are predominantly affected in Sneddon's syndrome, MR and conventional angiography often fail to show any abnormal findings, and MR imaging may not visualize decreased CBF in the early stage. Therefore, CBF scintigraphy should be performed in patients who have or are suspected of having Sneddon's syndrome.
