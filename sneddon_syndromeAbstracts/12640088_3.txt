Sneddon syndrome (SS) is increasingly recognised as a cause of ischaemic stroke in young adults. As the natural course of SS is not well defined, the authors performed a prospective six year clinical and neuroradiological follow up study. Thirteen patients with definite diagnosis of SS (livedo racemosa, characteristic skin biopsy, and history of stroke) entered a follow up programme that consisted of clinical examinations, two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations, and a comprehensive laboratory follow up protocol. The most frequent clinical findings during follow up had been headache (62%) and vertigo (54%). Seven patients (54%) suffered from transient ischaemic attacks, however, completed stroke has not been obtained during follow up. Progression of white matter lesions detected in MRI were present in 10 of 13 patients. Laboratory follow up protocol revealed transient antiphospholipid antibodies in two subjects. This prospective six year follow up study suggests a low incidence of territorial stroke but outlines progressive leucencephalopathy in patients with SS.
