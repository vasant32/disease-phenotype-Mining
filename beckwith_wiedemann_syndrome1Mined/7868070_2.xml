<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Principally, parental imprinting refers to a parent-of-origin dependent expression of a subset of autosomal loci, independent of the sex of the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today, at least seven such loci have been identified, including the human IGF2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It appears that the set of imprinted genes is not always identical between the species, although the importance of maintaining this kind of gene regulation is evolutionarily conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that the four different human IGF2 promoters are expressed mono- and/or biallelically in complex patterns in postnatal liver specimens </plain></SENT>
