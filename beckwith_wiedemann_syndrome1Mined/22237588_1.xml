<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imprinting is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mammalian development and its disruption can cause various developmental defects and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The process of imprinting in the germline involves DNA methylation of the imprint control regions (ICRs), and resulting parental-specific methylation imprints are maintained in the zygote and act as the marks controlling imprinted gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in mice have revealed new factors involved in imprint establishment during gametogenesis and maintenance during early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have identified cases of imprinting disorders where involvement of factors shared by multiple ICRs for establishment or maintenance is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, transient neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Silver-Russell syndrome and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More severe disruptions can lead to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020217" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HYDM">molar pregnancy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imprinting defects may also occur during assisted reproductive technology or cell reprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on the mechanisms of imprint establishment and maintenance, and discuss the relationship with various human disorders </plain></SENT>
