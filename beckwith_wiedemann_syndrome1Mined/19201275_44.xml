<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review currently available literature on the association between imprinting disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> [BWS], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> [AS] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>) and assisted reproductive technology (ART) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Publications related to imprinting/epigenetic disorders including BWS, AS, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> with ART, as well as articles publishing outcome of ART, including IVF and ICSI from July 1978 to February 2008, were identified using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Considerable evidence in animal studies has demonstrated alteration in gene imprinting of embryos cultured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Publications from Europe, the United States, and Australia have suggested an association between ART and BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, more than 90% of children with BWS that were born after ART had imprinting defects, compared with 40%-50% of children with BWS and conceived without ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there have been other reports suggesting an association between AS and ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of children with AS born after ART had an imprinting defect as the underlying etiology, specifically loss of methylation of the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a single report suggesting an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> in children conceived with ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Because the absolute incidence of imprinting disorders is small (&lt;1:12,000 births), routine screening for imprinting disorders in children conceived by ART is not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional large cohort studies of children born after ART are needed to determine whether there is a genuine association between ART and imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
