<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such methylation distinguishes male and female genomes and is inherited in a parent-of-origin-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sex-specific imprints are established in the germline during gametogenesis and remain intact throughout embryonic and postnatal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming of methylation patterns in gametes is essential to sex-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of imprinted genes and assures exclusive harboring of female- and male-specific imprinted patterns in maternal and paternal gametes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequences of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> are manifested by its loss, which can lead to a variety of disorders, the most prominent ones being Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a great deal of research has been carried out to examine various imprinting mechanisms, little is known about the establishment and regulation of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we describe several epigenetic mechanisms that have relevance in imprinting and that may have impact on embryonic development, fetal growth and animal cloning </plain></SENT>
