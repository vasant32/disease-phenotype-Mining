<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The many examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> have been enumerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Much information in recent years has increased our understanding of the mechanism of these conditions in the newborn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continued research of the biochemical and physiologic bases for alterations of carbohydrate metabolism should further enhance our ability to diagnose and treat the neonate effectively </plain></SENT>
