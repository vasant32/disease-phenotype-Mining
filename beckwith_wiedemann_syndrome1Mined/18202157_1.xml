<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epigenetic studies, such as the measurement of DNA methylation, are important in the investigation of syndromes influenced by imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quick and accurate quantification of methylation at such genes can be of appreciable <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first digested genomic DNA with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and used DNA without digestion as a control and nonmethylated lambda DNA as an internal control for digestion efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then performed quantitative real-time PCR analyses with 6 unique PCR assays to investigate 4 imprinting control regions on chromosomes 7 and 11 in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7 (UPD7) and in control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our validation of the method demonstrated both quantitative recovery and low methodologic imprecision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The imprinted loci on chromosome 7 behaved as expected in maternal UPD7 (100% methylation) and paternal UPD7 (&lt;10% methylation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In controls, the mean (SD) for percent methylation at 2 previously well-studied restriction sites were 46% (6%) for both H19 and KCNQ1OT1, a result consistent with the previously observed methylation rate of approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methylation percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated imprinted loci were normally distributed, implying that the mean and SD can be used as a reference for screening methylation loss or gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The investigated loci are of particular importance for investigating the congenital Silver-Russell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e>; however, the method can also be applied to other imprinted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method is easy to set up, has no PCR bias, requires small amounts of DNA, and can easily be applied to large patient populations for screening the loss or gain of methylation </plain></SENT>
