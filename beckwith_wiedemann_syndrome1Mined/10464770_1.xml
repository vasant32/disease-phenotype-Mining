<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The process can occur coordinately within large physical domains in mammalian chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One interesting facet of the study of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> is that it offers insight into the regulation of large chromosomal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding this regulation involves elucidating the cis-acting regulators of gene expression and defining the elements that maintain chromatin insulation, both required for understanding more practically applicable areas of biological research, such as efficient transgene production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review is focused on the regulation of the imprinted domain of human chromosome 11p15.5, responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent findings indicate that the maintenance of imprinting within this domain is critically dependent on the stable maintenance of chromatin insulation </plain></SENT>
