<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alveolar RMS was diagnosed on the basis of excisional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was initiated and followed by bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient, who is now 3 years and 11 months of age, is alive 46 months after the initial diagnosis, albeit with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could not detect the PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR transcripts; however, we could observe hypomethylation of the differentially methylated region of the long QT intronic transcript 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, neonatal alveolar RMS with BWS may result from an alternate molecular pathway </plain></SENT>
