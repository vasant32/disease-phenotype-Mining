<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A female child with features fitting in with the BWS diagnostic framework and an apparent loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene in 11p15.5 was also reported to have a de novo chromosome 18q segmental deletion (Patient 1), thus pointing at the location of a possible trans-activating regulator element for maintenance of IGF2 imprinting and providing one of the few examples of locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second child with de novo 18q23 deletion and features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>naevus</z:hpo> flammeus, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, thus also fitting in with the BWS diagnostic framework, is here fully reported (Patient 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this child, an analysis of the BWS1 locus precluded any paternal isodisomy and showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting pattern (mono-allelic expression of IGF2 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 and CDKN1OT1/LIT1 methylation index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Patients 1 and 2, deletions were shown to overlap, defining a minimal region of haplo-insufficiency of 3.8-5.6 Mb in 18q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this region provides a candidate location for an original <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> condition with strong overlap with BWS, but without obvious upstream functional relationship with the BWS1 locus in 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because this minimal region of haplo-insufficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> into a common region of deletion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">18q- syndrome</z:e>, we inferred that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> condition would follow a recessive pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
