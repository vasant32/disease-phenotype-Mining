<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The finding of a mixture of 46,XX and 46,XY cells in an individual has been rarely reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It usually results in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000062'>ambiguous genitalia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of true human hermaphrodites show this type of karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be the result of mosaicism or chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By definition, a chimera is produced by the fusion of two different zygotes in a single embryo, while a mosaic contains genetically different cells issued from a single zygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms are involved in the production of chimera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stricto sensu, chimerism occurs from the post-zygotic fusion of two distinct embryos leading to a tetragametic chimera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are other entities, which are also referred to as chimera: parthenogenetic chimera and chimera resulting from fertilization of the second polar body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a particular type of chimera called 'androgenetic chimera' recently described in fetuses with placental mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in rare patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strategies to study mechanisms leading to the production of chimera and mosaics are also proposed </plain></SENT>
