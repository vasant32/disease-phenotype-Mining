<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BWS is thought to involve one or more imprinted genes, since some patients show paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, and others show balanced germ-line chromosomal rearrangements involving the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously mapped BWS, by genetic linkage analysis, to 11p15.5, which we and others also found to contain several imprinted genes; these include the gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) and H19, which show abnormal imprint-specific expression and/or methylation in 20% of BWS patients, and p57KIP2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which we found showed biallelic expression in one of nine BWS patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, p57KIP2 was recently reported to show mutations in two of nine BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now analyzed the entire coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of p57KIP2 in 40 unrelated BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, only two (5%) showed mutations, both involving frameshifts in the second exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, the mutation was transmitted to the proband's mother, who was also affected, from the maternal grandfather, suggesting that p57KIP2 is not imprinted in at least some affected tissues at a critical stage of development and that haploinsufficiency due to mutation of either parental allele may cause at least some features of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low frequency of p57KIP2 mutations, as well as our recent discovery of disruption of the K(v)LQT1 gene in patients with chromosomal rearrangements, suggest that BWS can involve disruption of multiple independent 11p15.5 genes </plain></SENT>
