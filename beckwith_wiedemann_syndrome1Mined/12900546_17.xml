<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such regulation is epitomized by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and autosomal imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In XCI, TSIX serves as an antisense regulator of XIST, the silencer element for XCI which itself makes a non-coding transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerous antisense transcripts have also been discovered in autosomally imprinted loci, including the IGF2R/AIR locus, the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) locus, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>How these antisense elements regulate XCI and imprinting remains unsolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, various structural and functional similarities among them imply the possibility of shared mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the most interesting are the antagonistic relationship between sense and antisense loci and the initiation of antisense transcripts within imprinting centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the latest developments in antisense regulation in XCI and autosomal imprinting and speculates on molecular means by which antisense genes can regulate silencing in mammals </plain></SENT>
