<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine how two of the techniques commonly used during assisted reproduction, namely embryo culture and embryo transfer, affect <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> after implantation in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F1 hybrid mouse embryos were subjected to three experimental conditions: control (unmanipulated), embryo transfer and in-vitro-culture followed by embryo transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concepti were collected on d9.5 of development and allelic expression determination of ten imprinted genes (H19, Snrpn, Igf2, Kcnq1ot1, Cdkn1c, Kcnq1, Mknr3, Ascl2, Zim1, Peg3) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although control concepti had monoallelic imprinted gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues, both manipulated groups had aberrant expression of one or more imprinted genes in the yolk sac and placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culture further exacerbated the effects of transfer by increasing the number of genes with aberrant allelic expression in extraembryonic, as well as embryonic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, placentae of both groups of manipulated concepti exhibited reduced levels of Igf2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and increased levels of Ascl2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> when compared with their unmanipulated counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that biallelic expression of Kcnq1ot1 coincided with loss of methylation on the maternal allele of the KvDMR1 locus, a phenotype often associated with the human syndrome <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results show that even the most basic manipulation used during human-assisted reproduction, namely, embryo transfer, can lead to misexpression of several imprinted genes during post-implantation development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our results serve as a cautionary tale for gene expression studies in which embryo transfer is used </plain></SENT>
