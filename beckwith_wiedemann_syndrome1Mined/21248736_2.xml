<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BWS is a complex, multigenic disorder associated, in up to 90% of patients, with alteration in the expression or function of one or more genes in the 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are several molecular anomalies associated with BWS and the large proportion of cases, about 85%, is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the major categories of BWS molecular alteration (10-20% of cases) is represented by mosaic paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (pUPD), namely patients with two paternally derived copies of chromosome 11p15 and no maternal contribution for that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, in addition to the effects of IGF2 overexpression, a decreased level of the maternally expressed gene CDKN1C may contribute to the BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we reviewed a series of nine patients with BWS because of pUPD using several methods with the aim to evaluate the percentage of mosaicism, the methylation status at both loci, the extension of the pUPD at the short arm and the breakpoints of recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping of mitotic recombination breakpoints by single-nucleotide polymorphism-array in individuals with UPD and fine estimation of epigenetic defects will provide a basis for understanding the aetiology of BWS, allowing more accurate prognostic predictions and facilitating management and surveillance of individuals with this disorder </plain></SENT>
