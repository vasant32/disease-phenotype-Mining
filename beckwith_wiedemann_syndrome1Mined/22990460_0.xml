<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The last three decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) so that now, in developed countries, 1.7% to 4.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children are born after ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although absolute risks appear small, data from prospective and retrospective studies indicate increased risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes after ART as compared with spontaneous conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that underlying maternal factors and <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> play an important role in some of these outcomes rather than the ART procedure itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant risk of assisted conception is multiple pregnancies, but even singleton pregnancies achieved by ART are at a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, and perinatal mortality even after adjusting for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Couples undergoing ART procedures should be counseled in advance regarding increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> and higher rates of obstetric interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although conflicting data exist, studies of children born from ART suggest increased rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e>, imprinting disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>), and marginally increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the current evidence is inadequate, and prospective long-term studies are needed to eliminate the effect of confounders and draw definite conclusions about the long-term outcomes after ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absolute risk of imprinting disorders remains small, and routine screening is not recommended at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcomes after ART are difficult to evaluate because of the variability in ART methods and data reporting, and there is a need for standardized methodology for follow-up after ART </plain></SENT>
