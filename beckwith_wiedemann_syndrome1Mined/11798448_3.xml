<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to follow up the 19 infants born in Tyrol province with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo> between 1985 and 1996 whose malformation had been diagnosed prenatally, who were operated on immediately postpartum and who are alive today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: There were seven children in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> group and 12 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001543'>gastroschisis</z:hpo> group; 18 parents of affected infants took part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four out of seven children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> had major associated malformations (two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, one porencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, one with skeletal defects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These children presented handicaps related to the associated malformations but not to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three other children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> are developing normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five out of 11 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001543'>gastroschisis</z:hpo> had associated intestinal but no extraintestinal malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After discharge, ten of 11 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001543'>gastroschisis</z:hpo> were developing normally; one child shows signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 14 mothers who had originally planned another pregnancy prior to the birth of the malformed child, nine decided against becoming pregnant again; the others delayed a further pregnancy for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our group, associated malformations were the main factor affecting the long-term quality of life of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001543'>gastroschisis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although most of the children were developing normally, fear of a repetition of the malformation in a subsequent pregnancy dominated reproductive choices in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> couples </plain></SENT>
