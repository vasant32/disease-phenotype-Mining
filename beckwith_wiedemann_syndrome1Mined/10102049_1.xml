<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, our knowledge has significantly expanded as a result of the generation of experimental mouse models, engineered to disrupt the expression of one or more genes (knockout mice), and by detailed molecular and genetic analyses of infants and children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of knockout mice have largely defined the essential roles of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), insulin and their receptors in embryonic and fetal growth, and have provided compelling evidence that increased IGF-II gene expression and/or abundance can stimulate excessive fetal somatic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IGF-II gene is usually expressed only by the paternally derived allele; however, when this imprinting is erased and IGF-II expression is biallelic, fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> ensues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such increased IGF-II expression would appear to explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the information gathered from knockout mice as a guide to human studies, detailed genetic investigations are likely to unravel the mechanisms behind other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
