<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These entities include congenital craniofacial deformities with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000201'>Robin sequence</z:hpo>, Treacher Collins, Goldenhar's, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndromes</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> causing the deposit of accumulated by-products (e.g., Hurler's, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026707" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Morquio</z:e>'s, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cormack and Lehane grades 3 and 4 at laryngoscopy are an indication for advanced techniques for intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and fiberscope with a directable tip are useful and important modalities in handling difficult pediatric airway and intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMA not only offers another mode of securing airway besides face mask and tracheal intubation, but also provides a conduit for tracheal intubation and a rescue airway in the CICV (cannot intubate, cannot ventilate) situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intubation with a fiberscope can be utilized through LMA or through a specially designed face mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Face mask designed for fiberoptic intubation has a 15 mm port for connection with the breathing circuit and another 22 mm port covered with a rubber membrane through which the fiberscope is introduced and directed to the larynx and trachea followed by the tracheal tube while ventilating and anesthetizing the pediatric patients with inhalational <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Getting used to these two modalities, LMA and fiberoptic intubation of the trachea, gives a great advantage in handling of difficult pediatric airway and intubation </plain></SENT>
