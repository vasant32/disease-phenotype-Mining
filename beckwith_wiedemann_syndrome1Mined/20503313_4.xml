<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a multigenic disorder caused in most patients by alterations in growth regulatory genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small number of individuals with BWS (5-10%) have mutations in CDKN1C, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of G1 cyclin complexes that functions as a negative regulator of cellular growth and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on eight patients with BWS and CDKN1C mutations and review previous reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 72 patients (50 BWS, 17 with isolated hemihyperplasia (IH), three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>) for CDKN1C defects with the aim to search for new mutations and to define genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that BWS patients with CDKN1C mutations have a different pattern of clinical malformations than those with other molecular defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>Polydactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000078'>genital abnormalities</z:hpo>, extra nipple, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> are more frequently observed in BWS with mutations in CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical observation of these malformations may help to decide which genetic characterization should be undertaken (i.e., CDKN1C screening), thus optimizing the laboratory evaluation for BWS </plain></SENT>
