<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the rise in use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), there has been an increased awareness of potential genetic problems that may be initiated or propagated using these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several population studies have suggested a small but significantly increased risk of imprinting disorders like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, and possibly transient neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children born through ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the absolute risk appears to be very small, this association logically leads to the question of how ARTs affect gene imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies investigating culture medias, timing of embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> have not yielded an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the period of gamete development and the period during which imprinted genes must maintain methylation are vulnerable points at which errors may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further evidence linking aberrant methylation to <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> and superovulation make epigenetics and ARTs an area that requires additional research </plain></SENT>
