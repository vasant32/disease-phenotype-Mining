<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activation of the silent maternal IGF2 allele has recently been found in approximately half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> (WTs) examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process of imprint relaxation leads to biallelic expression of IGF2 and it has been suggested that this is a key event in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of some WTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it has previously been proposed that the 11p15 chromosome region contains a growth-promoting gene and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene, the simplest explanation is that increased expression of the IGF2 gene is responsible for somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in the BWS and predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model explains <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in BWS cases with unbalanced translocations with paternal dup(11p), and cases with balanced maternal translocations which are physically close to the IGF2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maternal translocations are envisaged to disrupt the maternal IGF2 imprint by a mechanism similar to the position-effect variegation mechanism in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relaxation of IGF2 imprinting has also been detected in several patients with the BWS syndrome and a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent gene disruption experiments have shown that inactivation of the mouse h19 gene leads to biallelic lgf2 expression and extensive proportional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mouse model has parallels with the BWS and WT where it has been found that biallelic IGF2 expression is accompanied by an epigenetic modification of the H19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these data it is possible to speculate that an epigenetic modification of the H19 gene may be the primary event leading to the relaxation of IGF2 imprinting </plain></SENT>
