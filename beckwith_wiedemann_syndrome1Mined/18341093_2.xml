<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is mainly characterised by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR and PNGR), asymmetry, <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> V and craniofacial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 35% of patients carry a hypomethylation of the telomeric imprinting centre region 1 (ICR1) in 11p15; single patients show a maternal duplication of 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 7-10% of patients with SRS have maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7 (mUPD7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another disorder caused by epigenetic defects is <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM) which is associated with loss of methylation (LOM) in 6q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After detecting methylation loss at multiple imprinted loci in patients with TNDM, Mackay et al. recently proposed the existence of a maternal hypomethylation syndrome presenting as TNDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They therefore concluded that patients with other disorders associated with LOM at one (maternally) methylated locus might also carry LOM at multiple loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar observations have also been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS): nearly 25% of patients displayed abnormal methylation patterns of ICRs additional to those in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To show whether general hypomethylation is a common phenomenon in imprinting disorders we carried out methylation analyses for the imprinted regions 14q32, 6q24 and the centromeric imprinting region <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> on 11p15 for 10 patients with SRS carrying mUPD7 and 22 patients with LOM at the telomeric imprinting region ICR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed that further epigenetic defects did not occur in the groups of SRS with LOM of ICR1 or mUPD7, and that these subentities do not belong to the diseases with a general hypomethylation defect, such as TNDM and BWS </plain></SENT>
