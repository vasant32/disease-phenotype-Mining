<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several pedigrees have been reported strongly suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> and an excess of transmitting females was noticed in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this excess using 19 published pedigrees and showed that this excess was for two reasons: first, reduced fecundity in affected males compared to females in a ratio of 1:4.6, and, second, a smaller risk of being affected in a ratio of 1:3 for subjects having inherited the gene from their father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These latter findings suggest <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, considering these results together with other observations, such as the parental origin of the 15p15.5 duplication and the existence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, we propose that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in BWS patients and malignant proliferation in associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> reflect an imbalance between paternal and maternal alleles </plain></SENT>
