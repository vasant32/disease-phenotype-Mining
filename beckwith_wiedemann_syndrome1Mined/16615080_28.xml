<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 11p15 comprises two imprinted domains important in the control of fetal and postnatal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel studies establish that imprinting at one of these, the IGF2-H19 domain, is epigenetically deregulated (with loss of DNA methylation) in Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, the exact opposite epigenetic alteration (gain of DNA methylation) had been detected at the domain's 'imprinting control region' (ICR) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a complex disorder of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, more frequently, BWS is caused by loss of DNA methylation at the ICR that regulates the second imprinted domain at 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar epigenetic alteration (with loss of methylation) at a putative ICR on human chromosome 6q24, is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and a transient lack of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, fetal and postnatal growth is epigenetically controlled by different ICRs, at 11p15 and other chromosomal regions </plain></SENT>
