<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glypicans are a family of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> that are linked to the cell surface through a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One member of this family, glypican-3 (Gpc3), is mutated in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e> (SGBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients display pre- and postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and a varying range of dysmorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of SGBS are very similar to the more extensively studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since BWS has been associated with biallelic expression of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), it has been proposed that GPC3 is a negative regulator of IGF-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there is still no biochemical evidence indicating that GPC3 plays such a role.Here, we report that GPC3-deficient mice exhibit several of the clinical features observed in SGBS patients, including developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cystic and dyplastic kidneys, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001176'>abnormal lung development</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A proportion of the mutant mice also display <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo> and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001144'>imperforate vagina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the particular case of the kidney, we demonstrate that there is an early and persistent developmental abnormality of the ureteric bud/collecting system due to increased proliferation of cells in this tissue element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the GPC3-deficient mice is similar to that of mice deficient in IGF receptor type 2 (IGF2R), a well characterized negative regulator of IGF-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike the IGF2R-deficient mice, however, the levels of IGF-II in GPC3 knockouts are similar to those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> littermates </plain></SENT>
