<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations include translocations, duplications, single gene mutations of p57KIP2, and increased expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The crucial defect in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes is likely to be an imbalance in contributions of growth-promoting genes versus growth-inhibitory genes in critical tissues at specific developmental stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Murine models have been used to study the effects of targeted deletions of the genes p57KIP2 and GPC3, as well as overexpression of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time, there are still many issues which remain to be explored before we can fully understand the molecular basis of BWS and SGBS </plain></SENT>
