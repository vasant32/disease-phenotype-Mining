<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether ZFP57 alterations were a genetic cause of the hypomethylation at KCNQ1OT1 DMR in patients with BWS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified three novel, presumably benign sequence variants in ZFP57; thus, we found no evidence for ZFP57 alterations as a major cause in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases </plain></SENT>
