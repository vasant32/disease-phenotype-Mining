<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple mouse models with deficiency of Cdkn1c recapitulate some aspects of BWS but do not exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the newborn, a cardinal feature of patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that Cdkn1c mutants attained a 20% increase in weight during gestation but experienced a rapid reversal of this positive growth trajectory very late in gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a marked effect on placental development concurrently with this loss of growth potential, with the appearance of large thrombotic lesions in the labyrinth zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trilaminar trophoblast layer that separates the maternal blood sinusoids from fetal capillaries was disordered with a loss of sinusoidal giant cells, suggesting a role for Cdkn1c in maintaining the integrity of the maternal-fetal interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of mutant pups decreased in the face of increasing intrauterine competition, identifying a role for Cdkn1c in the allocation of the maternal resources via the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work explains one difficulty in precisely replicating BWS in this animal model: the differences in reproductive strategies between the multiparous mouse, in which intrauterine competition is high, and humans, in which singleton pregnancies are more common </plain></SENT>
