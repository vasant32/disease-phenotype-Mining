<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paternally derived and maternally derived 11p15.5 duplications represent infrequent findings in BWS and SRS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a case in which a 6.5 Mb duplication of 11p15.4-pter resulted in SRS and BWS phenotypes in a child and her mother, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analyses demonstrated that the duplication involved the maternal chromosome 11p15 in the child and the paternal chromosome 11p15 in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation provides a direct demonstration that SRS and BWS represent specular images, both at the clinical and molecular levels </plain></SENT>
