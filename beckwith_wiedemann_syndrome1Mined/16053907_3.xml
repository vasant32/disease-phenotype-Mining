<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on an infant who had been prenatally diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Klinefelter syndrome</z:e> associated with a "de novo" pericentric inversion of the Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A re-evaluation at 3 years of age suggested that he was also affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was repeated and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for 11p15.5--&gt;11pter and a distal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 18q (18q23--&gt;qter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parental cytogenetic studies showed that the father carried a balanced cryptic translocation between chromosomes 11p and 18q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the child had an extra X chromosome and a "de novo" structural abnormality of chromosome Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, his karyotype was 47,XX, inv (Y) (p11.2 q11.23), der(18) t (11;18) (p15.5;q23) pat. ish der(18) (D11S2071+, D18S1390-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two markers on the X chromosome showed that the extra X of the child was paternally inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No deletions were observed on the structurally abnormal Y chromosome from any of the microsatellites studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings of patients with BWS due to partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11p reveal that there is a distinct pattern of dysmorphic features associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> when comparing patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This fact reinforces that FISH study have to be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BWS patients, specially in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> since small rearrangements cannot be detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
