<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An infant with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, diffuse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_499'>nesidioblastosis</z:mpath>, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartoma</z:hpo> of the liver (MHL), in addition to demonstrating clinical, pathologic, and molecular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), is the subject of this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>H19 methylation assay and allelic expression analysis for insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) indicated that the patient was mosaic for paternal isodisomic cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells in lung tissue, nontumoral liver tissue, tissue from the MHL, and pancreatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose that abundant IGF2 expression during development due to paternal isodisomy resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and islet cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, which led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_499'>nesidioblastosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MHL, by contrast, may have resulted from a decrease in disomic cells, compared with nontumoral liver tissue, which showed an increase in disomic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> may result in unbalanced tissue growth, which may contribute to the formation of MHL in BWS </plain></SENT>
