<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumours</z:e> occur in otherwise healthy children, but a small proportion occur in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> associated with increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> has become widespread, despite a lack of clarity about which children are at increased risk of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and limited evidence of the efficacy of screening or guidance as to how screening should be implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The available literature was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The potential risks and benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> surveillance are finely balanced and there is no clear evidence that screening reduces mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective evidence-based data on the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> screening would be difficult and costly to generate and are unlikely to become available in the foreseeable future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The following pragmatic recommendations have been formulated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> surveillance in children at risk, based on our review: (1) Surveillance should be offered to children at &gt;5% risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Surveillance should only be offered after review by a clinical geneticist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Surveillance should be carried out by renal ultrasonography every 3-4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) Surveillance should continue until 5 years of age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions except <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e> and some familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> pedigrees where it should continue until 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(5) Surveillance can be undertaken at a local centre, but should be carried out by someone with experience in paediatric ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(6) Screen-detected lesions should be managed at a specialist centre </plain></SENT>
