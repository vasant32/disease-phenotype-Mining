<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> malformation syndrome characterised by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR, PGR) and dysmorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic causes are unknown, however in approximately 10% of patients a maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 7 or chromosomal aberrations can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four growth retarded children, two with SRS-like features, associated with maternal duplications of 11p15 have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering the involvement of this genomic region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome (BWS), we postulated that some cases of SRS--with an opposite phenotype to BWS--might also be caused by genomic disturbances in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 46 SRS patients were screened for genomic rearrangements in 11p15 by STR typing and FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two SRS patients with duplications of maternal 11p material in our study population (n = 46) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patient SR46, the duplicated region covered at least 9 Mb; FISH analysis revealed a translocation of 11p15 onto 10q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patient SR90, additional 11p15 material (approximately 5 Mb) was translocated to the short arm of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that diagnostic testing for duplication in 11p15 should be offered to patients with severe IUGR and PGR with clinical signs reminiscent of SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SRS is a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition and patients with a maternal duplication of 11p15.5 may form an important subgroup </plain></SENT>
