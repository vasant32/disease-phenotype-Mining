<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought to be a complex disorder in which multiple genes are implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>Cryptorchidism</z:hpo> and reduced fecundity are symptoms in male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> patients and the ZNF214 and ZNF215 genes, localized on chromosomal region 11p15, are associated with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the ZNF214 and ZNF215 genes, which are predominantly expressed in the testis, could be involved in male factor <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0008669'>impaired spermatogenesis</z:hpo> or in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008669'>impaired spermatogenesis</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male partners of <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertile</z:mp> couples with idiopathic azoo- or severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002687'>oligozoospermia</z:mp>, male partners with azoo- or severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002687'>oligozoospermia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> in their medical history and men with normozoospermia were screened for nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ZNF214 and ZNF215 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An association study was performed based on allele and estimated haplotype frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences in allele frequencies and in estimated haplotype frequencies were found in both patient groups compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, both genes were screened for mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aberrant patterns were confirmed by DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis in ZNF214 and ZNF215 revealed five new variants in the patients that were not present in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At least three of these mutations were inherited from the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that chromosomal region 11p15 is associated with male factor <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0008669'>impaired spermatogenesis</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
