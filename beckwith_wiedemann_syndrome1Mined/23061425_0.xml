<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) as the consequence of an apparently balanced, maternally inherited reciprocal translocation t(11;17)(p15.5;q21.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His mother and aunt, who inherited the translocation from their father, did not have BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At birth, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> was diagnosed in this child and, secondarily, among apparently healthy family members carrying the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By FISH analysis, the breakpoint in 11p15.5 interrupts the KCNQ1 gene between exons 2 and 10 and causes a loss of methylation of the IC2 (and thus BWS) on the maternally inherited der(11) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explain the presence of LQTS segregating with the t(11;17) translocation in this family, we hypothesize that the translocation that interrupts KCNQ1 allow translation of an abnormal short allele that interferes in a dominant negative way with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> isoform 1 of KCNQ1 in the heart (where this allele is not subject to parental imprint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This appears to be the first report of BWS with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, which should be considered as a rare but serious complication to be searched systematically in patients with BWS due to 11p15 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
