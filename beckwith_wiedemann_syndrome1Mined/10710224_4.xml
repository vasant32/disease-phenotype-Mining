<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data on 19 affected individuals and their first-degree relatives indicate that the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> rather than the age of subjects may be responsible for the highly variable <z:mp ids='MP_0005382'>craniofacial phenotype</z:mp> found in individuals diagnosed with WBS </plain></SENT>
