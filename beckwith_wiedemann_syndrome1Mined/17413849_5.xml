<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes comprise a small subset of the genome whose epigenetic reprogramming in the germ line is necessary for subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reprogramming and resetting of the imprints, through an erasure/acquisition/maintenance cycle, is a subtle and tightly orchestrated phenomenon, involving specific genomic regions and methylation enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of imprinted genes has indeed been shown to lead to several human disorders as well as to affect placental and fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been numerous and conflicting studies assessing the possible association of imprinting disorders with assisted reproductive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work analyzes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant and available reports with regard to the association between assisted reproductive techniques and imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also discusses whether this possibly increased risk of imprinting disorders may be linked to specific steps of these reproductive techniques or already present in the gametes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in the germ line is absolutely necessary both to assess the safety of these methods and of the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008669'>impaired spermatogenesis</z:hpo> gametes for assisted reproduction </plain></SENT>
