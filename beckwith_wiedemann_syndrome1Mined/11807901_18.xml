<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe three unrelated cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of them were diagnosed postnatally while the third was detected during pregnancy that resulted in elective termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amniotic karyotypes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of polymorphic loci mapping to 11p15.5 region documented partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 11p15.5 due to paternal translocation in one, and segmental and mosaic segmental unipaternal disomy (UPD) in the second and third cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on findings documented in these cases and the literature, we tabulated the anomalies that might be detected prenatally by ultrasound and that may suggest the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constant findings included fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, polyhydramios, <z:mp ids='MP_0004260'>enlarged placenta</z:mp>, and specifically a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>distended abdomen</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As most described signs developed after 22 weeks of gestation, a careful follow-up should be carried on until late stages of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An amniotic karyotype might not detect subtle chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore recommend utilizing PCR of polymorphic loci on 11p15.5, in addition to conventional cytogenetic analysis of the fetus and both parents to detect possible maternal deletions or inversions, paternal duplications, and UPD that may account for the largest subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> WBS reaching 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An early diagnosis of WBS is important for counseling the parents concerning potential risk for developing embryonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, selection of the mode of delivery due to potential adrenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> that might bleed during labor, and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
