<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The parent-of-origin-dependent expression of IGF2 and H19 is controlled by the imprinting center 1 (IC1) consisting of a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IC1 is normally methylated on the paternal chromosome and nonmethylated on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that 22 cases in a large cohort of patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) had IC1 methylated on both parental chromosomes, resulting in biallelic activation of IGF2 and biallelic silencing of H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These individuals had marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> and high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of these patients had 1.4- to 1.8-kb deletions with hypermethylation of the remaining IC1 region and fully penetrant BWS phenotype when transmitted maternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another subset of individuals with IC1 hypermethylation had a similar clinical phenotype but no mutation in the local vicinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and in at least two families affected and unaffected members shared the same maternal IC1 allele but not the abnormal maternal epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no IC1 deletion was detected in 10 nonsyndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> with IC1 hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, methylation defects at the IGF2-H19 locus can result from inherited mutations of the imprinting center and have high recurrence risk or arise independently from the sequence context and not transmitted to the progeny </plain></SENT>
