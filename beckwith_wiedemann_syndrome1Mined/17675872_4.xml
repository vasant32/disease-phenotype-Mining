<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal effects for sexual maturity, egg production, egg quality traits and viability are well known in poultry crosses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been used in an optimal way to form profitable production hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These effects have been hypothesized to originate from sex-linked genes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003718'>maternal effects</z:mp> or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these may not be the only explanations for reciprocal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) has revealed autosomal areas with parent-of-origin specific effects in the chicken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mammals, parental imprinting, i.e. the specifically regulated expression of either maternal or paternal allele in the offspring, is the main cause of such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most commonly accepted hypothesis for the origin of imprinting, the conflict hypothesis, assumes a genetic conflict of interest between the maternal and paternal genomes regarding the allocation of resources to the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also intrinsically implies that imprinting should not occur in oviparous taxa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, new molecular genetic information has raised a need to review the possible involvement of imprinting or some related phenomena as a putative cause of reciprocal effects in poultry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparative mapping provides strong evidence for the conservation of orthologous imprinted gene clusters on chicken macrochromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these gene clusters exhibit asynchronous DNA replication, an epigenetic mark specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imprinted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that these intrinsic chromosomal properties have been important for the evolution of imprinted gene expression in the mammalian lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many of the mapped parent-of-origin specific QTL effects in chicken locate in or close to these conserved regions that show some of the basic features involved in monoallelic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If monoallelic expression in these regions would be observed in birds, the actual mechanism and cause may be different from the imprinting that evolved later in the mammalian lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this review we discuss recent molecular genetic results that may provide tools for understanding of reciprocal differences in poultry breeding and the evolution of imprinting </plain></SENT>
