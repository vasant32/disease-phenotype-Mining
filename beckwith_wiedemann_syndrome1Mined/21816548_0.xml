<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100028'>Ectopic thyroid</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> are the most frequent thyroid structural malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several reports have shown that CH is associated with birth defects (BD) ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> to ocular and gastrointestinal anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We investigated how many and what types of BD were associated with CH in Mexican children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted in patients with confirmed CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Highly specialized government pediatric center in Mexico City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: We included 212 patients with permanent CH identified by newborn screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 24% of patients with CH also had BD, and that there was a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008191'>thyroid agenesis</z:hpo> in the group of patients with CH associated with BD (CH+BD) versus the isolated CH group (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were more females than males in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common BD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo>, especially those of the atrial septum, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo>, found as a single malformation or as part of a complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found <z:hpo ids='HP_0002251'>Hirschsprung disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000201'>Pierre Robin sequence</z:hpo>, Albright's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteodystrophy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220708" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">VATER association</z:e>, and frontonasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, there was a high prevalence of BD in patients with permanent CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008191'>Thyroid agenesis</z:hpo> was the main etiological cause of CH in patients with associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of CH+BD underlines the need for a comprehensive clinical diagnostic approach of the patients with CH </plain></SENT>
