<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions, including an essential developmental role in the reprogramming of germ cells and early embryos, the repression of endogenous retrotransposons, and a generalized role in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special functions of DNA methylation include the marking of one of the parental alleles of many imprinted genes, a group of genes essential for growth and development in mammals with a unique parent-of-origin expression pattern, a role in stabilizing X-chromosome inactivation, and centromere function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it is not surprising that errors in establishing or maintaining patterns of methylation are associated with a diverse group of human diseases and syndromes </plain></SENT>
