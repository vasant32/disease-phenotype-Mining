<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular defects are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> but most of the cases are associated with defective DNA methylation at either one of two Imprinting Control Regions (IC1 and IC2) or Uniparental paternal Disomy (UPD) at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rare cases, the BWS phenotype has been found associated with maternal transmission of IC1 microdeletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a family with a novel 1.8 kb deletion that is associated with hypermethylation at IC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation results from recombination between highly homologous sequences containing target sites for the zinc-finger protein CTCF (CTSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the hypothesis that the function of IC1 and the penetrance of the clinical phenotype depend on the spacing of the CTSs resulting from recombination in the mutant allele </plain></SENT>
