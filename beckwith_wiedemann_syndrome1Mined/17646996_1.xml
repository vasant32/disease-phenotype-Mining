<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the IVC ligations reported in the literature have been in the context of trauma damage control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are only anecdotal reports in the literature of a successful elective ligation of the IVC in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Records from a paediatric tertiary care centre were reviewed over a 20-year period to identify and evaluate patients who underwent an intentional ligation of the IVC during elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reports from the literature of IVC ligations were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The physiologic and anatomic basis for the sequelae of IVC ligation was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intentional ligation of the IVC was done in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apart from pedal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> lasting for 1 and 9 months, respectively, in two of them, none of these patients had any long-term sequelae related to the ligation of their IVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adequate collaterals providing satisfactory drainage were demonstrated by Doppler studies postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that during surgery, when other options are absent, the IVC can be safely ligated in children, providing a therapeutic benefit to the patient </plain></SENT>
