<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation syndromes</z:e> had long remained obscure, because their biochemical bases were unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, with recently developed reverse-genetic and/or Human Genome Project-derived technology, we have been able to approach such disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These new methods include positional cloning techniques, candidate gene approach and positional candidate strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, positional cloning has become most reliable nowadays, and three ways are mainly available to obtain position information of disease genes, i.e., data from linkage analysis of disease families; comparative maps between different species; breakpoints of disease-related de novo chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I present here some examples for each strategy: a large kindred with mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> Kantaputra type for linkage data, and its seemingly allelic bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with t (2; 8) for positional cloning that starts from a chromosomal translocation; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Waardenburg syndrome</z:e> for candidate gene approach; and the p57KIP2 gene for positional candidate approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I finally emphasize that a human link composed of general physicians, molecular geneticists and clinical researchers is essential to reach a goal of reverse genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without such a goal, we can neither understand the genesis of diseases nor develop their therapy </plain></SENT>
