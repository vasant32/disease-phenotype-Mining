<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, patients with BWS have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> are usually attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or chromosome abnormalities involving copy number variation for genes beyond the critical BWS region at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain abnormalities have not previously been recognized within the BWS phenotypic spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report on seven cases of BWS associated with posterior fossa abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, two cases presented with Blake's pouch <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, two with Dandy-Walker variant (DWV; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the inferior part of the vermis), one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001305'>Dandy-Walker malformation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DWM</z:e>) and one with a complex of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DWM</z:e>, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and brain stem abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, molecular findings involved the centromeric imprinted domain on chromosome locus 11p15.5, which includes imprinting center 2 (IC2) and the imprinted growth suppressor gene, CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases had loss of methylation at IC2, two had CDKN1C mutations, and one had loss of methylation at IC2 and a microdeletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one case no mutation/methylation abnormality was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings together with previously reported correlations suggest that genes in imprinted domain 2 at 11p15.5 are involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> midline development of several organs including the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that brain malformations may present as a finding within the BWS phenotype when the molecular etiology involves imprinted domain 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging may be useful in identifying such malformations in individuals with BWS and neurodevelopmental issues </plain></SENT>
