<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternally inherited mutations in the imprinted CDKN1C gene are known to be associated with WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a novel mutation in several members of a large family affected by WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation is a G --&gt; T change in a run of seven G's near the 5' splice site of intron 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> obligate carriers and affected individuals carry the mutation, and in each affected case, the allele was inherited maternally, strongly suggesting a role in causing WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation is located in a poly-G tract in the intron; intronic G-rich sequences in other genes have been shown to have a role in promoting splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In transfected 293HEK cells, we found that the G --&gt; T mutation reduced splicing efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven G's in the poly-G tract further reduced splicing efficiency, supporting a role for the G-tract as a splicing enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fibroblasts of one affected patient showed a similar reduction in splicing efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maternal monoallelic expression of CDKN1C was verified in this patient cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the total amount of spliced message was not reduced by the mutation in spite of the reduced efficiency of splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We discuss the possible role of the splicing defect in the pathogenesis of WBS in this pedigree </plain></SENT>
