<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gray-scale echographic characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation with pathologic characteristics, clinical presentation, prognosis, and therapy response was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two echographic patterns emerged: (a) hypoechoic solid--3; and (b) hyperechoic solid--21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Necrotic degeneration as well as decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size were echographic features correlated with positive response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis showed no initial correlation between the echographic patterns and the clinical presentation or prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the echographic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> seem distinctive enough to help in etiologic differentiation and therapy management </plain></SENT>
