<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Opposite epigenetic and genomic disturbances in this chromosomal region contribute to two distinct imprinting disorders associated with disturbed growth, Silver-Russell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the complexity of the 11p15 imprinting regions and their interactions, the interpretation of the copy number variations in that region is complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome in case of microduplications or microdeletions is therefore influenced by the size, the breakpoint positions and the parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the imbalance as well as by the imprinting status of the affected genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on their own new cases and those from the literature, the authors give an overview on the genotype-phenotype correlation in chromosomal rearrangements in 11p15 as the basis for a directed genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detailed characterisation of patients and families helps to further delineate risk figures for syndromes associated with 11p15 disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these cases provide us with profound insights in the complex regulation of the (imprinted) factors localised in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
