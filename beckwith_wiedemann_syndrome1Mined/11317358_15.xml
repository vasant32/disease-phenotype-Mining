<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new procedure for the analysis of the methlyation status of imprinted genes based on methylation-specific PCR followed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (MSP/DHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method offers a rapid and very reliable alternative to conventional methods used for such purposes such as Southern blots and methylation specific PCR (allele-specific MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficient resolution of the differentially methylated alleles is demonstrated for two human imprinted genes, namely the SNRPN gene and the LIT1 gene (KCNQ1OT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003787'>Abnormal imprinting</z:mp> of the two genes is associated with the Angelman/Prader-Willi syndromes and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MSP/DHPLC method is based on PCR amplification of gene segments which show parent-of-origin specific methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA is subjected to an in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment prior to PCR amplifications using primers specific for modified DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both alleles are theoretically amplified with equal efficiency and are represented by identically sized PCR products; they differ, however, at a number of positions within the amplified DNA segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DHPLC analysis allows a very efficient resolution of the two populations of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high sensitivity and quantitative properties of the MSP/DHPLC method are illustrated based on its ability to reveal a low cell mosaicism in an infant with a maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> 15 (i.e., Prader-Willi syndrome patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The minor cell line (approximately 8% in blood) was not detectable with conventional molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While the detection of low cell mosaicisms of structurally abnormal chromosomes usually relies on cytogenetic studies, the MSP/DHPLC method described here not only offers an alternative at the molecular level, but may also reveal mosaicisms concerning structurally intact chromosomes </plain></SENT>
