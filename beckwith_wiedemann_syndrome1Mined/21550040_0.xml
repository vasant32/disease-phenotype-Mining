<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A child with BWS born after ART to an HIV serodiscordant couple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Assisted reproductive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): ART and HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Since 2003, it has been suggested that there is an association between ART and BWS, which is a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, umbilical and abdominal wall abnormalities, and an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002898'>embryonal tumors</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is a multigenic disorder resulting from genetic or epigenetic alterations of genes on chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylation errors account for 50%-60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and almost 100% of cases born after ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We report the birth of a child diagnosed with BWS arising from an ART cycle to an HIV serodiscordant couple with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case cannot constitute conclusive evidence but it raises various questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Assisted reproductive technology seems to be in the causal pathway but a male/female factor or an iatrogenic factor is also possible </plain></SENT>
