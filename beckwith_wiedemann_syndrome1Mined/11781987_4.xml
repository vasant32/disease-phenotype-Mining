<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a congenital syndrome associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> commonly are screened with abdominal sonography resulting in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at a lower stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> have been traditionally treated with complete nephrectomy; however, smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are amenable to nephron-sparing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> may be metachronous and nonmalignant disease may compromise renal function in BWS, nephron-sparing approaches may be desirable as the first option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> underwent nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound scan were evaluated by a pediatric surgeon to assess whether partial nephrectomy would have been feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The determining criteria included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involving one third or less of the kidney and no involvement of either hilar or vascular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients underwent complete nephrectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient, who had undergone a left nephrectomy before the initiation of screening had salvage chemotherapy after biopsy results showed right kidney involvement with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nephron-sparing surgery is reasonable to consider in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> who are screened at intervals of 4 months or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative benefits of partial nephrectomy for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>-predisposing conditions only can be assessed in the setting of a cooperative clinical trial </plain></SENT>
