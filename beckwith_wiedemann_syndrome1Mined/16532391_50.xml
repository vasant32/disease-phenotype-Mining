<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of this DMR--and subsequently of the H19 promoter region--is a major cause of the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e> and/or asymmetry seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> or in isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a series of patients with hypomethylation of the H19 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their main clinical features of asymmetry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> are the opposite of those seen in patients with hypermethylation of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that complete hypomethylation of the H19 promoter is found in two of three patients with the full clinical spectrum of Silver-Russell syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This syndrome is also characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and asymmetry, among other clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with these clinical features should be analyzed for H19 hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
