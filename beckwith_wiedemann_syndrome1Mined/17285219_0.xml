<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various congenital anomalies are associated with a genetic predisposition and thus an increased risk of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a retrospective analysis, the records from 1965 to 2003 of 66 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and type of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">urogenital malformations</z:e> as well as the genetic mutations and overall survival in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient cohort comprised 66 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>: 35 male patients (53%) and 31 female patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival after 10 years was 89.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent radical nephrectomy: transperitoneal approach in 63 and lumbar approach in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (16.7%) patients had diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000119'>urogenital anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic investigation was performed in 38 patients that revealed no pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of molecular genetic testing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens were available for seven patients: a genetic mutation was detected in one case (heterozygous mutation R394 in exon 9 of the WT1 gene) which had already been described in the literature in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0950121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Denys-Drash syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">urogenital malformations</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, it would be important to carry out further molecular genetic testing to identify possible WT1 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Close interdisciplinary cooperation between urologists, specialists in human genetics, and pediatricians is imperative </plain></SENT>
