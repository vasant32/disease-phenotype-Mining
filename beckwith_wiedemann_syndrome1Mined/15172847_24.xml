<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are increasingly used to overcome <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, there is concern about the health of the children conceived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The empirical evidence for associations with outcomes related to child health is variable and should be evaluated with consideration of methodological shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is convincing evidence that ART treatment may increase the risk of a few outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental laboratory studies document that various constituents in culture media affect various embryo characteristics both positively and negatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple-gestation pregnancy and birth are increased with ART, both because of multiple embryo transfer and embryo splitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is evidence of an increase in chromosomal abnormalities among pregnancies conceived using intracytoplasmic sperm injection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> among singletons conceived with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of ART; however, there remains uncertainty about whether these risks stem from the treatment or the parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For some outcomes, data of an increased risk with ART are suggestive at best largely because of lack of purposeful study of sufficient size and scope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include specific perinatal morbidities, birth defects, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disabilities</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence for an association between ART and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> is inconsistent and weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is inconclusive evidence that ART may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions, learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disorders</z:hpo>, and reproductive effects there is insufficient empirical research to date, but given the data for more proximal outcomes, these outcomes merit further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research needs to address the unique methodological challenges underlying study in this area </plain></SENT>
