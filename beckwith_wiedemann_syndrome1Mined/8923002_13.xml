<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three genes on 11p15.5 are known to undergo <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) is normally expressed from the paternal allele, while H19 and p57KIP2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, are expressed from the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five germline balanced chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) have been mapped to 11p15.5 between p57KIP2 and IGF2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are derived from the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By positional cloning from BWS breakpoints, we have isolated a gene 100 kb and 65 kb centromeric to the proximal end of this BWS breakpoint cluster and p57KIP2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene is homologous to yeast nucleosome assembly protein (NAP1) and to a human homologue of NAP1, and we designate it hNAP2 (human nucleosome assembly protein 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hNAP2 diverges in its expression pattern from IGF2, H19, and p57KIP2, and it shows biallelic expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, hNAP2 is functionally insulated from the imprinting domain of 11p15 </plain></SENT>
