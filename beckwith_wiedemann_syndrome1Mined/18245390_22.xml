<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A variety of abnormalities have been demonstrated at chromosome 11p15 in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of these abnormalities is clinically important but often technically difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) is a simple but effective technique able to identify and differentiate methylation and copy number abnormalities, and thus is potentially well suited to the analysis of 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To customize and test an MS-MLPA assay capable of detecting and distinguishing the full spectrum of known 11p15 epigenetic and copy number abnormalities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and to assess its effectiveness as a first line investigation of these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five synthetic probe pairs were designed to extend the range of abnormalities detectable with a commercially available MS-MLPA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To define the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, 75 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control samples were analysed using the customized assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The assay was then used to analyse a "test set" of 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 27 abnormal samples, with data analysed by two independent blinded observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal samples was confirmed by a second technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MS-MLPA assay gave reproducible, accurate methylation and copy number results in the 126 samples assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The blinded observers correctly identified and classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 51 samples in the test set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MS-MLPA robustly and sensitively detects and distinguishes epigenetic and copy number abnormalities at 11p15 and is an effective first line investigation of 11p15 in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
