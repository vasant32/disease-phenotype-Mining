<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using up to 14 chromosome 11 polymorphic markers, loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) was demonstrated in both AA patients and in 4 of 6 HB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This identified three distinct and non-overlapping regions of 11p within which LOH occurred, which were defined as lying distal to the gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> locus (11p15.5), proximal to the gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> locus but distal to 11p13 (LOH being detected at 11p15.1), and restricted to the 11p13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific LOH within each 11p15 region was observed in HB, and this represents the first demonstration by a single study of LOH clearly affecting separate regions of chromosome band 11p15 in a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One AA showed LOH restricted to 11p13 loci, implicating the involvement of the WT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second AA patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000119'>genitourinary abnormalities</z:hpo> and we therefore examined sequences coding for 3 zinc finger domains of WT1 in both AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No point mutations were identified in sequence from either patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless our results indicate that 3 separate 11p loci may be significant in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> which arise in association with BWS </plain></SENT>
