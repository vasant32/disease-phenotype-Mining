<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the growth disorders that involve excessive growth, many could be attributable to overexpression of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because one copy of the IGF2 gene is silenced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, several different molecular errors can double the number of active copies of the IGF2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although not formally demonstrated, each of these errors is expected to double the level of IGF2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nature and severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> might be dependent on the number and location of cells that carry the molecular defect </plain></SENT>
