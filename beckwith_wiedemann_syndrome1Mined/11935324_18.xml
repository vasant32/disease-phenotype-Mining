<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the IGF2 ApaI single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associates with weight and body mass index in middle-aged Caucasian males but that there is no such association with the INS -23/ HphI site that marks INS 5' variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) class I vs class III VNTR alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the examination of three SNP markers in IGF2: 6815 A/T in the P1 promoter, AluI in exon 3 and ApaI in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), INS 5'VNTR class I alleles and the TH01 tetranucleotide microsatellite in a population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis has taken into account the possibility that typing failure and the number of parameters required to model multiallelic loci could create spurious significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have exercised Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests, dichotomised multiallelic series to impose parsimony, and examined the data with failures modelled or excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis infers that three markers, IGF2 ApaI, TH01 and subclasses of INS VNTR class I independently predict derived weight indices (combined P&lt;10(-8) and accounting up to 2% of population weight variance), with no evidence of interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This establishes that there must be multiple causal sites impacting on weight in this genomic region </plain></SENT>
