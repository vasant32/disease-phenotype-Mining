<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternal chromosome 11p15 loss of heterozygosity and paternal chromosome 11 isodisomy suggest that imprinted genes are involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene located at 11p15.5 has been put forward as a candidate gene as it is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed) in the mouse, and is expressed at high levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that the IGF2 gene is expressed from the paternal allele in human fetal tissue, but that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> expression can occur biallelically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that relaxation of imprinting may play a role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease and suggest a new genetic mechanism involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
