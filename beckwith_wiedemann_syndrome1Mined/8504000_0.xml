<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed renal ultrasounds in 50 healthy, appropriate for gestational age, term-babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found correlation between several anthropometric measures, but the most significant were weight and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases the left similar to others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is important to know <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal dimensions in newborns, since there are diseases that not only are associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000792'>renal malformations</z:hpo>, but also with a reduced renal size such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, or increased renal size such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
