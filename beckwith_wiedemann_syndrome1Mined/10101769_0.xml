<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We comment on the most important advances related to the phenomenon of genomic 'imprinting' in clinical paediatric neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DEVELOPMENT: Initially, we review the biological findings related to this subject and establish various concepts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Later, we attempt to clarify the different mechanisms of expression of the phenomenon 'imprinting' and its application in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We give a detailed review of the various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> in which this genetic phenomenon has been involved to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we attempt to determine when this genetic alteration should be suspected and which molecular biology techniques should be used to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis suspecting that the presence of genomic 'imprinting' may be the mechanism causing a particular pathology should be based on a family tree showing that both sexes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> generations are affected and that the severity of the same disease varies among different members of the same family; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study strategy includes studying the methylation pattern of the DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If there are changes in this, PCR should be done to show the exact pattern of the alteration </plain></SENT>
