<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The parent-of-origin phenomenon in humans is now well recognized, and the deregulation of imprinted genes has been implicated in a number of human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, several linkage analysis methods have been developed to allow for parent-of-origin effects in the analysis of pedigree data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in general, one does not know a priori if disease-causing loci are imprinted or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage methods that allow for imprinting can lose power if there is no imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, linkage methods that do not allow for imprinting will lose power if there is imprinting, because of penetrance values not being correctly specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to know whether imprinting is a possible mode of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> before performing linkage analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe a simple covariate-coding scheme to test for the presence of parent-of-origin effects, and provide a formula for calculating parent-specific penetrance values prior to any linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In simulation studies our coding scheme successfully detected parent-of-origin effects and, when pedigrees were ascertained sequentially or through a single proband, inclusion of this covariate more accurately estimated penetrance values than when such a covariate was not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of accurate penetrance values in a linkage analysis that allows for imprinting can provide higher power when the disease locus is imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we applied our approach to 27 pedigrees affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome, and found that a maternally expressed parent-of-origin model based on the likelihood ratio test was the most parsimonious, suggesting a role for paternally imprinted genes in BWS </plain></SENT>
