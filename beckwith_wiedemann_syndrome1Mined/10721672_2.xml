<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this transcript, we found a C-to-T transition, which was located between exons 10 and 11 of KVLQT1, and was confirmed by sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequency of this polymorphism, was 0.82: 0.18 in Japanese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our novel polymorphism, combined with other polymorphisms, could be very useful in helping to determine whether the imprinting of LIT1 is disrupted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) or in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
