<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises important questions about mechanistic and functional relationships between imprinted genes in a cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene is paternally expressed and is surrounded by maternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is the most common molecular defect found in the human foetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> syndrome (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transgenic experiments in the mouse establish that overexpression of IGF2 can result in most of the symptoms of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, mutations, translocations, or methylation defects in BWS have so far been found in three of the linked maternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present a model where the paternal growth enhancer IGF2 is surrounded by multiple maternal suppressors, and mutations, or epigenetic alterations, in any of these suppressors could cause BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the precise phenotypic spectrum of BWS might depend on which maternally expressed gene is mutated </plain></SENT>
