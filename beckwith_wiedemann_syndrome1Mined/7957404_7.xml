<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and a familial form have been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that duplications or rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) underlie the aetiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This region of chromosome 11 contains the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, which has been shown to be parentally imprinted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form of the BWS with only the active, paternally-derived allele being duplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The familial form of BWS, which exhibits a predominantly maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, has been suggested to result from a relaxation of IGF2 imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could render both parental IGF2 alleles active, thereby generating a similar gene dosage as in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> from of the BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we used an RNase protection assay based upon a polymorphic region within exon nine of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show here that only the paternally-inherited IGF2 allele is transcriptionally active in the index patient of one family with inherited BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, highly informative IGF2 DNA markers were used to perform linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since these data ruled out a common maternally-transmitted IGF2 allele in the affected patients, we argue that IGF2 cannot be linked to the hereditary form to the disease </plain></SENT>
