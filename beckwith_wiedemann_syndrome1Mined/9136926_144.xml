<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p57(Kip2) is a paternally imprinted gene that encodes a potent inhibitor of several cyclin/Cdk complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p57(Kip2) is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated cells, associates with G1 Cdks, and can cause cell cycle arrest in G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of p57(Kip2) in vivo, we have ablated the p57(Kip2) gene by homologous recombination in ES cells and generated mice devoid of p57(Kip2) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most p57(Kip2) null mice die after birth and display severe developmental defects with varying degrees of penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, heterozygous mice that inherit a maternal, but not a paternal, targeted allele exhibit similar deficiencies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Developmental defects of p57(Kip2) mutant mice include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and gastrointestinal abnormalities ranging from an inflated GI tract to loss of the jejunum and ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These tissues display a significant increase of apoptotic cells in the absence of p57(Kip2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most p57(Kip2) mutant mice have <z:mp ids='MP_0000547'>short limbs</z:mp>, a defect attributable to abnormal endochondral ossification caused by delayed cell cycle exit during chondrocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar defect has been observed in mice lacking p107 and p130, thus suggesting that p57(Kip2) might be an upstream regulator of these Rb-related proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p57(Kip2) locus has been implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To date, we have not observed neoplastic development even in those p57(Kip2) mutant mice that have survived for &gt;5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that p57(Kip2) has an important role during mouse development that cannot be compensated by other Cdk inhibitors </plain></SENT>
