<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the chromatin-based imprinting mechanism of the p57(KIP2)/LIT1 subdomain at chromosome 11p15.5 and the mouse ortholog at chromosome 7F5, we investigated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-modification status at a differentially CpG methylated region of Lit1/LIT1 (DMR-Lit1/LIT1), which is an imprinting control region for the subdomain and is demethylated in half of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, in both species, DMR-Lit1/LIT1 with the CpG-methylated, maternally derived inactive allele showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys9 methylation, whereas the CpG-unmethylated, paternally active allele was acetylated on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3/H4 and methylated on H3 Lys4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also investigated the relationship between CpG methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys9 methylation at DMR-LIT1 in patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual and in patients with BWS with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DMR-LIT1 methylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys9 methylation was detected on the maternal allele; however, it disappeared completely in the patients with the DMR-LIT1 imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-modification status at DMR-Lit1/LIT1 plays an important role in imprinting control within the subdomain and that loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys9 methylation, together with CpG demethylation on the maternal allele, may lead to the BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
