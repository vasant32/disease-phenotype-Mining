<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> were diagnosed during this period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our eleven cases comply with at least three of the four major criteria (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo>) and several of the minor criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interest of this paper is based on the rareness of this syndrome and its association in two of our cases with Cacchi-Ricci Syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, one of these cases later presented with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis of this syndrome in order to avoid the metabolic disturbances (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>), to establish prompt treatment of the serious anomalies (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>) and to control and follow these patients since they have increased risk to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
