<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p57(Kip2) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor belonging to the Cip/Kip family, which also includes p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, p57(Kip2) is the least-studied Cip/Kip protein, and for a long time its relevance has been related mainly to its unique role in embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, genetic and molecular studies on animal models and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> have shown that alterations in CDKN1C (the p57(Kip2) encoding gene) have functional relevance in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a number of investigations have identified and characterized heretofore unexpected roles for p57(Kip2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein appears to be critically involved in initial steps of cell and tissue differentiation, and particularly in neuronal development and erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, p27(Kip1), the Cip/Kip member that is most homologous to p57(Kip2), is primarily involved in the process of cell cycle exit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p57(Kip2) also plays a critical role in controlling cytoskeletal organization and cell migration through its interaction with LIMK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p57(Kip2) appears to modulate genome expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, accumulating evidence indicates that p57(Kip2) protein is frequently downregulated in different types of human epithelial and nonepithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> as a consequence of genetic and epigenetic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the emerging picture is that several aspects of p57(Kip2)'s functions are only poorly clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review represents an appraisal of the data available on the p57(Kip2) gene and protein structure, and its role in human <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We particularly focus our attention on p57(Kip2) changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and pharmacological approaches for modulating p57(Kip2) levels </plain></SENT>
