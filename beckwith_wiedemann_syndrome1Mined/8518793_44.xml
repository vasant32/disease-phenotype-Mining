<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To define the region of 11p15 involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), we have carried out a molecular genetic analysis of six patients with features of BWS and constitutional cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome band 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis confirmed the 11p origin of the duplicated material and defined the smallest region of overlap for such duplications, within which a gene involved in BWS must be located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This region encompasses the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene complex (HBB) to 11pter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both of our informative cases, the 11p duplication was found to be of paternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two BWS associated balanced translocations of 11p15 were studied to localize the breakpoints on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Somatic cell hybrids, Southern blotting and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that both breakpoints were between D11S12 and the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A non-BWS translocation breakpoint was more proximal, between HBB and calcitonin-A (CALCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis showed that both BWS associated 11p15 translocations were transmitted by phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data are compatible with the hypothesis that the BWS gene is imprinted and that the maternally inherited BWS gene is normally suppressed whereas the paternally inherited allele is active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, duplications of paternal origin would lead to increased dosage of the BWS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly increased dosage of the BWS gene could account for the findings in maternally inherited 11p15 translocations by altering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting, so that the translocated maternal allele remains active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study defines one or more gene loci for BWS on 11p15.5 in the genomic region from D11S12 to IGF2 </plain></SENT>
