<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fetal growth is a complex process depending on the genetics of the fetus, the availability of nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, maternal nutrition and various growth factors and hormones of maternal, fetal and placental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hormones play a central role in regulating fetal growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They act as maturational and nutritional signals in utero and control tissue development and differentiation according to the prevailing environmental conditions in the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, and IGF-I and IGF-II in particular, plays a critical role in fetal and placental growth throughout gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the IGF1, IGF2 or IGF1R gene retards fetal growth, whereas disruption of IGF2R or overexpression of IGF2 enhances fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGF-I stimulates fetal growth when nutrients are available, thereby ensuring that fetal growth is appropriate for the nutrient supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The production of IGF-I is particularly sensitive to undernutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF-II plays a key role in placental growth and nutrient transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several key hormone genes involved in embryonic and fetal growth are imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disruption of this imprinting causes disorders involving growth defects, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, which is associated with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, or Silver-Russell syndrome, which is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Optimal fetal growth is essential for perinatal survival and has long-term consequences extending into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and the high risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications in later life, further clinical and basic research is needed to develop accurate early diagnosis of aberrant fetal growth and novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
