<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assisted reproductive technology includes the isolation, handling and culture of gametes and early embryos at times when imprinted genes are likely to be particularly vulnerable to external influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of sex-specific differences in imprint acquisition suggests that male and female germ cells may be susceptible to perturbations in imprinted genes at specific prenatal and postnatal stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprints acquired first during gametogenesis must be maintained during preimplantation development when reprogramming of the overall genome occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will discuss both new developments in our understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> including the mechanisms and timing of imprint erasure, acquisition and maintenance during germ cell development and early embryogenesis as well as the implications of this research for future epigenetic studies in reproduction and assisted reproductive technology </plain></SENT>
