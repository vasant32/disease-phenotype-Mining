<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most BWS cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) or putative imprinting errors predominate in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases with putative imprinting defects may be subdivided into (a) those with loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 and H19 hypermethylation and silencing due to a defect in a distal 11p15.5 imprinting control element (IC1) and (b) those with loss of methylation at KvDMR1, LOI of KCNQ1OT1 (LIT1) and variable LOI of IGF2 in whom there is a defect at a more proximal imprinting control element (IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated genotype/epigenotype-phenotype correlations in 200 cases with a confirmed molecular genetic diagnosis of BWS (16 with CDKN1C mutations, 116 with imprinting centre 2 defects, 14 with imprinting centre 1 defects and 54 with UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>Hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> was strongly associated with UPD (P&lt;0.0001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> was associated with an IC2 defect or CDKN1C mutation but not UPD or IC1 defect (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When comparing birth weight centile, IC1 defect cases were significantly heavier than the patients with CDKN1C mutations or IC2 defect (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in UPD and IC1 defect cases than in IC2 defect and CDKN1C mutation cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of 9% at age 5 years, but 24% in the UPD subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> in the IC2 defect subgroup appears to be minimal and intensive screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> appears not to be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In UPD patients, UPD extending to WT1 was associated with renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (P=0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that BWS represents a spectrum of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of the molecular subtype allows more accurate prognostic predictions and enhances the management and surveillance of BWS children such that screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> can be focused on those at highest risk </plain></SENT>
