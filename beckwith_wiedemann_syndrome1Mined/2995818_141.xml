<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both types show rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The germ line of children with the rare inherited triad of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, genito-urinary abnormality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> carry a chromosome 11 that has a deletion in its short arm (band 11p13) and these children are at increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neonates with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, in which there may be duplication of the 11p13-11p15 region, are similarly predisposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneous form of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> a deletion of the 11p14 band in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, has been reported, and the development of homozygosity for recessive mutations in the 11p region is implicated in the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of these chromosomal rearrangements and because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> is histologically indistinguishable from the early stages of kidney development, we have now examined the expression of genes localized to 11p in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> and human embryonic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> examined, the expression of the gene coding for insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), localized to the 11p15 region, was markedly increased relative to adult tissues, but was comparable to the level of expression in several fetal tissues including kidney, liver, adrenals and striated muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may reflect the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation, but could also contribute to the malignant process, as IGF-II is an embryonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
