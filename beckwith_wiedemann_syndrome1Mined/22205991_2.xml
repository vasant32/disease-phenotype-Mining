<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a three generation family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) in whom we have identified a 330 kb deletion within the KCNQ1 locus, encompassing the 11p15.5 Imprinting Centre II (IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletion arose on the paternal chromosome in the first generation and was only associated with BWS when transmitted maternally to subsequent generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletion on the maternal chromosome was associated with a lower median level of CDKN1C expression in the peripheral blood of affected individuals when compared to a cohort of unaffected controls (p&lt;0.05), however was not significantly different to the expression levels in BWS cases with loss of methylation (LOM) within IC2 (p&lt;0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover the individual with a deletion on the paternal chromosome did not show evidence of elevated CDKN1C expression or features of Russell Silver syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations support a model invoking the deletion of enhancer elements required for CDKN1C expression lying within or close to the imprinting centre and importantly extend and validate a single observation from an earlier study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 94 cases with IC2 loss of methylation revealed that KCNQ1 deletion is a rare cause of loss of maternal methylation, occurring in only 3% of cases, or in 1.5% of BWS overall </plain></SENT>
