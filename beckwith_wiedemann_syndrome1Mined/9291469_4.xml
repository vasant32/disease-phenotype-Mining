<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that overexpression of IGF2 is responsible for the increased growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> predisposition in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Association of increased levels of IGFII with increased growth is also incorporated in a current model for the evolution of Igf2 imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different experimental approaches to increasing IGFII levels in the mouse have yielded different results with respect to its effects on growth, viability, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the consequences of IGf2 overexpression in the embryonic period, without alterations in the activity of other genes, we produced transgenic mice that express the Igf2 gene under the control of the H19 enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transgene expression in the embryonic period had no significant effect on the overall size of the embryos, but was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002081'>perinatal lethality</z:mp> in homozygous, and some heterozygous, mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of homozygous mice also developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that overexpression of Igf2 can have an adverse effect on viability in the absence of a pronounced effect on overall body growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the view that growth and perinatal viability are affected differently by Igf2 overexpression in endodermal and mesodermal tissues </plain></SENT>
