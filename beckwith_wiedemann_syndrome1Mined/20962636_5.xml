<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize current evidence in the association of imprinting disorders and assisted reproductive technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: The worldwide usage of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has continued to increase since the first successful birth of a human after IVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 2002, several reports have raised concerns that children conceived by ART are at increased risk of having imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of published studies have examined DNA methylation in children conceived by ART, but results are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are the most extensively studied imprinting disorders and multiple case series and reports have been published on ART-conceived children with these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall the majority of reports suggest that ART might be associated with Beckwith-Wiedermann syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, but larger collaborative studies need to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The current data suggest an association between imprinting disorders and ART although the absolute risk appears to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, animal studies have established biologic plausibility and there is continuing concern about the possibility of epigenetic changes resulting from ART </plain></SENT>
