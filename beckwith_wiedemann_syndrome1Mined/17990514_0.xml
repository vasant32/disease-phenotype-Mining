<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, the current methods of reproductive medicine are considered safe and do not significantly increase the frequency of birth of children with diseases or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the evidence has been accumulating in literature on higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>) as a result of using assisted reproductive technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases examined, the appearance of these syndromes was explained by defective methylation status of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that manipulations with gametes and embryos during the period of total epigenetic modification of their genomes may act as potential risk factors of assisted reproductive technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overcoming many natural reproductive barriers may contribute to the development of some pathological phenotypes </plain></SENT>
