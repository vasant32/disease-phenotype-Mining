<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening was employed infrequently in the management of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>, with only 25% (6/24) of those whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> was identified more than 30 days prior to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> undergoing such examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> were evaluated regularly for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were more stage 1 tumors identified in patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was detected only through radiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of routine radiographic screening needs to be carefully evaluated in a homogeneous group of patients such as those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> using a prospective study design to determine if such screening improves the survival rate of children with this rapidly growing, but readily treatable form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
