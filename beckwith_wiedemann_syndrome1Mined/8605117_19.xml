<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are at least three loci involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> (WT) <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>: WT1 in 11p13, WT2 in 11p15.5, and WT3, as yet unmapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A compilation of cytogenetic data published for 107 WT revealed that deletion of chromosome 16 and duplication of chromosome 12 occur as frequently as the well-documented 11p deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic imbalance for chromosomes 16 and 12 was investigated in a series of 28 WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By use of a large panel of restriction fragment length polymorphisms and (CA)n probes, we demonstrated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 16q in seven (25%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The whole length of 16q was involved in six of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, consistent with a previous report of 16q13 LOH in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> WT and a constitutional breakpoint with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> patient, we map a region of particular interest to between D16S308 and D16S320 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The assumption that 16q LOH may be an early event was based on: 1) the detection of 16q LOH in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008643'>nephroblastomatosis</z:hpo>; 2) the presence of a complete (clonal) 16q LOH in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with partial (mosaic) 11p LOH; and 3) 16q LOH as the sole abnormality in one WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By quantification of chromosome 12 allelic imbalance, we detected duplication in 18% of the total series and in 25% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> unilateral cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The common region extended from the centromere to D12S7 in 12q21.1-q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also suggest that the various pathogenetically important loci are not equally involved in the different forms of WT and that their sequential involvement may differ </plain></SENT>
