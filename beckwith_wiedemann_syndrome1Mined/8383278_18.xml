<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper represents a synthesis of the current state of knowledge regarding recognizable phenotypes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific disorders discussed include the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, which has been localized to 11p15.5; isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, which is almost always associated with del(11p13); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000078'>genital anomalies</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000037'>male pseudohermaphroditism</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0950121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Denys-Drash syndrome</z:e>; and more weakly associated or uncommon conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796113" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perlman syndrome</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (WT) surveillance for specific high risk phenotypes should include a rational schedule of abdominal ultrasound examinations, taking into account the epidemiology of WT associated with specific disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical examination, with emphasis on abdominal palpation, and urinalysis should also be performed on a rational schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The schedule of examinations needs to be arrived at with input from clinical geneticists, oncologists, epidemiologists and pathologists with WT expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, care-takers of high risk individuals should be taught abdominal palpation, to be performed daily at home </plain></SENT>
