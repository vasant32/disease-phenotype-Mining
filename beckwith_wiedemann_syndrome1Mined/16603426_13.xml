<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding of 11p15 mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) led to the identification of imprinted growth-promoting genes which are expressed paternally and of imprinted growth-suppressing genes in the same region that are expressed maternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the opposite (epi)mutations of the same region have been reported to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>: maternal duplications of 11p15 as well as hypomethylation of the telomeric 11p15 imprinting domain (ICR1) could be identified in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a disease which is in particular characterised by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether 11p15 mutations are generally involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> we screened 125 growth retarded patients, among them 47 patients with SRS-like features and 20 with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional 58 patients were presented with clinical signs not consistent with SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded 11p15 duplications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 123 families by short tandem repeat typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICR1 hypomethylation was investigated by Southern-blot analyses and was therefore restricted to samples with a large amount of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified ICR1 hypomethylation in 20% of the patients with SRS-like features (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No further cases were detectable in the other two subgroups with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> (n=20) and with clinical signs not consistent with SRS (n=23), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show that 11p15 duplications are rare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> in general and that they seem to be restricted to patients with SRS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, testing for the ICR1 hypomethylation should also be focused on patients with SRS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While the ICR1 epimutation is detectable with a significant frequency only in SRS patients, its role for isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
