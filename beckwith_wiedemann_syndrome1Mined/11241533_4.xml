<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of postnatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) due to an unbalanced translocation that had not been diagnosed in the fetal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This first cytogenetic analysis revealed that one chromosome 14 presented as a common acrocentric short arm polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analyses after birth, using C-banding, NOR staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with telomeric probes, revealed that it was the result of an unbalanced de novo t(11;14)(p15;p13) translocation leading to partial 11p <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> and to BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prenatal cytogenetic management of such apparently inoffensive chromosome markers is discussed </plain></SENT>
