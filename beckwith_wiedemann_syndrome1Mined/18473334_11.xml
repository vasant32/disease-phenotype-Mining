<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RS is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0008846'>severe intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of RS cases were recently shown to have mosaic hypomethylation within the H19/IGF2 imprinting center, predicted to silence paternally expressed IGF2 in early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis for BWS and RS involves methylation analysis of the H19 locus, enabling discrimination of allelic methylation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting analysis (MS-HRM) was used to analyze methylation within the intergenic region of the H19 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 samples comprising <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (11), BWS (19), and RS (six) DNA were analyzed in a blinded study and scored as hypermethylated, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or hypomethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those derived by methylation-sensitive Southern blotting using the restriction enzymes Rsa I and Hpa II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 100% concordance was obtained for the Southern blotting and MS-HRM scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of three samples with paternal duplication affecting the H19/IGF2 region were scored as equivocal by both methods; however, 33 out of 36 (92%) the samples were unambiguously scored as being hypermethylated, hypomethylated, or normally methylated using MS-HRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MS-HRM is a rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive method for screening mosaic methylation changes at the H19 locus in BWS and RS </plain></SENT>
