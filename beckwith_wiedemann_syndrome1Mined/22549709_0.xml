<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) offer revolutionary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> treatments for millions of childless couples around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, ART accounts for 1 to 3% of annual births in industrialized countries and continues to expand rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature births</z:hpo>, these technologies are considered safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, new evidence published during the past decade has suggested an increased incidence of imprinting disorders in children conceived by ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, an increased risk was reported for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, Silver-Russell syndrome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some studies have found no association between ART and BWS, AS, Prader-Willi syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variability in ART protocols and the rarity of imprinting disorders complicate determining the causative relationship between ART and an increased incidence of imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, compelling experimental data from animal studies also suggest a link between increased imprinting disorders and ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further comprehensive, appropriately powered studies are needed to better address the magnitude of the risk for ART-associated imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large longitudinal studies are particularly critical to evaluate long-term effects of ART not only during the perinatal period but also into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An important consideration is to determine if the implicated association between ART and imprinting disorders is actually related to the procedures or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> itself </plain></SENT>
