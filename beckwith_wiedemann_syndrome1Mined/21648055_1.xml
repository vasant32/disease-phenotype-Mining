<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unique characteristic of imprinted genes is their expression from only one allele, maternal or paternal and dependent on parent of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This unique expression pattern may have arisen as a mechanism to control the flow of nutrients from the mother to the fetus, with maternally expressed imprinted genes reducing the flow of resources and paternally expressed genes increasing resources to the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, any epigenetic deregulation affecting this balance can result in fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imprinting-associated disorders in humans, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, support the role of imprinted genes in fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, assisted reproductive technologies in animals have been shown to affect the epigenome of the early embryo and the expression of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their role in disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> appears to be more complex, in that imprinted gene expression can be seen as both causative and protective of fetal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This protective or compensatory effect needs to be explored more fully </plain></SENT>
