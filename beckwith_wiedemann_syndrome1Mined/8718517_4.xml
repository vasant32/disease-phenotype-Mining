<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinting is vital for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development, and disruption of imprinting mechanisms on syntenic chromosomes gives very similar phenotypes in mouse and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting provides a plausible explanation for preferential LOH in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is evidence that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e>, dysregulation of specific imprinted genes may give rise to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many more questions regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> need to be answered before the associations described in this review can be properly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most basic issues, such as when and how the imprint is established, can still only be speculated upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further study of new imprinted genes and the relationship between their domains and differential replication may show us higher control mechanisms than methylation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remains to be seen if these epigenetic modifications are amenable to therapeutic change in the treatment of inherited syndromes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or if they can be used to assess individuals at risk of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Until then it is probably unwise to speculate on a single unifying theory that explains why a subset of the genome shows such a peculiar non-Mendelian form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
