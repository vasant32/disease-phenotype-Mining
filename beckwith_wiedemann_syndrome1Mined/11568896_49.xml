<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests that DNA methylation is required for proper gene regulation during development and in differentiated tissues and has clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is also involved in X-chromosome inactivation and the allele-specific silencing of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review describes possible mechanisms by which DNA methylation can regulate gene expression, using imprinted genes as examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of methylation-mediated gene regulation is related to changes in chromatin structure and appears to be similar for both imprinted and biallelically expressed genes </plain></SENT>
