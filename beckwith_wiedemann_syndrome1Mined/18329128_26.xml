<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central members in the growth pathways are regulated epigenetically and thereby reflect the profound significance of imprinting for correct mammalian ontogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we show that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> disorder Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a suitable model to decipher the role of imprinting in growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As we will show, SRS should not only be regarded as the genetically (and clinically) opposite disease to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, but it also represents the first human disorder with imprinting disturbances that affect two different chromosomes (i.e. chromosomes 7 and 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, a functional interaction between factors encoded by chromosomes 7 and 11 is likely </plain></SENT>
