<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>Adrenocortical carcinoma</z:hpo> (ADCC) is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e>, affecting three of 1 million children younger than 16 years old in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ADCC may be found in association with the Li-Fraumeni and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children with ADCC are also at substantially increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of these associations, it is believed that the genetic basis for ADCC is stronger than for most childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germline mutations of the TP53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predisposition in families with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> as well as in individuals with sporadically occurring component <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the possibility that germline TP53 gene alterations existed in children with ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen children with ADCC under the age of 18 were identified from searches of medial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> records at three Canadian hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these 16 patients identified were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years (range, 1-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Family histories were obtained for 11 unselected children with ADCC (six girls and five boys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathologic confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnosis was obtained from the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by single-strand DNA sequencing, genomic DNA extracted from whole blood was analyzed for the presence of TP53 mutations for six living ADCC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of six (50%) children were found to carry germline TP53 mutations in exons 5, 6, and 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant alleles were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three TP53 sequences, indicating that the patients were heterozygous for germline TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of these children was from a family with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mutation in one child was shown to be inherited from the mother, who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A striking excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found in one family of a patient carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observation of a high frequency of germline TP53 mutations in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ADCC suggests that these children may represent probands with which to ascertain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It may be reasonable for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinoma</z:hpo> to be candidates for germline TP53 analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In light of the wealth of information in the Li-Fraumeni literature that associates germline TP53 mutations with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, this testing may have important consequences for risk assessment for other close relatives, including early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in the mothers </plain></SENT>
