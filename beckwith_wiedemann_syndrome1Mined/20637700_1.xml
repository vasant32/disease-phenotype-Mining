<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although renal and adrenal pathology are the most commonly associated urologic findings of BWS, we report a case of a girl with BWS and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000057'>clitoromegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>recurrent urinary tract infections</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000076'>vesicoureteral reflux</z:hpo>, followed by a review of the literature regarding urologic manifestations of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature for renal and non-renal urologic manifestations of BWS was conducted using a computer-based (PubMed) search </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to well-described renal manifestations, a variety of non-renal urologic findings have been reported in patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers should carefully evaluate both patients and their family members for urologic manifestations of BWS </plain></SENT>
