<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common molecular alterations include loss of methylation at the proximal imprinting center, IC2, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 11p15 and hypermethylation at the distal imprinting center, IC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence of female monozygotic twins discordant for BWS has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for eleven such female twin pairs has been demonstrated to be a loss of methylation at IC2, whereas only one male monozygotic twin pair has been reported with this molecular defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here two new pairs of male monozygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One pair is discordant for BWS; the affected twin exhibits paternal UPD for chromosome 11p15 whereas the unaffected twin does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second male twin pair is concordant for BWS and both twins of the pair demonstrate hypermethylation at IC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this report expands the known molecular etiologies for BWS twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these findings demonstrate a new epigenotype-phenotype correlation in BWS twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That is, while female monozygotic twins with BWS are likely to show loss of imprinting at IC2, male monozygotic twins with BWS reflect the molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> seen in BWS singletons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the need for molecular testing in BWS twins, especially in view of the known differences among 11p15 epigenotypes with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
