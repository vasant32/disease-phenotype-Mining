<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in a cluster of imprinted genes found within a genomic region of approximately one megabase on human chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes are expressed preferentially or exclusively from either the paternal or maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 11p15 region is organized into two imprinted domains in which <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> is controlled by separate 'imprinting control regions' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five to 50% of BWS patients have biallelic rather than monoallelic expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 50% of patients have an epigenetic mutation resulting in loss of imprinting of a transcript called KCNQ1OT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each of these genes resides in one of the two imprinted domains that appear to be subject to developmental dysregulation in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the insights that the study of BWS have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of growth control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, methylation and chromatin modification may coordinate the expression of closely linked imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we discuss how knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms associated with the early stages of embryogenesis suggest caution in the current debate surrounding assisted reproductive and cloning technologies </plain></SENT>
