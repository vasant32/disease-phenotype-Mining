<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas diffuse CHI is of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo>, or less frequently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, focal CHI is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common mechanism underlying CHI is dysfunction of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>(ATP)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two subunits of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>(ATP) channel are encoded by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor gene (SUR1 or ABCC8) and the inward-rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel gene (KIR6.2 or KCNJ11), both located in the 11p15.1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germ-line, paternally inherited, mutations of the SUR1 or KIR6.2 genes, together with somatic maternal haplo-insufficiency for 11p15.5, were shown to result in focal CHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse CHI results from germ-line mutations in the SUR1 or KIR6.2 genes, but also from mutations in several other genes, namely <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (with associated hyperammonaemia), glucokinase, short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and insulin receptor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia</z:hpo> may be observed in several overlapping syndromes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796113" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perlman syndrome</z:e>, and, more rarely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
