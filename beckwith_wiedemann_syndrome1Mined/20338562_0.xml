<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Two children with the morphologic features of BWS as a result of a spontaneous conception and an ART cycle from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Assisted reproductive technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Neonatal and pediatric morphologic evaluation by geneticists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Two children with the morphologic features consistent with the criteria for the diagnosis of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> may be carriers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that can be passed to a child with or without the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) </plain></SENT>
