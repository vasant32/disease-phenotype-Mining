<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are at least 6 well-studied imprinting domains on human autosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each domain is under the regulatory control of an 'imprinting centre' that harbours a differentially methylated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of molecular mechanisms result in differential silencing of some genes within these domains and gene expression is tightly regulated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this makes them vulnerable to naturally occurring genetic and epigenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine recognisable developmental syndromes have been described due to abnormalities within these 6 domains: transient neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (TND; at 6q24); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (at 11p15.5; 2 imprinted domains); maternal and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> syndromes (at 14q32); Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes (at 15q11-13), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> type 1b (at 20q12-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is now recognised that involvement at multiple domains can occur simultaneously and result in what has been described as the hypomethylation syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TND and BWS are discussed in more detail as examples of imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
