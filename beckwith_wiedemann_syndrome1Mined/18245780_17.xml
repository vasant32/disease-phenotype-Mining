<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The parent of origin-dependent expression of the IGF2 and H19 genes is controlled by the imprinting centre 1 (IC1) consisting in a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions removing part of IC1 have been found in patients affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations result in the hypermethylation of the remaining IC1 region, loss of IGF2/H19 imprinting and fully penetrant BWS phenotype when maternally transmitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report that 12 additional cases with IC1 hypermethylation have a similar clinical phenotype but showed neither a detectable deletion nor other mutation in the local vicinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no IC1 deletion was detected in 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A detailed analysis of the BWS patients showed that the hypermethylation variably affected the IC1 region and was generally mosaic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and in at least two families affected and unaffected members shared the same maternal IC1 allele but not the abnormal maternal chromosome epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the chromosome with the imprinting defect derived from either the maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results indicate that methylation-imprinting defects at the IGF2-H19 locus can result from inherited mutations of the IC and have high recurrence risk or arise independently from the sequence context and generally not transmitted to the progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, the epigenetic abnormalities are usually present in the patients in the mosaic form and probably acquired by post-zygotic de novo methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between these two groups of cases is important for genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
