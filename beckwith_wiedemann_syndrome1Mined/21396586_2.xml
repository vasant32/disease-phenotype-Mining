<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the majority of individuals, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is the result of exposure to an 'obesogenic' environment, superimposed on a background of genetic susceptibility brought about by evolutionary adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These individuals tend to be tall in childhood with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> final adult height, as opposed to those who have an underlying monogenic cause where <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> is more common (although not universal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identifying genetic causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, within this setting can be extremely problematic and yet it is imperative that clinicians remain alert, as identification of a genetic diagnosis has major implications for the individual, family and potential offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alongside this, the recognition of new genetic mutations in this area is furthering our knowledge on the important mechanisms that regulate childhood growth and body composition </plain></SENT>
