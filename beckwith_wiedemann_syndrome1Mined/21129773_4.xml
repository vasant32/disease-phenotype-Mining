<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of imprinted genes is regulated by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many imprinted genes are expressed in the placenta and affect nutrient transfer capacity of the placental exchange barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The H19 gene is abundantly expressed by the human placenta and is implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital growth disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> (BWS) and Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DNA methylation on H19 transcription and imprinting, in the pathophysiology of fetal growth restriction (FGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty one and 17 placentas from FGR-complicated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies were collected, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied gene transcription, genotyping and methylation analysis of the AluI H19 on exon 5 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Placental expression levels of H19 were significantly increased in the FGR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The H19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were similar between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placental samples that demonstrated loss and maintenance of imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Placentas from growth-restricted pregnancies had lower methylation levels compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, in the H19 promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated an increased H19 transcription in the FGR group of placentas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hypomethylation of the H19 promoters is compatible with the aberrant expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of these two findings is reported for the first time in placental tissues, however, its significance remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether the results of this study represent an adaptation of the placenta to hypoperfusion, or they are part of FGR pathophysiology has to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
