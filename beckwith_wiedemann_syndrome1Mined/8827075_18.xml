<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overlapping clinical phenotypes are seen in two other disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e> (SGBS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796113" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perlman syndrome</z:e> (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BWS is a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder most often associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes and a negative family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission of BWS is reported, as are chromosome 11p15.5 abnormalities, uniparental paternal disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11p15.5, and altered expression of the imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) from the normally repressed maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crucial to our understanding of the large variety of genetic presentations in BWS is the concept of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, a process in which gene expression specific to parent-of-origin is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current genetic and molecular data for BWS are best explained by a model assuming an imprinted domain for 11p15.5, whereby altered expression of one or more genes in this region contributes to the BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this model, a defined chromatin structure is reflected in coordinated control of multiple genes in the domain, as well as specific patterns of replication timing and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data supporting this viewpoint include the maternally derived 11p15.5 translocation breakpoints associated with BWS, and the recent finding that the normally asynchronous pattern of replication timing for the imprinted gene IGF2 can be disrupted, shifted by a BWS-associated translocation 400 kh from IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As we unravel the molecular basis of the different BWS patient subgroups, we will achieve a better understanding of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome and its relationship to WT </plain></SENT>
