<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: During the past two decades, assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have revolutionised the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ARTs now account for between 1% and 3% of annual births in many western countries and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) services are growing worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the incidence of abnormalities at birth is reassuringly low and children develop normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is important to monitor the safety of ARTs as clinical protocols evolve and new technologies emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STARTING POINT: Three recent studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> report an unexpectedly high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) in children conceived with ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 149 cases were reported from a British BWS registry (J Med Genet 2003; 40: 62-64); the same numbers were recorded in a French registry (Am J Hum Genet 2003; 72: 1338-41), and a further seven children have been reported in the USA (Am J Hum Genet 2003; 72: 156-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These frequencies are extraordinarily high for such a rare congenital condition and such findings are reminiscent of reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of the imprinting disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, which has also been linked with ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>WHERE NEXT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuing surveillance of children conceived with ARTs is needed, including monitoring birth defects, development, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies will need to be prospective and multicentre, and should include molecular characterisation of epigenetic abnormalities, including the methylation status of imprinting control regions within imprinted gene clusters </plain></SENT>
