<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent observations have revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo>, severity, and etiology of certain human diseases can be explained by aberrations in the establishment or the maintenance of the imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): Nat Genet 4:110-113], and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp>) [Julier et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We review the evidence that implicates an imprinted gene in the INS-IGF2 region of chromosome 11p15 in the etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp> (referred to as the IDDM2 locus) and show that in human fetal pancreas, INS is not imprinted, thus providing an argument against INS as the candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examine imprinting effects on the expression of IGF2 in components of the human immune system believed to be important in <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp> and show imprinted expression in fetal thymus as early as 15 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate further that in the circulating mononuclear cells of two individuals, lectin-stimulated IGF2 transcription was biallelic, indicating relaxation of imprinting, whereas in one individual, transcription was monoallelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we review the current available data supporting a role for insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the immune system and, more specifically, discuss the evidence supporting a role for the IGFs in the prevention of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data have led us to formulate a novel hypothesis that could mechanistically explain the involvement of the IDDM2 locus in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
