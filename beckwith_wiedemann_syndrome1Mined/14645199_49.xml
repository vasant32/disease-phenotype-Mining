<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases the majority of patients have epimutations in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene is frequently observed in BWS, as is reduced CDKN1C expression related to loss of maternal allele-specific methylation (LOM) of the differentially methylated region KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The causes of epimutations are unknown, although recently an association with assisted reproductive technologies has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date the only genetic mutations described in BWS are in the CDKN1C gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to screen for other genetic predispositions to BWS, the conserved sequences between human and mouse differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the IGF2 gene were analyzed for variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in DMR0 (T123C, G358A, T382G and A402G) which occurred in three out of 16 possible haplotypes: TGTA, CATG and CAGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from a cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS patients and healthy controls were genotyped for the DMR0 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the frequency of the CAGA haplotype and a significant decrease in the frequency of the CATG haplotype in the patient cohort compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations were still significant in a BWS subgroup with KvDMR1 LOM, suggesting that the G allele at T382G SNP (CAGA haplotype) is associated with LOM at KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates either a genetic predisposition to LOM or interactions between genotype and epigenotype that impinge on the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
