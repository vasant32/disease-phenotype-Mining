<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first case with a de novo duplication and extra material on 11p, the region spanning pter to CALCA, excluded, was duplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second case, the rearrangement was characterized using somatic cell hybrids established with lymphocytes from the father who carried a balanced translocation t(11;18)(p15.4;p11.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint lay exactly in the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It could thus be inferred that the two sons, who were the first cases reported of BWS with dup11p15 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinoma</z:hpo> (ADCC), carried a duplication similar to that observed in the first case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with evidence for specific somatic chromosomal events leading to loss of 11p15 alleles in familial cases of ADCC, it can be hypothesized that a gene involved in predisposition to ADCC maps to region 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
