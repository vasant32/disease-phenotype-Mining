<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 10-year-old African-American male has been followed since 2 years of age due to his <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>mental retardation, severe</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo>, and dysmorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic analysis, chromosome painting, high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization (BAC FISH) revealed an apparent duplication in the short arm of a chromosome 11, dup(11)(p14.3p15.1), seen also in his mentally retarded mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proband had moderate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, a history of IUGR, infantile <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, FTT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo> repair, and several dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His mother had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo>, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100710'>impulsivity</z:hpo>, assaultive outbursts, and similar dysmorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although G-banding and FISH indicated a duplication, HR-CGH confined the localization of material to bands 11p14-11p15 and aided the selection of locus-specific BAC clones to more precisely characterize the duplicated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the results represent the first example of a familial, cytogenetically visible duplication of euchromatin in 11p that excludes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that one or more genes had been disrupted at the breakpoints of the above structural chromosomal rearrangement giving rise to the present phenotype </plain></SENT>
