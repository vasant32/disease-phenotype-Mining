<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> syndrome, marking it as a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development </plain></SENT>
