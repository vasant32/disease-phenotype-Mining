<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> directly through PCR and single cell analysis on blood lymphocytes from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole genome amplification was performed on single cells and the resultant product was subjected to locus specific microsatellite marker analysis using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two populations of cells were detected, a population of cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> for chromosome 11 and a population of cells with partial paternal isodisomy of 11p between markers D11S922 (11p15.5) and D11S904 (11p14-p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with somatic recombination resulting in mosaicism for paternal isodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of single cell PCR is ideal for studying the distribution of mosaicism within and between tissues and has been used in this study to identify a cell line with <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
