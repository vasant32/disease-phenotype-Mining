<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of one or more imprinted genes located at chromosome 11p15.5, of which insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is the most likely candidate, is believed to cause BWS, whereas the etiology of KTWS is completely obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of BWS and a case of KTWS in a single family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probands, sons of two sisters, showed relaxation of the maternal IGF2 imprinting, although they inherited different 11p15.5 alleles from their mothers and did not show any chromosome rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with BWS also displayed hypomethylation at KvDMR1, a maternally methylated CpG island within an intron of the KvLQT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unaffected brother of the BWS proband shared the same maternal and paternal 11p15.5 haplotype with his brother, but the KvDMR1 locus was normally methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the H19 gene was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in both the BWS and KTWS probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linkage between the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) gene and the tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> was also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that a defective modifier or regulatory gene unlinked to 11p15.5 caused a spectrum of epigenetic alterations in the germ line or early development of both cousins, ranging from the relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in the KTWS proband to disruption of both the imprinted expression of IGF2 and the imprinted methylation of KvDMR1 in the BWS proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these data also indicates that loss of IGF2 imprinting is not necessarily linked to alteration of methylation at the KvDMR1 or H19 loci and supports the notion that IGF2 overexpression is involved in the etiology of the tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> observed in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorders, including KTWS </plain></SENT>
