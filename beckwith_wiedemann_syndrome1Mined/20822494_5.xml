<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> is a classical example of epigenetic regulation in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in humans and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of these are involved in foetal growth and deve lopment, others control behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mono-allelic expression of imprinted genes depends on whether the gene is inherited from the mother or the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This remarkable pattern of expression is controlled by specialized sequence elements called ICRs (imprinting control regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICRs are marked by DNA methylation on one of the two parental alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These allelic marks originate from either the maternal or the paternal germ line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases, including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and Silver-Russell syndromes, associated with aberrant foetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perturbed imprinted gene expression is also implicated in the neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e> Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Embryo culture and human-assisted reproduction procedures can increase the occurrence of imprinting-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recent research shows that, besides DNA methylation, covalent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> proteins also contribute to imprinting regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The involvement of imprinting in specific human pathologies (and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) emphasizes the need to further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
