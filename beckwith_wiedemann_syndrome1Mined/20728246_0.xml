<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>Nevus</z:hpo> simplex (NS) is a common birthmark on the forehead, glabella, upper eyelids, and nape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More widespread involvement can be confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo>) and other vascular birthmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To further categorize the anatomic locations in infants with extensive NS and evaluate for any possible disease associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with extensive NS seen at two tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with extensive NS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had at least one typical site of involvement: glabella (77.8%), nape (59.3%), and eyelids (55.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional sites were the scalp, including the vertex, occiput, parietal (66.7%); nose (66.7%); lip (59.2%); lumbosacral skin (55.6%); and upper and mid back (14.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of the study and relatively small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose the term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo> simplex complex" for NS with more widespread involvement beyond the typical sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent use of the term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo> simplex" will aid in correct diagnosis and appropriate management of these birthmarks </plain></SENT>
