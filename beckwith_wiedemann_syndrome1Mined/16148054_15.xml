<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and chromosomal anomalies, there is evidence that ART may be associated with increased epigenetic disorders in the infants who are conceived using these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic reprogramming is critical during gametogenesis and at preimplantation stage and involves DNA methylation, imprinting, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing, covalent modifications of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi>, and remodeling by other chromatin-associated complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic regulation is involved in early embryo development, fetal growth, and birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disturbances in epigenetic reprogramming may lead to developmental problems and early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest the increased incidence of imprinting disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> in children who are conceived with the use of ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These may result from an accumulation of epigenetic alterations during embryo culture and/or by altered embryonic developmental timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research is urgently needed to determine whether a causal relationship between ART and epigenetic disorders exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until then, cautious review of both short-term and long-term ART outcomes at a national level is recommended </plain></SENT>
