<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have constructed a 1-Mb contig in human chromosomal band 11p15.5, a region implicated in the etiology of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002898'>embryonal tumors</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cosmid, P1, PAC, and BAC clones were characterized by NotI/SalI digestion and hybridized to a variety of probes to generate a detailed physical map that extends from D11S517 to L23MRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included in the map are the CARS, NAP2, p57/KIP2, KVLQT1, ASCL2, TH, INS, IGF2, H19, and L23MRP genes as well as end probes isolated from PACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TAPA1 gene, whose protein product can transmit an antiproliferative signal, was also localized in the contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that its expression did not correlate with tumorigenicity in G401 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> hybrids, suggesting that TAPA1 is not responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression associated with 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic clones were used as probes in FISH analysis to map the breakpoints from three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> patients and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rhabdoid tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, each of the breakpoints disrupts the KVLQT1 gene, which is spread over a 400-kb region of the contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since 11p15.5 contains several genes with imprinted expression and one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes, our contig and map provide a framework for characterizing this intriguing genetic environment </plain></SENT>
