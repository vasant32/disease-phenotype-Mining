<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The quantitative evaluation of mosaicism for <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) involving a restricted chromosomal region requires the availability of a sensitive and reproducible method that is capable of detecting even a small percentage of disomic cells and avoiding false positive and false negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of UPD is usually monitored by means of the parent-proband segregation analysis of microsatellites mapping to the target region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here describe the quantitative blood cell evaluation of segmental mosaic UPD11, a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, by means of the segregation analysis of 11p15 microsatellites using both radioactive and fluorescence-based techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the greater amplification efficiency of the shorter allele in heterozygous subjects may bias the correct evaluation of disomy, the mean short/long allele ratio was established at three loci of each of 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heterozygous subjects, as well as the peak As/Al area in the presence of 50% of each allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interval was defined using a 5% level of significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that the fluorescence-based technique is superior to radioactivity in detecting the subtle allelic imbalances present in low-grade mosaicism conditions </plain></SENT>
