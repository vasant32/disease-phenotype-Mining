<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> children develop are very different from those seen in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically they resemble their relatively undifferentiated, fetal counterparts rather than the fully differentiated structures seen at, or soon after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic events responsible for initiating children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, therefore, must occur during embryonic life and prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells are frozen in the undifferentiated state and the malignant phenotype eventually arises as a result of secondary changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of secondary events occurs at varying rates and accounts for the variation in the time of presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike the adult situation environmental factors have not been identified as common causes of genetic damage in children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
