<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors described a new surgical approach for delayed closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo>--the Lazaro da Silva's technique--in conservatively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>Ventral hernias</z:hpo> of 11 conservatively treated patients were corrected by Lazaro da Silva's technique from 1987 to 2002 in Clinic's Hospital of UFMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure consisted of the bilateral longitudinal fibroperitoneal-aponeurotic transposition, resulting in 3 different layers of closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evolution of these patients is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of associated anomalies was observed in 8 patients (73%), with a predominance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No alterations were associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9142">silver sulfadiazine</z:chebi> for epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo>, no difficulties were related to the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no peri- and postoperative complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hospital stay was approximately 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aesthetic result was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results lead to the conclusion that conservative management of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphaloceles</z:hpo> with delayed closure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo> using Lazaro da Silva's technique is a safe and reliable approach for treating these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
