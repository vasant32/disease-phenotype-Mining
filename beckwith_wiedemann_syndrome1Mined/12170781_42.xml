<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on histopathologic features, two subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS), were identified and associated with distinct clinical characteristics and genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion products, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the specific translocations found in ARMS, most ERMS cases have allelic loss at chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome fragment transfer studies demonstrated that this region represses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth, suggesting the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene(s) in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both ERMS and ARMS, there is evidence of collaborating alterations that affect common targets, such as the p53 and RB pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One mechanism for perturbing these pathways involves amplification of genes such as MDM2 and CDK4; these amplification events occur frequently in ARMS but only rarely in ERMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite similarities in the downstream targets of these genetic alterations, the striking cytogenetic and molecular differences between ARMS and ERMS indicate distinct molecular etiologies in these two subtypes </plain></SENT>
