<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution chromosome analysis has narrowed the gap between cytogenetics and Mendelism by proving that some diseases considered to be due to monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> result in fact from deletion of contiguous genes or breakage of a specific gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene "imprinting" has been found to be the cause of some syndromes, such as the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetics has become a tool for analysing small rearrangements not easily seen using traditional chromosome analysis, for detecting mosaicisms, and narrowing the "critical" regions of chromosomal syndromes. "Positional cloning" techniques have improved our ability to map disease-genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies and direct analysis of cloned genes are now having a large impact on the analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> segregating in families, and in testing for healthy heterozygotes and presymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discovery of mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome has widened our understanding of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few disorders have been shown to be due to tandem amplification of GC-rich intragenic triplets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic counseling has taken advantage of these improvements which have a large impact on our knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and variability </plain></SENT>
