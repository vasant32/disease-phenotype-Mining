<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 11p15 was demonstrated using molecular probes in interphase nuclei of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded placenta from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillborn</z:hpo> fetus and in peripheral blood lymphocytes from two liveborn female relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001790'>nonimmune hydrops</z:hpo> and placentomegaly in two siblings and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> consistent with WBS in the two other relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paternal karyotype of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillborn</z:hpo> infants demonstrated a reciprocal translocation (46,XY,t(10;11) (q26;p15)) explaining the origin of the extra 11p15 material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates the advantages of FISH for interphase analysis of chromosome aberrations otherwise not detected even by conventional cytogenetic analysis and documents that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001790'>nonimmune hydrops</z:hpo> associated with placentomegaly may be the presenting features in familial WBS </plain></SENT>
