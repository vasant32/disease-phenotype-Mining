<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>Fetal macrosomia</z:hpo> is a common complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus and is associated with substantial morbidity, but the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>fetal macrosomia</z:hpo> are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The imprinted genes IGF-II and H19 are crucial for placental development and fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The term placentas from diabetic pregnancies express more insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) than those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of their imprinting status is observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>-associated syndrome, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether loss of imprinting hence biallelic expression was also a hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> in diabetic pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: IGF-II and H19 maternal and paternal expressions were studied in placentas from two groups of type 1 diabetic mothers: one with macrosomic babies and the other with babies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal or paternal allele specific expressions were defined by using DNA polymorphic markers of the IGF-II and H19 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RFLP analysis was performed on PCR products from genomic DNA of the father, the mother and the child, and on RT-PCR products from placental <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RFLP analysis showed that the IGF-II gene remains paternally expressed and the H19 gene remains maternally expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> placentas examined, independently of the birth weight status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in contrast with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, loss of imprinting for IGF-II or H19 is not a common feature of diabetic pregnancies associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
