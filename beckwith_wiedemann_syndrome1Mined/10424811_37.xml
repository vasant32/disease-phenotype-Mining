<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major features are anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo> including <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>), pre- and postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional less frequent complications include specific developmental defects and a predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BWS is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and epigenetic changes in the IGF2/H19 genes resulting in overexpression of IGF2 have been implicated in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently germline mutations in the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor gene CDKN1C (p57KIP2) have been reported in a variable minority of BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have investigated a large series of familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS patients for evidence of CDKN1C mutations by direct gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 patients with classical BWS were investigated; 54 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> with no evidence of UPD and 16 were familial from seven kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel germline CDKN1C mutations were identified in five probands, 3/7 (43%) familial cases and 2/54 (4%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between germline CDKN1C mutations and IGF2 or H19 epigenotype abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotype of 13 BWS patients with germline CDKN1C mutations was compared to that of BWS patients with other defined types of molecular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This showed a significantly higher frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> in the CDKN1C mutation cases (11/13) than in patients with an imprinting centre defect (associated with biallelic IGF2 expression and H19 silencing) (0/5, p&lt;0.005) or patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (0/9, p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between germline CDKN1C mutations and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No CDKN1C mutations were identified in six non-BWS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings (1) show that germline CDKN1C mutations are a frequent cause of familial but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS, (2) suggest that CDKN1C mutations probably cause BWS independently of changes in IGF2/H19 imprinting, (3) provide evidence that aspects of the BWS phenotype may be correlated with the involvement of specific imprinted genes, and (4) link genotype-phenotype relationships in BWS and the results of murine experimental models of BWS </plain></SENT>
