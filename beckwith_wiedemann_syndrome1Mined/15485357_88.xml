<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of epigenetics in the etiology of human disease is increasingly recognized with the most obvious evidence found for genes subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations and epimutations in imprinted genes can give rise to genetic and epigenetic phenotypes, respectively; <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and imprinting defects represent epigenetic disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that affect chromatin structure and remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These disorders can affect chromatin in trans or in cis, as well as expression of both imprinted and nonimprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from Angelman and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> and other disorders indicate that a monogenic or oligogenic phenotype can be caused by a mixed epigenetic and genetic and mixed de novo and inherited (MEGDI) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MEGDI model may apply to some complex disease traits and could explain negative results in genome-wide genetic scans </plain></SENT>
