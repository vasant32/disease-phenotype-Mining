<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we report on a male infant presenting the typical pattern of Jacobsen syndrome including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001905'>thrombocytopenia, congenital</z:hpo> heart defect, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008661'>urethral stenosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001338'>partial agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional karyotyping, FISH, SKY and CGH analyses showed that the region distal to the MLL locus on 11q23 was lost and replaced by the distal region of 11p, leading to a partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 11p and a partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of 11q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to ISCN (1995) the karyotype can be described as 46,XY,add(11)(q2?3). ish 11ptel(D11S2071x3),11qtel(VIJyRM2072x1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH analysis allowed us to narrow down the breakpoints to 11p15.1 and 11q24.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation analyses of genes located on 11p showed an increased level of the non-methylated paternal allele of the KCNQ1OT1 gene, confirming the concomitant presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype resulting from the 11q deletion seems to dominate the phenotype due to the distal 11p <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the parents revealed that this chromosomal rearrangement was caused by a paternal pericentric inversion inv(11)(p15q24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since chromosomal aberrations like the one described here can easily be overlooked during routine chromosome analysis, combined FISH analysis using subtelomeric and possibly additional probes should be applied if there is any doubt about the integrity of telomeric regions </plain></SENT>
