<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Height was above the 90th percentile (%) for chronological age (CA) after age 2 years, reaching an average of 2.5 SD above the mean at or after puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult or attained height also exceeded significantly (P less than 0.015) parental (genetic) target height by 13.2 cm on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one girl, adult height prognosis (190 cm) could be reduced to an adult height of 183 cm by high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most children, growth velocity remained above the 90th % up to 4-6 years of age and normalized thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied, bone age was markedly advanced and particularly so during the first 4 years after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weight was above the 90th-97th % during infancy and early childhood and remained there, appropriate or slightly subnormal for height, until adulthood, except for 3 girls who reached and maintained the 50th % during or after puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous pubertal development occurred within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits for CA and around the 50th % for BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for the marked bone age acceleration, the reason for the increased statural growth and adult height in patients with the EMG syndrome is still unknown </plain></SENT>
