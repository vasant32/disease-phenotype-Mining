<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using nested reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the expression of P57KIP2, LIT1, TSSC3 in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transcripts of P57KIP2 were detected in human oocytes and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of preimplantation embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LIT1 was expressed only in stages of 8-cell and blastocyst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcripts of TSSC3 could not be detected in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcripts of P57KIP2 and LIT1, imprinted genes related to BWS, were detected in human preimplantation development; ART might affect the epigenetics of imprinted genes in early embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
