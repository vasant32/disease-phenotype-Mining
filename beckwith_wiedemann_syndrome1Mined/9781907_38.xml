<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may be an isolated finding in an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual, or it may occur in several syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although isolated hemihyperplasia (IHH) is of unknown cause, it may represent one end of the clinical spectrum of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uniparental paternal disomy of 11p15.5 or altered expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) from the normally silent maternal allele have been implicated as causes of some cases of WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IHH and other mild manifestations of WBS may represent patchy overexpression of the IGF2 gene following defective imprinting in a mosaic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The natural history of IHH varies markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association among many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes and a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heretofore the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development in children with IHH was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report on the results of a prospective multicenter clinical study of the incidence and nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in children evaluated because of IHH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-eight patients were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 tumors developed in nine patients, for an overall incidence of 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were of embryonal origin (similar to those noted in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorders), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>, adrenal cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> of the small bowel in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data support a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surveillance protocol for children with IHH similar to that performed in other syndromes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
