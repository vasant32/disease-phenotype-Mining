<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human chromosomal region 11p15.5, which is homologous to mouse chromosome region 7F5, is a well-known imprinted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 imprinted domain, which is one of two imprinted domains at 11p15.5, includes nine imprinted genes regulated by an imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 IC is a differentially methylated region of KCNQ1OT1(KCNQ1OT-DMR) with DNA methylation on the maternal allele and no methylation on the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDKN1C (alias p57KIP2), an imprinted gene with maternal expression, encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a critical gene within the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), approximately 50% of patients show loss of DNA methylation accompanied by loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys9 dimethylation on maternal KCNQ1OT-DMR, namely an imprinting disruption, leading to diminished expression of CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, at least three molecular mechanisms--imprinting disruption, aberrant DNA methylations at the CDKN1C promoter, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the maternal allele--are seen and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three result in diminished expression of CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imprinting disruption of the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 domain is involved in the development of both BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and it changes the maternal epigenotype to the paternal type, leading to diminished CDKN1C expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe recent advances in epigenetic control of the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 imprinted domain in both humans and mice </plain></SENT>
