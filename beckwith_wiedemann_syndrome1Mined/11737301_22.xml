<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe the clinical and histological features of a series of cases of placentas originally diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334529" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">partial moles</z:e> in which the final diagnosis was that of placental stem villous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo>, mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched a computerized database containing cases of suspected or proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135868" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">trophoblastic disease</z:e> examined at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135868" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Trophoblastic Disease</z:e> Unit at Charing Cross Hospital, London, to identify cases in which stem vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> was present without other histological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334529" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">partial mole</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each case, histological sections were examined and the histological features present recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 15 cases identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Placental weight was above the 95th centile of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for gestation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which this information was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an additional five cases the placenta was described as 'large' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had marked stem vessel hydropic change with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation and in the majority of cases some terminal villous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 of the 15 cases there was marked aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of stem villous vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine had focal chorioangiomatoid change and in four of these extramedullary haematopoiesis was focally present in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No excessive trophoblast proliferation was noted in any case and no trophoblastic inclusions typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334529" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">partial mole</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified cases of stem villous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo>, mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> spectrum in pregnancies initially diagnosed as partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform mole</z:mpath> in the second half of pregnancy and has highlighted the need for detailed pathological examination and clinicopathological correlation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such cases </plain></SENT>
