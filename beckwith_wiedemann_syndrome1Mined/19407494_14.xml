<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the well-known Prader-Willi, Angelman, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e>, imprinting disturbances have recently been identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (14) syndromes and Silver- Russell syndrome (SRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these diseases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> disorder SRS is unique because it is the first human disorder associated with epigenetic mutations that affect two different chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7, hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 in 11p15 and maternal duplication of 11p15 have recently been described as major (epi)genetic disturbances in SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, opposite (epi)- mutations are involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus SRS and BWS can be regarded as two genetically and clinically opposite clinical pictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although not yet completely understood, SRS and BWS can be used as models to decipher the functional link between the observed (epi)genetic mutations and the clinical features in individuals with disturbed growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies will clarify the complex basis of human growth and hopefully contribute to better-directed therapies </plain></SENT>
