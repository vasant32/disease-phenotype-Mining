<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a three generation family in which a father and son have a balanced chromosome translocation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> of chromosomes 5 and 11 (karyotype 46,XY,t(5;11)(p15.3;p15.3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two family members have inherited the unbalanced products of this translocation and are trisomic for chromosome 11p15.3--&gt;pter and monosomic for chromosome 5p15.3--&gt;pter (karyotype 46,XY,der(5)t(5;11)(p15.3;p15.3)pat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paternally derived duplications of 11p15.5 are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and both family members trisomic for 11p15.5 had prenatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> (birth weights &gt;97th centile), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000280'>coarse facial features</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001169'>broad hands</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review the clinical features of BWS patients who have a paternally derived duplication of 11p15.5 and provide evidence for a distinct pattern of dysmorphic features in those with this chromosome duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our family is the fifth unrelated family to be reported with a balanced reciprocal translocation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> of chromosomes 5 and 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparently non-random nature of this particular chromosome translocation is suggestive of sequence homology between the two chromosome regions involved in the translocation </plain></SENT>
