<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is called the parental imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parental imprinting plays an important role in development and a dysregulation can lead to various <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of the parental imprinting or its alteration is implicated in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the process is altered, two homologous chromosomes may come from the same parent, a situation termed <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GENETIC DISEASE IN MAN: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> in man are known to be related to the parental imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Willi-Prader disease, Angelman disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> disease are the most extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MECHANISMS: Some of the underlying mechanisms are known, but several points concerning the parental imprinting remain to be elucidated, particularly the precise nature of the molecular mechanisms and the identification of the genes controlling this genetic process </plain></SENT>
