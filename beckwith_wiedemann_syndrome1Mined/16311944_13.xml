<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are similarities between SGA and VLBW children in that both are exposed to sub-optimal environments that encompass undernutrition and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> during the equivalent of the last trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although both SGA and VLBW groups fail to reach genetic height potential and are recognized causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in childhood, there are differences between the groups with respect to the growth hormone and IGF-I axis.SGA children have elevated IGFI levels, possibly due to either <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> or partial IGF-I resistance, whereas VLBW children have low IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels suggestive of GH resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the nature and timing of the early insult may lead to discordant changes to the metabolic and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> axes.IVF children are taller with increased IGF I, IGF II and IGFBP3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes could be due to alterations in the environment of the periconceptual embryo resulting in changes in imprinting of genes involved in growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and metabolic consequences of alterations in the periconceptual, fetal and early neonatal periods is an area of intense investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future research in this field is likely to focus on the mechanisms through which environmental changes lead to these programmed effects </plain></SENT>
