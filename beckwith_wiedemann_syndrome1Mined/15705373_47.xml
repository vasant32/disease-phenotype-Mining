<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An association between assisted reproductive technique (ART) and specific imprinting mutations, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), has recently been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on experiments in farm animals that demonstrated an association between alterations in culture media during ART and large offspring syndrome, we hypothesized that the culture media could be implicated as a common factor among the children with BWS conceived after ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Registry from Academic Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Nineteen children born after ART were identified within the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographics of patients, type of ART, culture media, IVF parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Twelve of the 19 medical records from the reproductive <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> centers were successfully obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 mothers of children with BWS had IVF, but no single, consistent culture media was used in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients underwent IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI; n = 5), whereas the other half had routine IVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One child was conceived through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3753">clomiphene citrate</z:chebi> (CC) stimulation and artificial insemination, whereas another patient conceived through gonadotropin stimulation with intrauterine insemination (IUI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The gonadotropin dosage and quantity of embryos transferred also varied significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only consistent finding was that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 women received some type of ovarian stimulation medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Large epidemiologic studies are needed to further study the association between BWS and ART </plain></SENT>
