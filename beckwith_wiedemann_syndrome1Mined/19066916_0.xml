<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to review the outcomes of neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> in our neonatal intensive care unit during the last 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective study 52 neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> were identified from 1996 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>Exomphalos</z:mp> were stratified by the type of defect [<z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor versus major (major defined as defect size more than 5 cm and/or liver in the sac)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, demographic data, and outcome measures of mortality, length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation and age at full enteral feeds were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated anomalies were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 52 neonates, 1 was transferred back to referring hospital after surgical repair of the defect and was not analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>Exomphalos</z:mp> minor accounted for 24 cases and <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major in 27 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was higher in infants with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major (n = 9, 33%) compared to infants with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor (n = 2, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median LOS (10 vs. 47 days, P = 0.023), median age at full enteral feeds (5 vs. 23 days, P = 0.004) and median duration of mechanical ventilation (7 vs. 23 days, P = 0.001) were shorter for <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bacteremia</z:e> was present in 4 (15%) of neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Syndromic associations were present in 8 neonates (33%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor compared to 2 neonates (7%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> was most frequently noted in neonates with syndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 13 was the only chromosomal abnormality in the entire cohort (1/51 = 2%) and was seen in a single neonate (1/27 = 3.7%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Non-syndromic anomalies were seen in 12 (50%) and 14 neonates (52%) with the minor and major defects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only four neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor (16%) and ten neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major (37%) had no associated anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002089'>Pulmonary hypoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> were identified on either lung biopsy or autopsy (n = 5) as causes of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neonates with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor have better survival, decreased LOS, time to full enteral feeds and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Syndromic associations were more common in <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>Respiratory failure</z:hpo> was the major cause of mortality in infants with <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> major </plain></SENT>
