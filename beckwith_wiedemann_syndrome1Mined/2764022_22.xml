<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition occurred in sibs born to carrier women and in children born to affected mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presumptive carrier women were examined for microsigns of WBS in an attempt to determine whether extreme variability of the disorder, rather than an unaffected carrier state, was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No minor stigmata of the WBS could be found in the presumptive carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study supports a previous hypothesis that in some families the WBS can be transmitted in a 2-step process involving first an unstable premutation and then a "telomutation." Because only females appear to be transmitters of the telomutation, an ovum-mediated sex-associated factor may be involved in the process of telomutation </plain></SENT>
