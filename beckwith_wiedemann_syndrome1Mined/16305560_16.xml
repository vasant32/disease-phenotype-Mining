<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that approximately 1% of the newborn population of the British Isles are conceived following assisted reproduction technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the long term outcome of IVF children is mostly reassuring, some concerns remain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, recent studies have suggested a possible association between assisted conception and clinical conditions of genetic origin known as <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has arisen from several different studies observing an excess of assisted conceptions among the rare clinical disorders of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of such patients described in the studies to date are small but indicate a clear need for large-scale investigations to clarify the link between <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> defects and assisted conception as well as to establish the exact biological basis of any such link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the strong public interest in this area of medicine, it behoves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> professionals working in reproductive medicine and associated areas to be aware of these emerging data and be in a position to discuss them in as informed and responsible a manner with patients, as current data limitations permit </plain></SENT>
