<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from its obvious importance as a model for renal development and differentiation, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> has recently been exploited as an example of the action of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes (or anti-oncogenes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter genes are characterised by a somatic loss of genetic information in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development, specifically from the short arm of human chromosome 11 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further study the developmental aspects of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> we have established in vitro cell cultures from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues, which, unlike the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> cell lines, have been genotyped according to their chromosome 11 gene status and their antigen expression patterns, compared to the original <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell cultures exist both as primary and secondary cultures, and their limited life span in culture has been extended by transfection of SV40 large T antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppression by the Wilms' locus has been explored by producing cell hybrids between the immortalised kidney cells, and an "indicator cell" (HeLa), whose chromosome 11 genotypes have been monitored in vivo and in vitro by restriction fragment length polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-random patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the mutant allele have also been investigated, both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and in syndromes, like the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e>, which pre-dispose to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> (and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is also apparent that allele-specific methylation occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> tissues, probably resulting in changes of gene expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant elevation of transcription of the N-myc oncogene was detected in the blastemal cells of the most malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumours</z:e>, whereas a marked decrease in the expression of HLA class I, at both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels was observed in the same cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilm's tumour</z:e> provides a clear illustration of the requirement for a combination of dominantly and recessively acting genes, in order to produce a malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
