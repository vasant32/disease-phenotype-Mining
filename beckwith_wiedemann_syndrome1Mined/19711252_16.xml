<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 2002, a series of reports have suggested an increased risk of imprinting disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>) in children conceived by ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Definitive conclusions are difficult to substantiate due to the rarity of imprinting disorders and the variability in ART protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations, there is biological plausibility for alteration in nongenomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> caused by ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animal studies have shown that ART procedures can alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting, specifically DNA methylation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collectively, studies suggest an association between ART and loss of maternal methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recent reports examined a possible association between ART and global hypomethylation of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three other imprinting disorders (Silver-Russell syndrome, maternal hypomethylation syndrome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>) have also been implicated, but there is insufficient evidence to establish an association of these syndromes with ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on current evidence, the absolute risk of imprinting disorders after ART remains small and does not warrant routine screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large prospective studies are needed to better understand the risks associated with imprinting disorders, imprinting defects, and ART </plain></SENT>
