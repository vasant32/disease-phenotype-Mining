<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of two kinds operates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first is that four other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> are regularly observed in children, and the second is that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> itself appears to represent more than one genetic entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five of these primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0009726'>renal tumors</z:hpo> arise from primary or secondary mesenchyme, renal blastema, or renal epithelium </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least three different genes seem to be important in the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One, WT1, whose mutations may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, may follow the "two hit" model in that there are cases in which both copies of the gene are defective or lost, as expected for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second gene, which is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and which has not been cloned, appears to be imprinted in females, and may have an oncogene function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is evidently activated by gain of a paternal allele or by loss of the inactive, but possibly trans-sensing, maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of the insulin-like growth factor II gene may be a final common pathway for mutation in both WT1 and BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A third gene is unlinked to either of the other two, but its location and function are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It shares with WT1 specificity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, which is not true of the BWS gene </plain></SENT>
