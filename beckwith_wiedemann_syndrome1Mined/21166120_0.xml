<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animal models are important for investigating the possible role of each step of ART (ovarian stimulation, gamete manipulation, in vitro fertilization, embryo culture and embryo transfer) in epigenetic reprogramming This review discusses these issues in the context of epigenetic and developmental abnormalities observed in animals following ART More research is needed on ART-induced errors, focusing not only on <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> but also on non-imprinted loci, which may help explain some of the more subtle longer-term health effects emerging from studies with animal models </plain></SENT>
