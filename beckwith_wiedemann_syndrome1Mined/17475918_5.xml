<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the father of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and a pure truncation of 18q22-qter, a new aphidicolin-sensitive fragile site on chromosome 18q22.2 (FRA18C) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region in 18q22 appears highly enriched in flexibility islands previously found to be the characteristic of common fragile site regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint was cloned in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The break disrupts the DOK6 gene and was immediately followed by a repetitive telomere motif, (TTAGGG)(n) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescent in situ hybridisation, the breakpoint in the daughter was found to coincide with the fragile site in the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint region was highly enriched in AT-rich sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is the first report of an aphidicolin-sensitive fragile site that coincides with an in vivo chromosome truncation in the progeny </plain></SENT>
