<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> was one of the original paradigms of Knudson's two-hit model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> formation, it has become apparent that several genetic events contribute to Wilms <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent research has identified targets and regulators of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> gene, WT1, has uncovered several candidate genes at the second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> locus, WT2, and has identified two familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> loci, FWT1 and FWT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recent discovery of activating beta-catenin mutations in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo> has also implicated the Wnt signaling pathway in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent abnormalities of other loci, including 16q, 1p, and 7p, have indicated that these sites may harbor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An enhanced understanding of these and other genetic lesions will provide the foundation for novel targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
