<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting (LOI) through loss (LOM) or gain (GOM) of methylation is involved in many human disorders and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The imprinted 11p15 region is crucial for the control of foetal growth and LOI at this locus is implicated in two clinically opposite disorders: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) with foetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> associated with an enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> risk and Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) with intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, only a few studies have assessed multilocus LOM in human imprinting diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate multilocus LOI syndrome, we studied the methylation status of five maternally and two paternally methylated loci in a large series (n = 167) of patients with 11p15-related foetal growth disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 9.5% of RSS and 24% of BWS patients showed multilocus LOM at regions other than ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> 11p15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, over two third of multilocus LOM RSS patients also had LOM at a second paternally methylated locus, DLK1/GTL2 IG-DMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No additional clinical features due to LOM of other loci were found suggesting an (epi)dominant effect of the 11p15 LOM on the clinical phenotype for this series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, four patients displayed LOM at both ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of them had a RSS and one a BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show for the first time that multilocus LOM can also concern RSS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LOM can involve both paternally and maternally methylated loci in the same patient </plain></SENT>
