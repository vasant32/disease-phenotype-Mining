<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis offers a powerful alternative to linkage and karyotypic approaches for human chromosome mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A panel of deletion hybrids has been derived by mutagenizing J1, a hamster cell line that stably retains chromosome 11 as its only human DNA, and selecting for loss of MIC1, a surface antigen encoded by a gene in band 11p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unique, self-consistent map was constructed by analyzing the pattern of marker segregation in 22 derivative cells lines; these carry overlapping deletions of 11p13, but selectively retain a segment near the 11p telomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The map orders 35 breakpoints and 36 genetic markers, including 3 antigens, 2 isozymes, 12 cloned genes, and 19 anonymous DNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deletions span the entire short arm, dividing it into more than 20 segments and define a set of reagents that can be used to rapidly locate any newly identified marker on 11p, with greatest resolution in the region surrounding MIC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The approach we demonstrate can be applied to map any mammalian chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test the gene order, we examined somatic cell hybrids from five patients, whose reciprocal translocations bisect band 11p13; these include two translocations associated with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each patient, the markers segregate in telomeric and centromeric groups as predicted by the deletion map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data locate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> gene (AN2) and a recurrent T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> breakpoint (TCL2) in the marker sequence, on opposite sides of MIC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To provide additional support, we have characterized the dosage of DNA markers in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and an 11p15-11pter duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest the following gene order: <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> - (HRAS1, MER2, CTSD, TH/INS/IGF2, H19, D11S32) - (RRM1, D11S1, D11S25, D11S26) - D11S12 - (HBBC, D11S30) - D11S20 - (PTH, CALC) - (LDHA, SAA, TRPH, D11S18, D11S21) - D11S31 - D11S17 - HBVS1 - (FSHB, D11S16) - AN2 - MIC1 - TCL2 - delta J - CAT - MIC4 - D11S9 - D11S14 - ACP2 - (D11S33, 14L) - CEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have used the deletion map to show the distribution on 11p of two centromeric repetitive elements and the low-order interspersed repeat A36Fc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide evidence for an allelic segregation event in the hamster genome that underlies the stability of chromosome 11 in J1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The deletion map provides a basis to position <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> loci on 11p, to distinguish the pattern of recessive mutations in different forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and, since many of these genes have been mapped in other mammalian species, to study the evolution of a conserved syntenic group </plain></SENT>
