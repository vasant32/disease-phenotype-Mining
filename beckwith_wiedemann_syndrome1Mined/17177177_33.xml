<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinting is defined as the parental allele-specific expression of a very limited set of genes (about 50-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This regulation depends upon an epigenetic marking of parental alleles during gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monoallelic expression ensures that the levels of the proteins encoded by imprinted genes, important factors of embryonic growth, placental growth or adult metabolism, are assured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Without precise control of their expression, developmental abnormalities result, as is shown by a number of hereditary over-growth syndromes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regulation of imprinted genes is largely dependent on methylation marks, which are laid down during embryological development of germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once in place, the methylation status of precise chromosomal regions, Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), is read by either of two mechanisms, chromatin barrier formation or untranslated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, thereby ensuring that only the maternal or paternal allele is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each imprinted gene is classified as maternal or paternal according to the expressed allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stability of the marked regions in somatic cells is maintained through each cellular replication by a methylation enzyme complex containing Dnmt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the major reading mechanisms of imprinted status are known, chromatin boundary formation by CTCF and untranslated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, the molecules elaborating the initial ICR methylation, are just being uncovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Mis</z:e>-regulation of imprinted gene expression (loss of imprinting [LOI]) is seen frequently and precociously in a large variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, making LOI a potentially valuable tool for both diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, LOI is presently considered the most abundant and most precocious alteration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present review proposes a mechanism responsible for LOI, as well as its eventual value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> diagnosis and prognosis </plain></SENT>
