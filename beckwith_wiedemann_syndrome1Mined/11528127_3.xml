<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomics is a superior way to identify phylogenetically conserved features like genes or regions involved in gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The comparison of extended orthologous chromosomal regions should also reveal other characteristic traits essential for chromosome or gene function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have sequenced and compared a region of conserved synteny from human chromosome 11p15.3 and mouse chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human, this region is known to contain several genes involved in the development of various disorders like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the neighboring chromosome region 11p15.5 extensive imprinting of genes has been reported which might extend to region 11p15.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis of approximately 730 kb in human and 620 kb in mouse led to the identification of eleven genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> putative genes found in the mouse DNA were also present in the same order and orientation in the human chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the human DNA one putative gene of unknown function could be identified which is not present in the orthologous position of the mouse chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sequence similarity between human and mouse is higher in transcribed and exon regions than in non-transcribed segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dot plot analysis, however, reveals a surprisingly well-conserved sequence similarity over the entire analyzed region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the positions of CpG islands, short regions of very high GC content in the 5' region of putative genes, are similar in human and mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With respect to base composition, two distinct segments of significantly different GC content exist as well in human as in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With a GC content of 45% the one segment would correspond to "isochore H1" and the other segment (39% GC in human, 40% GC in mouse) to "isochore L1/L2" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The gene density (one gene per 66 kb) is slightly higher than the average calculated for the complete human genome (one gene per 90 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the number and distribution of repetitive elements shows that the proportion of human DNA made up by interspersed repeats (43.8%) is significantly higher than in the corresponding mouse DNA (30.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This partly explains why the human DNA is longer between the landmark genes used to define the orthologous positions in human and mouse </plain></SENT>
