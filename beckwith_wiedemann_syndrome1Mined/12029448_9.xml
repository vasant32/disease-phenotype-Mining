<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Growth is a complex process which is in part genetically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among other genetic causes, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), the exceptional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of two homologous chromosomes from only one parent, may occasionally be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent insights have revealed that the molecular basis for the clinical features of UPD are specific human genes that are only monoallelically active, depending on whether they are located on the paternal or maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UPD will lead to an imbalanced expression of these imprinted genes and cause abnormal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, specific syndromes have been found to be associated with UPD, these include Prader-Willi syndrome (maternal UPD15/mUPD15), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (paternal UPD15/pUPD15), (transient) neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (pUPD6), Silver-Russell syndrome (mUPD7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (pUPD11) and the mUPD14 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among other features, most of these syndromes are also characterised by growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, UPDs of further chromosomes have been described in growth restricted patients without additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo>; however, a conclusive association between the UPD and the clinical features remains to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: in this review we propose a set of reasons for testing of specific <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> other than 15 in growth restricted patients </plain></SENT>
