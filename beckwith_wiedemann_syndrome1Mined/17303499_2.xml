<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more conservative approach is now possible since the separation of the disease into a nonrecurring focal form, which is cured by partial surgery, and a diffuse form, which necessitates total pancreas removal only in cases of medical treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the disease is now divided into K-channel disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, familial [HHF] 1 and 2), which can mandate surgery, and other metabolic causes, HHF 3 to 6, which are treated medically in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diffuse form is inherited as a recessive gene on chromosome 11, whereas most cases of the focal form are caused by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor 1 defect inherited from the father, which is associated with a loss of heterozygosity on the corresponding part of the mother's chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rare bifocal forms result from a maternal loss of heterozygosity specific to each focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paternal disomy of chromosome 11 is a rare cause of a condition similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A preoperative PET scan with fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine and perioperative frozen-section confirmation are the types of studies done before surgery when needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adult variants of the disease are less well defined at the present time </plain></SENT>
