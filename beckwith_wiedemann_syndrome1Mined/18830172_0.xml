<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it presents a high prevalence within the genetic pathologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This syndrome presents typical manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, macrosomy at birth, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> and defects of the anterior abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
