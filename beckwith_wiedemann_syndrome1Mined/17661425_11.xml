<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variety of alterations occur in chromosomal DNA, many of which can be detected using high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include deletions and duplications (assessed by observing changes in copy number) and regions of homozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis of SNP data from trios can provide an additional category of information about the nature and origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns, including <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), loss of transmitted allele (LTA), and nonparental relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of SNPtrio is to locate regions of uniparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (UPI) and Mendelian inconsistency (MI), identify the type (paternal vs. maternal, iso- vs. hetero-), and assess the associated statistical probability of occurrence by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPtrio's schema permits the identification of hemizygous or homozygous deletions as well as UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We validated the performance of SNPtrio on three platforms (Affymetrix 10 K and 100 K arrays and Illumina 550 K arrays) using SNP data obtained from DNA samples of patients known to have UPD and diagnosed with Prader-Willi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Angelman</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo>, and a complex chromosome 2 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further validated SNPtrio using DNA from patients previously shown to have microdeletions that were verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNPtrio successfully identified previously known UPD and deletion regions, and generated associated probability values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNPtrio analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>) cases and their parents permitted identification of the parent of origin of the extra chromosomal copy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SNPtrio is freely accessible at http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/SNPtrio.htm (Last accessed: 20 June 2007) </plain></SENT>
