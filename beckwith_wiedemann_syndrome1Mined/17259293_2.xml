<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) reflects the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the mechanism which by default leads to the deregulation of genes located at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have demonstrated an association between omphalocoele and CDKN1C/p57 mutations or hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> 11 (pUPD11) has been described only in the mosaic condition with both uniparental and biparental cell lines, and no association with omphalocoele has been pointed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two cases are presented here, in which a paternal segmental UPD11 was detected by molecular investigation of amniotic fluid cell cultures after the presence of apparently isolated omphalocoele was revealed in the fetuses by ultrasound scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies were performed on additional autoptic feto-placental tissues to characterise the distribution of the uniparental cell line and to unmask any biparental lineage in order to document in more detail the as yet unreported association between omphalocoele and pUPD11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results on the UPD distribution profile showed that the abdominal organs have a predominant uniparental constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This condition could mimic the effect of CDKN1C/p57 inactivation, causing the omphalocoele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: New genotype-phenotype correlations emerge from the investigated cases, suggesting that molecular analysis be extended to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with fetal omphalocoele in order to establish the incidence of pUPD11 in complete BWS and in monosymptomatic/mild forms </plain></SENT>
