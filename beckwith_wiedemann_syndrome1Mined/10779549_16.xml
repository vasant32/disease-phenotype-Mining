<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In both human and mouse, the Igf2 gene, localized on chromosomes 11 and 7, respectively, is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome in the majority of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) plays an important role in embryonic growth, and aberrant IGF2 expression has been documented in several human pathologies, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), and a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human and mouse genetic data strongly implicate another gene, CDKN1C (p57(kip2)), located in the same imprinted gene cluster on human chromosome II, in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p57(KIP2) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in CDKN1C (p57(kip2)) have been identified in a small proportion of patients with BWS, and removal of the gene from mice by targeted mutagenesis produces a phenotype with elements in common with this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with BWS with biallelic expression of IGF2 or with a CDKN1C (p57(kip2)) mutation, as well as overlapping phenotypes observed in two types of mutant mice, the p57(kip2) knockout and IGF-II-overexpressing mice, strongly suggest that the genes may act in a common pathway of growth control in situations where Igf2 expression is abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show that p57(kip2) expression is reduced on IGF-II treatment of primary embryo fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, p57(kip2) expression is down-regulated in mice with high serum levels of IGF-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the effects of increased IGF-II in BWS may, in part, be mediated through a decrease in p57(kip2) gene expression </plain></SENT>
