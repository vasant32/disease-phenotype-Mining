<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central members in the growth axes are regulated epigenetically and thereby reflect the profound significance of imprinting for correct mammalian ontogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prominent imprinting disorder, Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> characterized by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> and other features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SRS represents the first human disorder with imprinting dis-turbances affecting two different chromosomes: nearly one tenth of patients carry a maternal unipa-rental disomy of chromosome 7 and more than 38% show a hypomethylation in the imprinting control region 1 in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, hypermethylation of the same region is associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), thus SRS and BWS can be regarded as genetically (and clinically) opposite diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the different imprinting regions involved, SRS is a suitable model to decipher the role of imprinting in growth and the functional interaction between imprinted genes in different genomic regions </plain></SENT>
