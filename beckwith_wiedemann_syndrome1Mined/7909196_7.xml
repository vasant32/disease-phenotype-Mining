<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The putative locus of the gene responsible for this syndrome is assigned to chromosome region 11p15.5, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in this region has been proposed: the paternally derived gene(s) at 11p15.5 is selectively expressed, while the maternally transmitted gene(s) is inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 18 patients for the parental origin of their 11p15 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA polymorphism analyses using 6 loci on chromosome 11 showed that 2 patients with duplications of 11p15 regions from their respective fathers and one from the mother, indicating the transmission of an excessive paternal gene at 11p15 to each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results, together with the previous findings in karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal patients and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> mouse experiments, are consistent with imprinting hypothesis that overexpression of paternally derived gene(s) at 11p15.5, probably the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene, may cause the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total constitutional uniparental paternal disomy (UPD) or segmental UPD for the 6 loci examined of chromosome 11 was not observed in our 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to explain completely the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of this syndrome in patients with various chromosomal constitutions, we propose an alternative imprinting mechanism involving the other locus that may be paternally imprinted and may suppress the expression of this gene </plain></SENT>
