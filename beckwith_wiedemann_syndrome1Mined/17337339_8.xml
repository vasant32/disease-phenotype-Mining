<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 20% of BWS cases have <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such cases appear to result from mitotic recombination occurring in early embryogenesis and offer a rare opportunity to study mitotic recombination in nonneoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a cohort of 52 children with BWS and UPD using a panel of microsatellite markers for chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases demonstrated mosaic paternal isodisomy, and IGF2 and H19 were included in the segment of UPD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of segmental disomy was variable, with no evidence of clustering of the proximal UPD breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most cases (92% of those informative) UPD did not involve 11q, but 4 patients demonstrated UPD for the whole of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to meiotic recombination, the mitotic recombination frequency did not decline near the centromere </plain></SENT>
