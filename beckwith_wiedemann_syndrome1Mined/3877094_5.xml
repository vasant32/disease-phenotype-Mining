<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation examines the natural history of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> associated with a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and its influence on dentofacial development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Facial skeletal growth and tongue size were assessed by analyzing cephalometric radiographs from age 2 months to 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with cephalometric norms and new normative data derived from 13 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major influence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> was protrusion of dentoalveolar structures, particularly in the lower jaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an anterior cross-bite in the primary dentition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, an abnormally obtuse gonial angle was observed increasing the effective length of the mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tongue size in BWS was generally greater than the norm, but the increase with age paralleled the mean growth curve of the tongue in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over time the base of the tongue became longer and the hyoid bone moved posteriorly and inferiorly, allowing for accommodation of the tongue within the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes in tongue shape and dentofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> support the position that early partial glossectomy should be delayed or abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases where tongue reduction is considered necessary, the new cephalometric normative data on tongue size provided herein can be used to establish objective criteria for such surgery </plain></SENT>
