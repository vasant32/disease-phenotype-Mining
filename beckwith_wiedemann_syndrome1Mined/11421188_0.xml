<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression is thus monoallelic, with one parental allele being expressed, the other silenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinting implies the existence of a reversible imprinting signal, which is erased in the gonads to be reset according to the sex of the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in imprinted genes are not inherited in a regular Mendelian fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of identified imprinted genes is now around 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three congenital human disorders are known to be caused by errors in the expression pattern of imprinted genes: Prader-Willi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Angelman</z:e> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
