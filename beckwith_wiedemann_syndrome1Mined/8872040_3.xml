<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a new case of 11p15 duplication (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11p15) in a boy (46,XY,-21,+der(21), t(11;21)(p15.2;q22.3)] suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), whose phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> father carries a balanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 21[46,XY, t(11;21)(p15.2;q22.3)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paternal grandmother has the same balanced translocation and is also clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BWS was suspected when the boy was 6 months old because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, ear lobe creases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distention</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from the characteristic BWS phenotype, the boy has other features which are almost exclusively observed in 11p <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000348'>high forehead</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002236'>frontal upsweep of hair</z:hpo>, wide central nose bridge, slightly beaked nose, chubby cheeks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far, at least eight cases of 11p15 duplication have been described as patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six of these, the duplication was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a translocated or rearranged paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was also the case in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the two other previously published cases, the 11p15 duplications were de novo, but in one of these, DNA analysis has subsequently shown that the duplication was of paternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We discuss our observations in relation to the above-mentioned previous cases of 11p15 duplication and the possible role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in the etiology of BWS </plain></SENT>
