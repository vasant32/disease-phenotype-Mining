<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cloning of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> gene, WT1, in 1989, laid the framework for a model but also emphasized the underlying genetic complexity of this embryonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">kidney cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite longstanding evidence for additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> gene loci, by 1997 very few of these have been cloned and none has yet been proven to be involved in Wilms <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the potential biological properties of these candidate genes suggest that disregulation of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, such as insulin-like growth factor 2, may be pivotal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nephrogenesis is clearly sufficiently flexible to absorb many genetic errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At present, it is unclear how often a simple two mutation model may account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding how the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> genes interrelate, if indeed they do, awaits their identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Piecing together these pathways may eventually lead to logical targets for therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
