<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an effective single intraoral, minimally invasive technique to reduce the <z:mp ids='MP_0009906'>enlarged tongue</z:mp> base in children with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present the anatomic dissection of fresh cadavers and a representative case series of children who underwent submucosal minimally invasive lingual excision (SMILE) with a plasma-mediated radiofrequency device (coblation) under intraoral ultrasonic and endoscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple anatomic dissections determined the relative location of the hypoglossal nerve and lingual neurovascular bundle in relation to removable tongue base musculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pediatric case series demonstrates the straightforward SMILE technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laboratory anatomic dissection and clinical lingual ultrasonography revealed the surgical safety borders for SMILE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical safety and efficacy of SMILE is demonstrated by preoperative and postoperative clinical examinations and polysomnograms in children with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> (such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndromes</z:e> and tongue vascular malformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coblation submucosally removes excessive tongue base tissue through a small anterior tongue incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SMILE was performed without excessive pain, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, or tongue dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SMILE is an effective novel operation that incorporates coblation with ultrasonography and endoscopic guidance for children who need tongue base reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anatomic dissection and clinical cases demonstrate the potential for aggressive yet relatively safe tissue removal by this minimally invasive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SMILE also has significant potential for adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>large tongue</z:hpo> base </plain></SENT>
