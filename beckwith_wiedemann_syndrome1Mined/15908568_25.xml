<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Placental mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (PMD) is a distinct syndrome of unknown aetiology that is associated with significant fetal morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>Intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> is common, yet, paradoxically, many of the associated fetuses/newborns have been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report two cases of PMD with high levels of androgenetic (complete paternal uniparental isodisomy) cells in the placenta and document, in one case, a likely androgenetic contribution to the fetus as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The same haploid paternal complement found in the androgenetic cells was present in coexisting biparental cells, suggesting origin from a single fertilisation event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preferential allocation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells into the trophoblast explains the absence of trophoblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, a key feature of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the distribution of androgenetic cells appears to differ from that reported for artificially created androgenetic mouse chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Androgenetic mosaicism for the first time provides an aetiology for PMD, and may be a novel mechanism for BWS and unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
