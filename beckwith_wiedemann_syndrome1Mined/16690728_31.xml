<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conclusive evidence of an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> exists for only a minority of these conditions, including WT1 associated syndromes, familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e>, and certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In many reported conditions the rare co-occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> is probably due to chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, for several conditions the available evidence cannot either confirm or exclude an increased risk, usually because of the rarity of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, emerging evidence suggests that an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> occurs only in a subset of individuals for some syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complex clinical and molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of disorders associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e>, together with the apparent absence of functional links between most of the known predisposition genes, suggests that abrogation of a variety of pathways can promote Wilms <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
