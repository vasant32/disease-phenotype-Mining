<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In 9-17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients a predisposing syndrome is present, in particular WT1-associated syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constitutional WT1 mutations or epigenetic changes on chromosome 11p15 have also been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> does not exclude the presence of a genetic predisposition, suggesting that more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients may have a constitutional abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the frequency of constitutional aberrations in combination with phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS &amp; METHODS: Clinical genetic assessment, as well as molecular analysis of WT1 and locus 11p15 was offered to a single-centre cohort of 109 childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (11%) had a WT1 aberration and eight patients (8%) had an 11p15 aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients with a WT1 aberration, four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WAGRO">WAGR syndrome</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, genitourinary malformations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>), one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0950121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Denys-Drash syndrome</z:e>, four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">genitourinary anomalies</z:e> without other syndromic features and three had bilateral disease with stromal-predominant histology at young age without congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients with an 11p15 aberration, four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), two had minor features of BWS and two had no stigmata of BWS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Constitutional WT1 or 11p15 aberrations are frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients and careful clinical assessment can identify the majority of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we would recommend offering clinical genetic counselling to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients, as well as molecular analysis to patients with clinical signs of a syndrome or with features that may indicate a constitutional WT1 or 11p15 aberration </plain></SENT>
