<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, imprinted genes are an example of non-Mendelian genetics, in which only one member of the gene pair is expressed and expression is determined by the parent of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes may account for 0.1-1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 50 imprinted genes have been identified in humans, and imprinted genes frequently cluster under the control of an imprinting center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many imprinted genes contribute to growth, either as growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>), or as growth inhibitors, such as the GRB10 gene in Russell-Silver syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes have evolved over time in mammals to fine-tune the growth of the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paternally expressed genes generally enhance growth, whereas maternally expressed genes appear to suppress growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and loss of heterozygosity contribute to a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A common process for controlling gene activity is methylation, which can be changed during male or female gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examples of classic human disorders related to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (chromosome 11), Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (chromosome 15), Russell-Silver syndrome (chromosome 7), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033806" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Albright hereditary osteodystrophy</z:e> (chromosome 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several of these disorders are discussed and illustrated </plain></SENT>
