<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He showed subtle signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The boy also had <z:mp ids='MP_0002286'>cryptorchism</z:mp> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In his first months of life, variant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome</z:e> was tentatively suspected and he was included in a careful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> prevention program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the age of 11 months, bifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> of the left eye was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010799'>Pinealoma</z:hpo> was suspected at the age of 19 months and was removed by neurosurgery at the age of 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 years and 4 months, the deletion of the RB1 gene was suspected on clinical grounds and was diagnosed by FISH and molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At that time, he was a near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy playful kindergarten child, height 107 cm (-0.3 SD), OFC 52.5 cm (+0.8 SD), developmental age 3-3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010799'>pinealoma</z:hpo>, and deletion of the RB1 gene diagnosed by FISH has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The deletion spans at least 370-420 kb in size and is predicted to include proximal and distal neighbor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This report may assist in establishing the clinical signs of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo> at the RB1 locus on 13q14 </plain></SENT>
