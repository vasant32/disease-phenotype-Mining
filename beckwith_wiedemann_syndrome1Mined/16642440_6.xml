<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the gene encoding ASM (SMPD1) is paternally imprinted and that differential expression of the mutant alleles in patients with ASM-deficient NPD and in carriers influences the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the results of genomic sequencing versus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction sequencing for several patients with NPD revealed preferential expression of one mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of one family showed that the expressed allele was maternally inherited and that the distinct clinical presentations of the individual patients were correlated with the amount of residual ASM activity expressed from the maternal mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of NPD cell lines with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> enhanced the expression of the paternal SMPD1 allele, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing identified which CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> within the SMPD1 promoter were methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a related set of studies, we identified a carrier individual who had approximately 15% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ASM activity and clinical features of ASM-deficient NPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing confirmed that this individual carried a single SMPD1 mutation and that this mutant allele was preferentially expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data thus demonstrate, for the first time, imprinting at the SMPD1 gene and reveal the influence of this epigenetic modification on the presentation of ASM-deficient NPD </plain></SENT>
