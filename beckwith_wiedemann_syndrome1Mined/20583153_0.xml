<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a boy with three cell lines: 46,XY, r(11)(p15.5,q25)[90]/45,XY,-11 [8]/47,XY, r(11)(p15.5,q25)x2[2], with minor anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> who developed asynchronous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo> (WTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) performed on peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient led to the identification of a constitutional duplication of 4.8 Mb at 11p15.5-11p15.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This duplication was found to involve the chromosome of paternal origin, and occurred in tandem on the ring chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the constitutive duplication of the paternal 11p15 chromosome region, the patient showed no sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular characterization of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> was consistent with their independent origin and showed that they arose from the two distinct cellular clones with the ring chromosome, indicating that this anomaly is likely to have caused the patient's susceptibility to WT development </plain></SENT>
