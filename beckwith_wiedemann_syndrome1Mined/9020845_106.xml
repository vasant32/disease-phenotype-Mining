<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and others have identified three imprinted human genes on 11p15.5, IGF2, H19, and p57KIP2, although the latter gene is separated by 700 kb from the other two, and it is unclear whether there are other imprinted genes within this large interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously mapped an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumour</z:e> suppressor gene to this region, as well as five balanced germline chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a condition characterized by prenatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We isolated the upstream exons of the previously identified gene KVLQT1, which causes the familial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> long-QT (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that KVLQT1 spans much of the interval between p57KIP2 and IGF2, and that it is also imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the gene is disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in BWS patients, as well as by a balanced chromosomal translocation in an embryonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rhabdoid tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the lack of parent-of-origin effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> syndrome appears to be due to relative lack of imprinting in the affected tissue, cardiac muscle, representing a novel mechanism for variable penetrance of a human disease gene </plain></SENT>
