<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some properties of the imprinting mechanism are already established; notably, some of the effects of imprinting on mammalian development can be explained by the phenotypic effects of a number of specific imprinted genes, which include major fetal growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An evolutionary explanation of imprinting has also been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the molecular mechanisms of imprinting are known, and these include the modification of DNA and chromosomes in the form of DNA methylation and possibly heritable chromatin structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting or altered imprinting is implicated in a large number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many important issues remain to be resolved; these include the precise molecular mechanisms and, in particular, the nature of the primary imprints that are inherited from the parental gametes, and the genes that control the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolation of the majority of imprinted genes and the elucidation of their phenotypic effects and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> are major goals for the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies will provide important insights into human genetics, and will connect evolutionary understanding with <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> and human behaviour </plain></SENT>
