<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> is a mechanism that regulates expression or repression of genes according to their parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic expression of imprinted genes is therefore dependent on whether the gene was inherited from the father or the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More than 20 imprinted genes in man are recognized, and these genes tend to occur in clusters in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best characterized imprinted regions are the 15q11-13 region which involves Prader-Willi's syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> and the 11p15 region involving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e>'s syndrome </plain></SENT>
