<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present case study was to determine the long-term impact of partial glossectomy (using the keyhole technique) on overall speech intelligibility and articulation in a Dutch-speaking child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the present study is meant as a contribution to the further delineation of the phonation, resonance, articulation and language characteristics and oral behaviour in a child with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed information on the speech and language characteristics of children with BWS may lead to better guidance of pediatric management programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The child's speech was assessed 9 years after partial glossectomy with regard to ENT characteristics, overall intelligibility (perceptual consensus evaluation), articulation (phonetic and phonological errors), voice (videostroboscopy, vocal quality), resonance (perceptual, nasometric assessment), language (expressive and receptive) and oral behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo>, an anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000699'>diastema</z:hpo>, overangulation of lower incisors and an enlarged but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> symmetric shaped tongue were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall speech intelligibility improved from severely impaired (presurgical) to slightly impaired (5 months post-glossectomy) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (9 years postoperative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative phonetic inventory showed a remarkable improvement of articulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine years post-glossectomy three types of distortions seemed to predominate: a rhotacism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233728" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sigmatism</z:e> and the substitution of the alveolar /z/ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral behaviour, vocal characteristics and resonance were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but problems with expressive syntactic abilities were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term impact of partial glossectomy, using the keyhole technique (preserving the vascularity and the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> input of the remaining intrinsic tongue muscles), on speech intelligibility, articulation, and oral behaviour in this Dutch-speaking child with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> can be regarded as successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is not clear how these expressive syntactical problems demonstrated in this child can be explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Certainly they are not part of a more general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260662" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hearing problems</z:e> or cognitive malfunctioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To what extent the presence of expressive syntactical problems is a possible aspect of the phenotypic spectrum of children with BWS is subject for further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple variables, both known and unknown can affect the long-term outcome after partial glossectomy in a child with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The timing and type of the surgical technique, hearing and cognitive functioning are known variables in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>But variables such as children's motivation, the contribution of the motor-oriented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460,C0699719,C0037831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Finding" abbrv="">speech therapy</z:e>, the parental articulation input and stimulation and other family, school and community factors are unknown and are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors which can influence speech outcome after partial glossectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Detailed analyses in a greater number of subjects with BWS may help further illustrate the long-term impact of partial glossectomy </plain></SENT>
