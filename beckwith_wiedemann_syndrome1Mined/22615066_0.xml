<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using DNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, SNuPE, pyrosequencing, and hybridization to the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Panel 1 array, we characterized the genomic DNA of two brothers with BWS who were discordant for loss of methylation at several differentially methylated regions (DMR), including imprinting center 2 (IC2) on chromosome band 11p15.5, which is often hypomethylated in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In keeping with MMHS, the elder child had hypomethylation of SGCE and PLAGL1 as well as of IC2, whereas the younger brother demonstrated no loss of methylation at these DMRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although this discordance is consistent with the observation that 15-20% of individuals with BWS do not have detectable genetic or epigenetic alterations of 11p15.5, this is the first report of familial recurrence of BWS with discordance for chromosomal 11p15.5 alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that this apparent discordance arises either from mosaicism precluding identification of IC2 hypomethylation in blood or buccal mucosa DNA of the younger child, or from hypomethylation at a site not interrogated by our molecular studies </plain></SENT>
