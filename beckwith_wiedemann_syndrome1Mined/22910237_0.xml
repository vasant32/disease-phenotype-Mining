<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with nephron sparing surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> in this population at risk for metachronous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with a predisposing syndrome who underwent nephrectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> during a 10-year period (2000 to 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data collected included age, mode of detection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, treatment, pathology results, followup time and recurrence episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, 13 of 75 (19%) patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> were diagnosed with predisposing syndrome(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were treated and had a mean age at diagnosis of 27 months (range 7 months to 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, isolated hemihyperplasia, WAGR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>Aniridia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000119'>Genitourinary abnormalities</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental Retardation</z:hpo>) syndrome and isolated 11p13 deletion were the underlying diagnoses in 3, 2, 2 and 1 patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients were diagnosed by screening ultrasound and 5 underwent preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at surgery was 2.5 cm (range 1 to 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nephron sparing surgery was performed in 6 of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathological study showed favorable histology <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100880'>nephrogenic rests</z:hpo> in 6 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a mean followup of 36 months (range 6 to 72) no recurrences were documented and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nephron sparing surgery appears safe for patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> associated with predisposing syndrome(s), allowing for the preservation of renal function and good oncologic outcomes for the available followup time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If more studies confirm our observation, current recommendations for the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> may need to reemphasize the value of attempting nephron sparing surgery in this patient population </plain></SENT>
