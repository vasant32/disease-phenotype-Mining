<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The clinical importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes in the pediatric patient population has been increasingly recognized during the past decade, but clinical overlap among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes often makes diagnostic categorization difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in the molecular delineation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes in recent years have furthered our knowledge of the phenotypic spectrum of this group of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on developments in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and phenotype-genotype correlations in the two most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings with respect to clinical diagnosis, medical management, and genetic counseling are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Recent reports have redefined the cardinal clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e>, and the identification of two distinct types of molecular alterations in patients with this syndrome has enabled assessment of phenotype-genotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> have further expanded our understanding of the causative molecular mechanisms of this condition and provide evidence for specific genotype-phenotype correlations, most notably with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Recognition of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and investigation of diagnostic causes is important in anticipating appropriate medical management and facilitating the provision of genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New developments in our understanding of the molecular basis and phenotypic expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes provide additional tools in this often challenging process </plain></SENT>
