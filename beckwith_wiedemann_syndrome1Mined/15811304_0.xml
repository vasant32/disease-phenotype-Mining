<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was discovered 20 years ago and the aim of this review is to summarize its main characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nature of the imprint, still unknown, is characterized by differential chromatin structure and DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The imprint is reset at each generation during gametogenesis, which can be observed by demethylation in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGCs</z:chebi>, then gamete-specific remethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imprinted genes are usually located in clusters and regulated by cis sequences such as imprinting centres, trans factors such as the insulator protein CTCF and/or large non coding antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of the imprinted clusters can lead to human diseases such as Prader-Willi, Angelman or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
