<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 20-year retrospective study was performed to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> who underwent tongue reduction surgery at the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A literature review was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was indicated and carried out in 23 patients with a yearly average varying from 0 to 3 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary indications for surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> included significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>tongue protrusion</z:hpo> in 30% (n=7), and a combination of clinical problems in 70% (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the procedure was performed by the same surgeon using an anterior, V-shaped, wedge resection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had direct postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> was observed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reported clinical outcome during follow-up demonstrated a satisfactory resting tongue position in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature demonstrated variability in surgical indications and techniques, and postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
