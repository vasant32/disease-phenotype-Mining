<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine human imprinting syndromes have been identified but current evidence links ART with only three: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and the newly described maternal hypomethylation syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is currently a lack of evidence linking ART with the remaining six imprinting syndromes: Prader-Willi syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, maternal and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 14, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> type 1b and transient neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence from clinical reports suggests that the association between imprinting syndromes and ART may be restricted to syndromes where the imprinting change takes the form of hypomethylation on the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, studies of gametes and early embryos suggest that ART can be associated with hypermethylation as well as hypomethylation, with imprinting changes occurring on paternal as well as maternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The health effects of ART-associated imprinting changes may also extend beyond the nine recognized imprinting syndromes </plain></SENT>
