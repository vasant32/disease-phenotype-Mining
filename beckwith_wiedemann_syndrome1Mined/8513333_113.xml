<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here, by exploiting sequence polymorphisms in exon nine of the human insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, that only the paternally-inherited allele is active in embryonic and extra-embryonic cells from first trimester pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, only the paternal allele is expressed in tissues from a patient who suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the parental imprinting of IGF2 appears to be evolutionarily conserved from mouse to man and has implications for the generation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
