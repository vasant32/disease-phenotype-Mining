<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a striking incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> found in BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various lines of investigation have localized "imprinted" genes involved in BWS and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> to 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High resolution mapping of 8 rare balanced chromosomal BWS rearrangements enabled us to identify three distinct regions on chromosome 11p15 that might harbor genes involved in the above-mentioned disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> that correlates with the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> seen in the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expressed candidate gene sequences from these regions have been cloned and partly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These transcripts are either disrupted by or are at least within a few kb of these BWS chromosome breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So far, zinc-finger sequences and one Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain were found in independent candidate genes which are compatible with a regulating function of growth promoting genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abundance of expression of these genes varies from low abundant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult and fetal tissues tested to detectable on Northern blots of adult tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to our 11p15 studies we have analyzed additional chromosome regions, in particular 1p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies have identified 1p35 as a region of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A positional cloning effort to identify a balanced 1p35 translocation found in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> has led to the isolation of a YAC, crossing this breakpoint </plain></SENT>
