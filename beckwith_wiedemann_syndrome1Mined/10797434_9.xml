<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the occurrence of asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> suggests that mosaicism has some role in the WBS phenotype, no direct evidence for this has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WBS is a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> linked to the imprinted gene cluster on chromosome region 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed a molecular survey of multiple organs and tissues in a case of WBS with a high degree of mosaic paternal 11p15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The organs most severely affected were those with the highest percentage of cells with UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular there was a striking difference in the degree of mosaicism for 11p15 UPD between the extremely enlarged left adrenal and non-enlarged right adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the proportion of paternal 11p15 UPD cells correlates with the tissue phenotype of WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that high proportions of abnormal cells result from a combination of stochastic events and cell selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> including hemihyperplasia and predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> in WBS patients </plain></SENT>
