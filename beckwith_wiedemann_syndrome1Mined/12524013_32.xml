<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imprinting diseases are characterised by complex patterns of mutations and associated phenotypes affecting pre- and postnatal growth and neurological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regulation of imprinted gene expression is mediated by allele-specific epigenetic modifications of DNA and chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These modifications preferentially affect central regulatory elements that control in cis over long distances allele-specific expression of several neighbouring genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigations of imprinting diseases have a strong impact on biomedical research and provide interesting models for function and mechanisms of epigenetic gene control </plain></SENT>
