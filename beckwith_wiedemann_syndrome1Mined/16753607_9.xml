<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is clinicopathologically distinct with high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (IUGR) and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study presents 11 new PMD cases and provides a meta-analysis of the associated IUGR and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were identified between 1971 and 2005, mostly from consultation files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, 71 PMD cases have previously been reported; 15 of these were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the addition of our new results, among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases without BWS, 50% had IUGR and 43% had intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Females represented 82% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, PMD is associated with high IUGR and IUFD/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> rates and disproportionally affects females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause and pathogenesis are yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current understanding and hypotheses involving PMD are discussed </plain></SENT>
