<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As little information is available on the molecular basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development in IH, or on the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in children with different molecular subtypes of IH, molecular testing was undertaken on 51 patients with IH and revealed: 8 (16%) with UPD, 3 (6%) with hypomethylation at KCNQ1OT1, and 0 with hypermethylation at H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients with UPD, 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastomas</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>); 0/3 patients with hypomethylation at KCNQ1OT1 had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>; of the remaining 40 with no molecular alterations, 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0008256'>adrenocortical adenoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 50% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> frequency in patients with IH and UPD was statistically significantly higher than the 15% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> frequency in those with IH and no molecular alteration detected (Fisher's exact test P = 0.047, OR 5.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that UPD at 11p15 in patients with IH confers a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk than in patients with IH without this molecular change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, two of the eight patients with UPD and IH were conceived using assisted reproductive technologies (ART), thus raising the question whether ART might impact the rate of somatic recombination during embryonic development </plain></SENT>
