<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes play important roles in the regulation of growth and development, and several have been shown to influence behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their allele-specific expression depends on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> from either the mother or the father, and is regulated by "imprinting control regions" (ICRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ICRs are controlled by DNA methylation, which is present on one of the two parental alleles only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These allelic methylation marks are established in either the female or the male germline, following the erasure of preexisting DNA methylation in the primordial germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After fertilization, the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> somatic cells of the developing embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This epigenetic "life cycle" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>Hydatidiform mole</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the neurodevelopmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e>, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that assisted reproduction technologies (ART) can sometimes affect the epigenetic cycle of imprinting as well, and that this gives rise to imprinting disease syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding warrants careful monitoring of the epigenetic effects, and absolute risks, of currently used and novel reproduction technologies </plain></SENT>
