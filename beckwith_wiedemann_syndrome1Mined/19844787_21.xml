<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes represent only a small subset of mammalian genes that are present but not imprinted in other vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic imprints are erased in both germlines and reset accordingly; thus, reversible depending on the parent of origin and leads to differential expression in the course of development </plain></SENT>
