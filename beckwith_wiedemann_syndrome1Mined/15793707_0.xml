<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> is not limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, and the surgical indication for obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors performed polysomnography for the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Overnight polysomnograms were obtained in 2 patients who developed obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> after 1-stage repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE 1: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>Apnea</z:hpo> index (AI), defined as apneic events per hour, indicated 17.3, and SpO2 below 95% occupied 80% of the total sleep time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated obstruction of the airway between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> and the hypopharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Central tongue resection and the division of the frenulum linguae for associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010296'>ankyloglossia</z:hpo> were performed 97 days after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One month after surgery, apneic events disappeared and SpO2 below 95% occupied only 1% of the total sleep time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CASE 2: Obstructive AI indicated 28.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Division of the frenulum linguae and anterior glossopexy were performed 55 days after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative polysomnogram indicated a marked reduction of AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that polysomnography was useful for evaluating obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and that advancement of the tongue by division of the frenulum linguae may be recommended for the treatment of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
