<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator works by binding the zinc-finger protein CTCF in a parent-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation defects involving the ICR1 H19/IGF2 domain result in two growth disorders with opposite phenotypes: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (maternal ICR1 gain of methylation in 10% of BWS cases) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> disorder, the Silver-Russell syndrome (paternal ICR1 loss of methylation in 60% of SRS cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although a few deletions removing part of ICR1 have been described in some familial BWS cases, little information is available regarding the mechanism of ICR1 DNA methylation defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the CTCF gene and the ICR1 domain in 21 BWS patients with ICR1 gain of methylation and 16 SRS patients with ICR1 loss of methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified four constitutional ICR1 genetic defects in BWS patients, including a familial case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of those defects are newly identified imprinting defects consisting of small deletions and a single mutation, which do not involve one of the CTCF binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two of those defects affect OCT-binding sequences which are suggested to maintain the unmethylated state of the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single-nucleotide variation was identified in a SRS patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data extends the spectrum of constitutive genetic ICR1 abnormalities and suggests that extensive and accurate analysis of ICR1 is required for appropriate genetic counseling in BWS patients with ICR1 gain of methylation </plain></SENT>
