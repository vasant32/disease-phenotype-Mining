<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a clinically variable and genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder, providing evidence that imprinted genes play key roles in the control of fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, diagnostic criteria include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo>, neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegalies</z:hpo> and hemihyperplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Component clinical manifestations also include renal abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008186'>adrenocortical cytomegaly</z:hpo> and a characteristic facial appearance, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetically, BWS is associated with disturbances within two different domains on 11p15 that are controlled by distinct imprinting control regions (ICR), ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients have abnormalities within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, loss of maternal methylation accounts for 50-60% of cases, and is associated with reduction in the expression of the CDKN1C gene, a member of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor family acting as negative regulator of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in CDKN1C are detected in another 5-10% of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome deletions affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS We report on a patient with BWS in which a de novo 11p15 deletion was detected by array comparative genomic hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo> and minor physical anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The deletion, that was demonstrated to be maternal in origin by SNP array, encompassed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> and several flanking genes, including CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern of ICR1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS This observation provides evidence that, among the genetic defects associated with BWS, a 11p15 microdeletion encompassing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> identifies a peculiar clinical phenotype, with high recurrence risk in offspring of female carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also supports the model of two independent domains within the BWS locus </plain></SENT>
