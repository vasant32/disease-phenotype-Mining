A case is reported of an infant affected with Sturge-Weber disease who underwent left hemispherectomy due to untreatable seizures when 97 days old. Pathological analysis of the surgical specimens revealed the presence of four-layered microgyric cortex below the angiomatosis, intense gliosis, and the presence of calcifications of both the abnormal cortex and the underlying white matter. These findings suggest that the early infantile form of Sturge-Weber disease is associated with a developmental disorder of the cortical organization. Such abnormalities are consistent with the presence of an epileptogenic condition that is unresponsive to pharmacological treatment.
