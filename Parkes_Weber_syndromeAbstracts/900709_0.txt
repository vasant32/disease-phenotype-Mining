A 53-year-old white man was noted to have bilateral retinitis pigmentosa associated with a left nevus flammeus, a left choroidal hemangioma and unilateral glaucoma. No central nervous system manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome were noted. The association of retinitis pigmentosa and the nevus flammeus is probably a chance occurrence.
