Ten patients are presented who demonstrate a newly recognized association of macrocephaly with unusual angiomatosis and limb asymmetry in three somewhat similar cutaneous vascular disorders: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, the combination of Sturge-Weber anomaly with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, and cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita. The etiology of the macrocephaly in patients with these conditions is unknown. The majority (seven of ten) of these children have no evidence of central nervous system dysfunction.
