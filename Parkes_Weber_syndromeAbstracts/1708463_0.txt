The authors describe a case of choroid plexus hemangioma in a 49-year-old male. Computed tomographic scan showed an isodense mass at the trigone of the right lateral ventricle with homogeneous enhancement. He also displayed a port-wine nevus on the ipsilateral side of the face. At operation, the tumor was found not to adhere to the lateral ventricular wall but to be connected to the choroid plexus, and was colored similarly to the facial nevus. Histological examination showed a capillary hemangioma with many crowded capillaries. This case was not included in the category of Sturge-Weber syndrome but is thought to be closely related, considering the syndrome from the viewpoint of generalized neurocutaneous hemangiomatosis.
