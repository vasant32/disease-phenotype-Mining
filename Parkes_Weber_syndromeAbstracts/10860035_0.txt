This is a case report of two patients, aged 26 and 22, who suffered from congenital hemangioma on their faces and pronounced gingival overgrowth localized parallel to extraoral lesions. Prior to surgical intervention the hygienic conditions were improved in several sessions by means of professional preventive treatment and oral hygiene instructions. Histologic examination of both cases revealed a highly vascularized pattern of pyogenic granuloma. One of the cases was associated with a pregnancy. These patients can be classified as Sturge-Weber syndrome. Postsurgical treatment consisted of efficient plaque control and adequate oral prophylaxis sessions every 3 months. The large gingival overgrowth was not observed to recur in 2 and 4 years, respectively, of follow-up.
