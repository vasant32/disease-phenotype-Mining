A unique association of Sturge-Weber syndrome and atlanto-occipital assimilation is presented. A 18-year-old male was admitted in emergency because of the sudden severe headache and vomiting. He had vascular nevus in the right half of the face at birth and several episodes of generalized convulsive seizures. On admission craniogram demonstrated calcification in the right occipital area. Neurological examination revealed tenderness in the nuchal region, moderate limitation of cervical mobility in a antero-posterior direction, Bruns-Cushing type nystagmus, bilaterally diminished gag reflex, and positive Romberg's test. Spinal tap showed crystal clear CSF with normal pressure. EEG showed paroxysmal slowing focus in the right parieto-occipital area. Polytomography of the craniovertebral junction demonstrated the unilateral atlanto-occipital assimilation on the left associated with the aplasia of the right posterior arch. Myelography was negative. A right carotid angiography disclosed the dilatation of the basal vein of Rosenthal and abnormal venous vasculature. CT-scan demonstrated the calcified region of the right occipital area more distinctly than the plain roentogenogram, but the enhancement study of the leptomeningeal angioma of the Sturge-Weber syndrome was negative. Never been found this rare association in a review of the literature, the authors discussed the clinical and radiological findings of both diseases.
