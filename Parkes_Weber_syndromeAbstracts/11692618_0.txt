 PURPOSE: To investigate by histopathology the cause of secondary glaucoma due to Sturge-Weber syndrome. CASE: A 10-year-old boy with Sturge-Weber syndrome and glaucoma in the right eye is reported. Trabeculectomy was performed because of uncontrolled intraocular pressure and the trabeculectomy specimen was examined histologically by both light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Histological examination of the trabeculectomy specimen showed the ciliary muscle dislocated anteriorly and there was no Schlemm's canal. The spaces in juxtacanalicular connective tissue(JCT) were replaced by vascular structures and connective tissue. There were two kinds of vascular structures, one where the endothelium was surrounded by pericytes and the other where it was not surrounded by pericytes. CONCLUSIONS: Developmental abnormalities of Schlemm's canal and JCT may have caused glaucoma in this case. These observations suggested that development of both mesoderm and neural crest might be involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma due to Sturge-Weber syndrome.
