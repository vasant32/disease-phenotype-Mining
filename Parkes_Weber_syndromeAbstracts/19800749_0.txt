We report a patient with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) who developed migraine-like headaches followed by cerebral infarction. SWS without facial nevus was diagnosed based on calcification detected by CT and pial angioma detected by enhanced MRI. His migraine-like headaches were preceded by left homonymous hemianopsia, which persisted for more than 60 min. Although homonymous hemianopsia disappeared with cessation of the headache until 13 years of age, from age 14 years onward, this homonymous hemianopsia persisted after the headaches ended. Moreover, reduced cerebral blood flow was seen in the right occipital area on SPECT. At first, his left homonymous hemianopsia persisted for several months after the headache disappeared, but it had recovered completely. However, the durations of episodes of left homonymous hemianopsia, which persisted after headache disappearance, gradually became longer. At last one year after his first admission, the visual defect had become permanent. SWS is well known to be associated with migraine attacks and hemianopsia. However, the course of our present patient, i.e. recurrent homonymous hemianopsia, associated with migraine-like headaches becoming permanent, is rare. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this clinical course is uncertain. The efficacy of valproate and propranolol as preventive therapy has been inadequate, to date.
