Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (=flair imaging) is widely used as primary screening sequence in various investigation protocols, due to its high lesion contrast and sensitivity in detection of parenchymatous and leptomeningeal disease. An additional increase of sensitivity for detection of lesions may be achieved by contrast-enhanced flair imaging. Based on flair imaging a dual-echo inversion recovery imaging sequence (=proton echo usage [=protoneus] - sequence) was developed, which could significantly extend the possibilities of conventional flair imaging.
