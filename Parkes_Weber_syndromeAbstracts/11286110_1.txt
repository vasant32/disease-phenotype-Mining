AIM OF THE PAPER: To evaluate the effectiveness of transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation in treatment of secondary glaucoma in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 children (50 eyes) with secondary glaucoma (aphakic, posttraumatic, in Sturge-Weber syndrome and in aniridia) which was uncontrolled with medical and surgical therapy or the surgery had a high risk of postoperative complications. In all patients diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation has been performed. RESULTS: After one month intraocular pressure was reduced (with or without medical treatment) below 23 mm Hg in 40% of patients and after 6 months in 68% of patients. The worst results were observed in posttraumatic glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a safe and effective method of secondary glaucoma therapy in children uncontrolled with other methods of medical and surgical therapy or when the surgery has a high risk of postoperative complications.
