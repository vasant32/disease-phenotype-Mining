Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a disorder involving central nervous system abnormalities that may increase the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Records of 19 patients with suspected growth hormone deficiency (GHD), identified from a registry of 1653 patients with SWS, were reviewed; nine patients with GHD were found.
