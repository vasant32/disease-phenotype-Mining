The authors observed a 20-year-old female patient who had come to Department of Dentistry, Kyungpook National University Hospital due to the chief complaints of gingival enlargement and pain on the upper jaw. We performed the clinical, hematologic and radiologic examinations for the patient and obtained the following results; 1. We observed a nevus flammeus on the right side of the facial area, soft palate and buccal mucosa. 2. The enlargement of the upper and lower gingiva, we thought, was due to inflammatory reaction. 3. The above clinical signs were found in accordance with the maxillary and ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve. 4. The maxillary sinus was enlarged in Water's view. 5. Finally, we have reached the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome for the patient.
