 CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 34-year-old man with Sturge-Weber syndrome, who presented to the emergency room with left ocular pain and left chronic exophthalmos. He suffered an acute glaucoma secondary to pupillary block consequent upon an anterior lens subluxation. Orbital contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed and he underwent intracapsular lens extraction. DISCUSSION: The MRI showed T2 enhanced lesions in the left meninges, choroid, and orbit, compatible with cavernous hemangiomas, as well as a dilated superior ophthalmic vein. Intraocular pressure after cataract surgery was 10 mm Hg, and visual acuity was less than 20/200.
