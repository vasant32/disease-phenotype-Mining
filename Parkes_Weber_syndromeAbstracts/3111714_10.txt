Computed tomography scanning in two young patients with recurrent, pulsating, migraine-like headache showed parieto-occipital calcifications. One patient presented with an atypical form of the Sturge-Weber syndrome, and the other with celiac disease and folic acid deficiency. The clinical features were analyzed and compared with those in other cases reported in the recent literature which have shown bioccipital calcifications but no cutaneous angiomas, sometimes associated with visual and/or intelligence deficit and epilepsy. Finally, the possible connection between cerebral calcifications and headache is discussed.
