Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare, sporadic, congenital neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by facial cutaneous vascular malformation, leptomeningeal angioma and eye abnormalities. Seizures develop during the first year of life, may become refractory to multiple anticonvulsants and status epilepticus may develop. A rare subtype of Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral facial vascular malformation, unilateral cerebral involvement and neonatal status epilepticus is reported here. Neonatal status epilepticus was successfully controlled with intravenous levetiracetam infusion.
