Pathological intracranial calcifications detected on computed tomography of 83 children during a six-year period were reviewed. The common causes in our series were tuberous sclerosis and intracranial tumors. Other conditions associated with calcification were Sturge-Weber syndrome, neurofibromatosis, Cockayne's syndrome, hypoparathyroidism, arteriovenous malformations, vein of Galen aneurysm, encephalomalacia, cerebral infarcts, subdural hematoma, cerebral infections, birth asphyxia and dihydropteridine reductase deficiency. In two cases (2%), calcifications were idiopathic. The distribution and location of the calcifications in these conditions are discussed.
