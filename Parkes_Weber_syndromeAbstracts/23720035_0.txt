Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) consists of a capillary-venous vascular malformation of the brain, skin and eye. Urine vascular biomarkers have been demonstrated to be abnormal in other vascular anomalies and to correlate with clinical severity and progression. The current study investigated the use of urinary matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels to non-invasively monitor the progression of SWS. Fifty-four urine samples were collected from patients seen at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute. Urine was analyzed for MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF levels and correlated with clinical outcome at the time of urine collection (n = 48) and 1 year following urine collection (n = 22). Analysis revealed that MMP-2 (p = 0.033) and MMP-9 (p = 0.010) were significantly more likely to be present in the urine of SWS subjects compared to controls and that bFGF was significantly more likely to be present at abnormal levels (p = 0.005). MMP-2 correlated with a more severe clinical score at the time of urine collection, while both MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels correlated with greater disease severity at time of collection. bFGF levels correlated with improved clinical score 1 year after urine collection. These results suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels may be useful in assessing SWS progression, as well as indicating which patients might benefit from more aggressive treatment, while bFGF levels may be useful in judging the efficacy of neurologic treatment in SWS.
