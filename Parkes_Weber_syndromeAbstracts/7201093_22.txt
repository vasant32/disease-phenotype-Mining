Eight patients were studied 3 to 16 years (mean, 10 years) after cerebral hemispherectomy. Seven have infantile hemiplegia, and one had Sturge-Weber disease. Preoperative assessment included EEG responses to intracarotid drug injections. Postoperative complications occurred in seven patients. The operation was followed by a marked reduction in seizure frequency and improvement in behavior, with little change in intellect or hemiplegia. Neuropsychological assessment performed in four patients showed that they were not aphasic, but nonverbal spatial abilities were poor. CT showed marked shift of the remaining hemisphere in five of six patients scanned.
