A case of meningioma without dural attachment within the fourth ventricle associated with Sturge-Weber disease is reported. Review of the literature revealed that meningiomas arising from the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle and lying totally within the fourth ventricle are very rare. Coexistence of Sturge-Weber disease with meningioma of the fourth ventricle has never been reported, as far as we could find out.
