The authors describe a case of epileptic monocular nystagmus in a cognitively intact adult with normal vision. Focal seizures originated in the occipital lobe contralateral to the involved eye, and an associated structural lesion was thought to represent a forme fruste of Sturge-Weber syndrome. It is hypothesized that the seizure discharge either activated a cortical saccade region and caused simultaneous supranuclear inhibition of ipsilateral eye movement or triggered monocular eye movement commands.
