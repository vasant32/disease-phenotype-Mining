In a series of eight patients with the Sturge-Weber syndrome, the brain scan was shown to be the most accurate, non-invasive, diagnostic test, being abnormal in all eight patients. In four cases examined by cerebral arteriography, this study was also conspicuously abnormal. Some of the neurological disturbances occurring in these patients are more likely to be due to transient ischaemic attacks and cerebral infarctions than to epilepsy.
