 PURPOSE: Report the resolution of a persistent exudative retinal detachment in a patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome following intravitreal pegaptanib injection. DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A 13-year-old male with Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with a choroidal hemangioma associated with an exudative retinal detachment that failed to resolve 6 months after external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: A single intravitreal pegaptanib injection resulted in 50% resolution of the detachment within 1 week and complete resolution within a month. Despite anatomic success, vision remained poor. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of Sturge-Weber choroidal hemangioma-associated exudative retinal detachment and offers potential treatment.
