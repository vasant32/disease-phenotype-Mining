The authors report the case of a woman with Sturge-Weber syndrome (oculotrigeminate form) presenting with neovascular glaucoma of abrupt onset during pregnancy. Since medical treatment failed, she underwent a retrobulbar alcoholisation. Three months after delivery, enucleation was performed for esthetic reasons. The enucleated eye showed diffuse choroidal angioma, total retinal detachment and a prepapillary glial proliferation. We discuss this uncommon association.
