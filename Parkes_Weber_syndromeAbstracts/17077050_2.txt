Quantitative brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to characterize one patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Choline increases and N-acetylaspartate decreases were observed in pathologic frontal gray matter tissue compared to contralateral unaffected brain tissue without any change in the diffusion tensor imaging parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient). The N-acetylaspartate decreases and/or choline increases observed here and in eight previously described Sturge-Weber patients probably reflect neuronal loss or dysfunction and demyelination as a result of recurrent seizures.
