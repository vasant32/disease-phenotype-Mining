A moderately retarded institutionalized patient diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome and bilateral retinitis pigmentosa underwent enucleation OD because of intractable pain secondary to glaucoma in 1965. Twenty-three years later, the patient had a dislocated lens OS. Although the lens dislocation might have been caused by trauma, it also might be associated with either Sturge-Weber syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa. The role of protective eye wear in one-eyed institutionalized retarded patients is discussed. To our knowledge, this combination of Sturge-Weber syndrome, bilateral retinitis pigmentosa, and a dislocated lens has not been reported previously.
