We studied a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome in a 66-year-old woman, who displayed associated angiomas of the thyroid gland and choroid plexi and leptomeningeal melanosis. These findings are discussed in light of the proposed pathogenesis of the syndrome and its relationship to the other neuroectodermal dysplasias.
