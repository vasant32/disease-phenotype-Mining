A case of intracranial extraosseous 99mTc MDP uptake is presented, which was found on CT to be due to dystrophic gyral calcification characteristic of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). The imaging characteristics of SWS are described. The possibility of extraosseous MDP uptake should be considered when unusual or atypical 'hot spots' are seen on bone scanning.
