A case of Sturge-Weber syndrome is described in which all paranasal sinuses were grossly enlarged. The mastoid, petrous and squamous portions of the temporal bone on both sides were fully pneumatized and the right orbit was distorted. There was resistant infection in the left maxillary sinus. These unusual features were well demonstrated by computed tomographic scans.
