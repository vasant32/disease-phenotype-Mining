Two patients with adolescent onset glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber Syndrome have been presented. Both patients were successfully treated with ab externo trabeculectomy. This procedure is suggested as an additional means for controlling the late onset glaucoma associated with the syndrome without provoking additional complications or deterioration. Early treatment is emphasized before the irreversible changes of chronic glaucoma become manifest.
