Migraine is common in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, yet treatment options are poorly described. An Internet-based questionnaire was completed anonymously by 104 Sturge-Weber syndrome patients, 74 of whom reported experiencing migraines (median age, 25 years; range, 3-64 years). Sixteen (22%) subjects self-reported trying triptans. Five of 12 (42%) describing triptan response believed they were very efficacious (median time of onset of 26 minutes), compared to 13 of 65 (20%) using over-the-counter analgesics (P = .08). Eighty-eight percent (14/16) of triptan users self-reported that when they do not use medications, migraines had a moderate to severe impact on their quality of life; however, while taking triptans, only 50% (7/14) of users reported such an impact (P = .03). Two patients using triptans reported transient unilateral weakness. Of the 26 patients (35%) who received daily preventative medications, 80% experienced improved quality of life. In addition, only 10 of 24 (42%) reported a significant negative impact of migraines on quality of life with daily preventative use, compared to 22 of 26 (85%) without their use (P = .002). Sturge-Weber syndrome patients with migraines are using triptans and preventative agents and self-reporting good efficacy. The small sample size precludes any safety analysis, however, and future prospective trials of both treatment options are needed.
