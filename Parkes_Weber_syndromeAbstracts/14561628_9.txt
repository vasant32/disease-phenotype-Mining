We report the case of a 9-month-old boy with Sturge-Weber syndrome and new onset of seizure. Perfusion MR imaging showed early changes compatible with impaired venous drainage in the affected hemisphere, whereas proton MR spectroscopic imaging revealed a focal parietal area of elevated choline without significant alteration of N-acetylaspartate levels. The perfusion and subtle metabolic abnormalities are comparable with the extent of the overlying leptomeningeal enhancement, illustrating the early pathophysiological manifestation of this disease.
