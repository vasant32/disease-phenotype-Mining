Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder that typically presents with angiomas involving the face, ocular choroid and ipsilateral supratentorial leptomeninges. Posterior fossa involvement is extremely rare. We present two patients with simultaneous supra- and infratentorial involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtracted angiography (DSA) findings are discussed.
