Sturge Weber syndrome is characterized by unilateral facial nevus with a tram track appearance on CT scan. However different variants have been described. We report one such variant in a 14 months old child with bilateral facial nevus and bilateral curvilinear calcification. There was also global development delay and early onset of seizures reflecting the severe bilateral cortical changes.
