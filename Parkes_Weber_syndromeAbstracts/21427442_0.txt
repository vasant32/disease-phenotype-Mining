Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital disorder. Seizures, stroke-like episodes, glaucoma, headache, and developmental delay are frequently associated features. An Internet-based questionnaire was designed to assess the frequency of use, effectiveness, and safety of aspirin treatment in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Thirty-four of 98 subjects who completed the survey reported having used aspirin. The mean number of reported stroke-like episodes was reduced from 1.1 to 0.3 per month in the year after starting aspirin (n = 26, p = .014). The median number of seizures was significantly reduced from 3 to 1 episodes per month (n = 21, p = .002). Thirty-nine percent of subjects reported a history of complications (predominantly increased bruising or gum/nose bleeding) while on aspirin; however, none reported discontinuing aspirin because of side effects. Our study showed a significant relative reduction in both self-reported seizure frequency and stroke-like episodes after starting aspirin. It also suggests that low-dose aspirin can be safely used in these patients.
