Classic Sturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by a facial nevus and hamartomatous lesion in the brain. Hamartomatous lesions are usually located in the ipsilateral occipital region of the facial nevus. The other lobes may be involved. A few cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome without facial nevus have been reported. A 9-month-old male was admitted with the complaint of afebrile seizures two times. We observed the third seizure, which was complex partial, in the clinic. There was no facial hemangioma. On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain we observed findings concordant with the angioma in the right frontoparietal region, although the occipital region was intact. This patient appears to be the first with Sturge-Weber syndrome without facial nevus, and with involvement of the frontoparietal region but not the occipital region. We do not know the embryologic basis of this association.
