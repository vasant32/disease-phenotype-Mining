A rare form of angiomatous dysplasia with hypotrophy of the left arm is described. Numerous haemodynamically significant arterio-venous fistulae could be demonstrated in the soft tissues and in bone. The venous and lymphatic systems were normal. The lacunar reticular-cystic changes in the spongiosa of the phalanges are pathognomonic of arterial angiodysplasia of the Weber type. In most cases this is associated with bone hypertrophy.
