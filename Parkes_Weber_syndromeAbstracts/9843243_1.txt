We report the case of an infant with Sturge-Weber syndrome whose regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) showed an increase and a subsequent decrease. As compared with simultaneous CT and MR findings, we speculate that the transient increase in rCBF reflects the neuronal reaction to hypoxia caused by congestion.
