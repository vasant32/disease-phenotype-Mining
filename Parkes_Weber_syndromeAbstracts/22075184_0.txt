 OBJECTIVE: We combined perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) with 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to study the relationship between regional metabolic and perfusion abnormalities and their clinical correlates in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). METHODS: Fifteen children (age: 0.9-10 years) with unilateral SWS underwent high-resolution PWI and FDG PET prospectively. Regional (lobar) asymmetry indices (AIs) of subcortical white matter (WM) cerebral blood flow (CBF) were correlated with corresponding cortical FDG uptake asymmetries, extent of leptomeningeal vascular malformation and clinical seizure variables. RESULTS: Abnormal cortical glucose metabolism and/or subcortical WM CBF were seen in all lobes affected by vascular malformation and extended to lobes not affected by abnormal pial vessels in 6 patients. Lower CBF was associated with lower cortical glucose metabolism in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes (p≤0.02). While decreased perfusion was associated with hypometabolism in most cases, increased regional CBF (found in 6 patients) was commonly associated with relatively mild or no hypometabolism. Ten of 24 cerebral lobes with normal glucose metabolism in the affected hemisphere showed abnormal perfusion. High seizure frequency was associated with severe parieto-occipital hypoperfusion (p≤0.03), while long duration of epilepsy was related to frontal lobe hypometabolism (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Regional perfusion and cortical metabolic abnormalities can extend beyond lobes affected by leptomeningeal vascular malformations and are related to epilepsy in SWS. Despite a general correlation between perfusion and metabolism, increased WM perfusion with preserved cortical metabolism in overlying cortex is a common pattern of a perfusion/metabolic mismatch. This may represent a disease stage where cortical function is preserved while increased WM perfusion provides collateral drainage of cortex via the deep vein system.
