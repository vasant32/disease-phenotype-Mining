We examined the eyes of 50 patients with nevus flammeus of the face (port wine stain). Of 26 patients with nevus flammeus involving the area of both the first and second sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve, 4 had glaucoma and 8 were glaucoma suspects. Because the age at which glaucoma develops is uncertain, these patients require periodic ocular assessment. When the nevus flammeus involved the area of V1 alone or V2 alone, there was no associated glaucoma.
