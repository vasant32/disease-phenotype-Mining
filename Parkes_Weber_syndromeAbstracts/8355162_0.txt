A 6-year-old patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome and secondary glaucoma had trabeculectomy and subsequent reconstruction of a shallow anterior chamber. Six months later, a dense fibrin clot and anterior capsule cataract developed, requiring surgery. Using the anterior chamber maintainer technique, extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed. Twelve months later visual acuity was 20/30, intraocular pressure was 14 mg Hg, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet.
