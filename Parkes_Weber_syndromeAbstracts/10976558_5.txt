PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of augmented trabeculectomy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (MMC) compared to 5-FU only for the treatment of pediatric glaucoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 8 children (12 eyes) with pediatric glaucoma, either congenital or secondary to: lens aspiration, Sturge-Weber syndrome, or steroids underwent augmented trabeculectomy. Six patients (8 eyes) underwent augmented trabeculectomy with 5-FU plus MMC and 2 patients (4 eyes) underwent augmented trabeculectomy with 5-FU only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between-group comparison of postoperative parameters: change in intraocular pressure (IOP), dependence on antiglaucoma medication, number of 5-FU injections, cup-disc ratio, corneal diameter, drug-induced complications. RESULTS: In the 5-FU/MMC group, 7/8 eyes showed good control of postoperative IOP (9-16 mm Hg), which was independent of antiglaucoma therapy; only 2 injections of 5-FU were needed. By contrast, in the 5-FU group, no control of the postoperative IOP (21-23 mm Hg) was achieved in 4/4 eyes, and these patients remained dependent on antiglaucoma medication; up to 6 injections of 5-FU were used. There was no deterioration in the cup-disc ratio or the corneal diameter in either group. Results were maintained on follow-up (23-27 months). No significant drug-induced complications were noted. CONCLUSION: Augmented trabeculectomy with adjunctive 5-FU/MMC may be an option for the control of pediatric glaucoma in patients with a poor surgical prognosis.
