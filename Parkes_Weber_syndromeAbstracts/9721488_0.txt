The application of radiosurgical treatment in ophthalmology is a new and not quite common procedure. The existence of 80 departments in the world with more than 15,000 treated patients suggests however that the therapeutic method is being extended and that its application in ophthalmology will be more extensive in future. The most numerous indication groups for treatment with a Leksell gamma-knife(LGK) worldwide are vascular malformations (44%), benign tumours (33%) and malignant tumours (22%). Other groups include among others functional disorders and metastatic processes (15).
