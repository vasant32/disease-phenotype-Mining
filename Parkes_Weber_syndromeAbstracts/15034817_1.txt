Port wine stains (PWSs) represent the most common type of vascular malformation. With the advent of pulsed-dye laser therapy, treatment of these lesions has become achievable with minimal prospect of adverse scarring. Although many scientific articles have heralded the favorable outcomes in patients who have undergone pulsed-dye laser treatments, few articles address the practical considerations (pre-, intra-, and postoperative) that must be followed to ensure success. This article presents the 10-year experience of the senior author (EFW) in the management of port wine malformations and the clinical insights that have been gleaned from that extensive experience. Introductory remarks are made as to the nature of PWSs, related syndromes, and the evolution of treatment; practical management guidelines are then discussed.
