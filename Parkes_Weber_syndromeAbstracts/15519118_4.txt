We describe a 7-month-old female with leptomeningeal angiomatosis who developed infantile spasms. She did not manifest facial nevus or ocular choroidal angioma. Leptomeningeal angiomatosis is characterized by venous angiomas of leptomeninges and usually accompanied by facial nevus, a condition known as Sturge-Weber syndrome. In Sturge-Weber syndrome, leptomeningeal angiomas can cause infantile spasms but much less frequently than in other neurocutaneous syndromes, such as tuberous sclerosis. This patient is the first reported case of leptomeningeal angiomatosis without facial nevus who developed infantile spasms. Leptomeningeal angiomas should be taken into consideration as a cause of infantile spasms, even in the absence of facial nevus. We suggest that this case is clinically within the spectrum of Sturge-Weber syndrome, and that the embryologic origin of this case is similar to that of Sturge-Weber syndrome.
