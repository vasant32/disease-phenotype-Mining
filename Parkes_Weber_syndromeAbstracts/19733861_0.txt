Hemiplegic migraine (HM) in the setting of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) has been previously described. Here, we report clinical and multimodal imaging data on a 21-year-old man with SWS and HM, who presented during an acute HM attack with a dense left-hemispheric syndrome (expressive aphasia and right sensorimotor hemiplegia), lasting for more than 10 days. Repeated EEGs were without evidence of status epilepticus. Consistent with previous findings in prolonged migraine aura, perfusion computed tomography demonstrated left-hemispheric hyperperfusion on day 7. 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (day 7) revealed left-hemispheric hypermetabolism. After 14 days, the patient was symptom-free and discharged home. Follow-up after 30 days showed normal neurological status. Our observation confirms and reinforces the comorbidity of SWS and HM and shows that prolonged HM attacks are associated with complex changes of both cerebral perfusion and glucose metabolism. A pathophysiological model explaining both the association between SWS/HM and the observed imaging changes is presented.
