Four patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome were evaluated with CT and MR. MR demonstrated the characteristic features of the disease: cerebral atrophy (four patients), ipsilateral bone and sinus hypertrophy (three), ocular findings (one), intracranial calcification (four), prominent deep venous system (three), and enlarged choroid plexus (two). CT demonstrated the following: cerebral atrophy (four), ipsilateral bone and sinus hypertrophy (three), calcification (four), gyral enhancement (two), prominent deep venous system (two), and enlarged choroid plexuses (three). The features of Sturge-Weber syndrome were visualized equally well with MR and CT with the exception of intracranial calcification. Conventional spin-echo MR revealed fewer calcifications, and those visualized appeared smaller than with CT. Gradient-echo acquisition sequences were more effective in the detection of intracranial calcification.
