A 3-year-old boy was reported, who suffered from attacks of hemiconvulsion and hemiparesis. Carotid angiography showed anomalous cerebral venous drainage with a decrease in the number of superficial cortical veins, and dilatation of medullary veins and deep veins. Brain scanning demonstrated abnormality of regional cerebral blood flow and delay of both uptake and drainage of radionuclide. These are similar to the findings known in Sturge-Weber disease, so that a leptomeningeal angiomatosis was strongly suggested. Flunarizine which has a cerebral vasodilating effect improved his clinical symptoms significantly, and his attack disappeared completely.
