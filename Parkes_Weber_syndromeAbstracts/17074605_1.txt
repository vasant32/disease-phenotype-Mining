Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome with a facial port-wine nevus and neurologic features, typically including seizures and hemiparesis. Glaucoma may also occur. MRI features include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, cortical and pial calcifications, and angiomatous change of the choroid plexus. We reviewed a subset of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome with the rare finding of deep venous occlusion, and present such a case, unusual by comparison to previously reported cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome with deep venous occlusion. Six previously reported cases were reviewed. All cases presented with seizures; five of six had evidence of leptomeningeal angiomatosis; half had cerebral hemiatrophy. This report presents a unique case lacking clinical seizures, but with a port-wine stain and congenital glaucoma. This patient lacked the radiologic findings of leptomeningeal angiomatosis and hemicerebral atrophy, but demonstrated deep venous occlusion with frontal venous collaterals. There is a wide spectrum of findings in Sturge-Weber syndrome. The lack of seizures and angiomatosis in this case are likely "true-true" and related. The case illustrates the unusual finding of deep venous occlusion in Sturge-Weber syndrome occurring without leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Additionally, it demonstrates that although the initial evaluation is normal, patients may later manifest clinical characteristics of Sturge-Weber syndrome.
