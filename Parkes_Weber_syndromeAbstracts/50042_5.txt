The presence of a structurally abnormal extra chromosome in a patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome and several members of her family is described. With routine techniques the abnormal chromosome is slightly submetacentric, of the size of a G group chromosome and shows satellites on both arms. C-banding suggested the presence of 2 centromeric regions rather than one, and to explain this finding, in addition to the segregation of the abnormal chromosome through 3 generations and why only one centromere is visible with the usual cytogenetic technique, an hypothesis is advanced suggesting that it resulted from an unusual type of Robertsonian translocation, in which one of the breacks involved directly the centromere of an acrocentric producing a partially dicentric bisate-lited chromosome. The association of Sturge-Weber syndrome with the chromosome abnormality is thought to be fortuitous and the lack of clinical manifestations of all members of this family with the abnormal chromosome, including one with two extra ones, is explained by the fact that it was almost entirely formed by heterochromatic material. The usefulness of C-banding in the study of this patient is strongly emphasized.
