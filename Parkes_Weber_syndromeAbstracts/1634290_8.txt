The authors describe ten cases of cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC). All of these cases were sporadic. The incidence of associated anomalies was relatively low, and three patients had skin manifestations (cutaneous atrophy and nevus telangiectaticus). In two patients, the right leg was shorter and thinner. Another two showed neurologic symptoms without lasting neurologic damage. New associated anomalies, such as tendinitis stenosans and bowing of the lower legs, did not provide additional information regarding the cause of CMTC. The authors suggest that Happle's lethal gene hypothesis for Klippel-Trenaunay and Sturge-Weber syndromes also could be applied to CMTC.
