An infant with the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome also had new findings of porencephaly and nonfunctioning major cerebral venous sinuses. This infant is the first described with the syndrome to undergo angiographic study. Similar nonfunctioning major cerebral venous sinuses are seen in the Sturge-Weber syndrome. A leptomeningeal angioma recently was reported in a newborn with the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome. The central nervous system disturbances in this syndrome might be secondary to developmental vascular anomalies. Therefore, the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome exhibits important similarities to the Sturge-Weber variety of neurocutaneous syndrome.
