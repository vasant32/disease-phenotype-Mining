The authors describe a case of expulsive choroidal effusion which occurred in the course of a fistulating operation in a child with Sturge-Weber syndrome. This is the youngest patient with this complication so far reported in the literature. The persistent postoperative choroidal and retinal detachments in this case led to a considerable diminution of visual acuity.
