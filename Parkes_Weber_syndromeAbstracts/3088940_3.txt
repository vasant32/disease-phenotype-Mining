Eight patients with Sturge-Weber disease were evaluated by CT (six patients), MR (one patient), or both (one patient). CT scans of five of seven patients showed enlargement and increased enhancement of the choroid plexus on the same side as the facial and intracranial lesions. MRI showed similar findings in both patients examined. This enlargement, seen in six of eight cases of Sturge-Weber disease, is compatible with the presence of angiomatous malformations of the choroid plexus. It appears to be a common finding in this disease.
