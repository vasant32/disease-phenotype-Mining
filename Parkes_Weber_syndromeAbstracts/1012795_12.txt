Cerebral cortical calcification identical to that of the Sturge-Weber syndrome was observed in two children. In one child the calcification appeared after intrathecal administration of methotrexate and skull irradiation because of leukemia involving the central nervous system. In the other child, who had coeliac disease and epilepsy, the calcification appeared after treatment with anticonvulsants. This treatment was also contributing to the development of profound megaloblastic anemia. The unspecificity of the Sturge-Weber calcification is stressed and the hypothesis is put forward that the calcification may be secondary to folic acid deficiency interfering with the matabolism in the central nervous system.
