A total of 27 cases of choroidal hemangioma was evaluated with radioactive phosphorus uptake studies. In each case the diagnosis of malignant melanoma was initially entertained, but the 32P test was unequivocally negative in every instance. Follow-up studies in every case have supported the clinical diagnosis. In 22 patients, the lesion was treated with photocoagulation, and in every treated case the serous macular detachment disappeared. The importance of early and correct clinical diagnosis is stressed, since these are salvageable and potentially useful seeing eyes.
