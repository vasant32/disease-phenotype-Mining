A case of classical Sturge-Weber syndrome associated with infantile spasms (female infant, aged 4 months) was presented. The association of both conditions would be very rare since no similar case was found among 214 cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome and 1,180 cases of infantile spasms gathered from the literature, except for one who was reported by Millichap et al. Evolutional changes of electroencephalographic findings were followed up for about 3 years on average in 5 personal cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Unilateral depression of electrical activity in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the facial nevi was the constant finding. Focal spike discharges were noticed only in the contralateral hemisphere in 3 cases, only in the ipsilateral in 1, and in the bilateral in 1.
