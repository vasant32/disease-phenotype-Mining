It is characterized by congenital hamartomatous malformations involving the eye, skin, and central nervous system. Several ocular complications are associated with SWS, including glaucoma. CASE: A 66-year-old black man presented with a history of SWS and previously diagnosed glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be aware of cutaneous, neurologic, and ocular complications of this condition. However, glaucoma is the most common ocular complication of SWS.
