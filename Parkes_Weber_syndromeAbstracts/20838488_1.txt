This case report shows a genealogical study where a woman has limb hypertrophy and her son has an association of Sturge-Weber syndrome with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The Sturge-Weber and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndromes appear to be different manifestations of the same affliction. Familial aggregation exists and transmission may be almost imperceptible between generations. Identification of minor manifestations may prove to be a valuable contribution to genetic counseling of families and the prevention of new cases.
