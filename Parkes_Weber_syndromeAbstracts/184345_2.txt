Up until now 39 cases of combined Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome have been described. Here follows the report of a girl, now 4 years of age, displaying a full combination of these syndromes. Only a small part of the body surface is not covered with naevi teleangiectatici laterales. The patient has clear hypertrophy of the left cheek and of the left lower extremity, less noticeable on the left upper extremity. For therapeutic reasons the left side of the head and the left lower extremity were thoroughly angiographically examined--this revealed typical abnormalities. The vessel-alteration of the lower extremity are not extremely far developed and arteriovenous fistulas on a large scale are also absent. This allows us to dismiss the F.P. Weber syndrome on the one hand, while it explains the absence of complications of the Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, as described in literature, on the other. The significance of the alterations of lymph nodes in this disease, which we are the first to describe, is at present not fully clear. The cerebral attacks have until now showed only a temporary response to medication.
