A 16-year-old boy with a diagnosis of Parkes-Weber syndrome presented with a lower leg discrepancy of 3 cm for orthopaedic management. He had the triad of red skin lesion, lymphoedema and overgrowth of the right leg and multiple arteriovenous fistulae confirmed by angiography. Considering the risk of aggravating the vascular lesion, we decided conservative management of unequal limb lengths as long as this is well tolerated.
