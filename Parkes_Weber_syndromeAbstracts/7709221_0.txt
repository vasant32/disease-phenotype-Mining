The authors report on a case where the Klippel-Trenaunay symptom complex was combined with a Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome, which, however, was only noticeable during pregnancy by fetal macrosomy and hydramnios. The child was delivered on term by Caesarean section and presented no paediatric problems; however, during the first few years of its life mental retardation became clearly evident.
