The authors examined the clinicopathologic features of a 4-year-old boy with a diffuse choroidal hemangioma, yet without any features of the Sturge-Weber syndrome. The tumor occurred as a grayish intraocular mass with an overlying retinal detachment and was highly reflective in the ultrasonic examination. After contrast, the CT scan revealed diffuse thickening of the ocular wall associated with an enhanced irregular orbital mass. The pathologic examination revealed a cavernous hemangioma involving the entire choroid with extrascleral extension. Diffuse choroidal hemangioma occurring in childhood and unrelated to the Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare condition that should be included in the differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma.
