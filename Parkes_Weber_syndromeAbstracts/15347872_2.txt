This study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric epilepsy clinic to ascertain the spectrum of development malformations in children, with seizures. Seventy Six Children (0-12 yr) with seizures and CNS malformations based on neuroimaging were included. Observed anomalies included dysgenetic corpus callosum (DCC), lissencephaly, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), pachygyria, polymicrogyria, heterotopia, schizencephaly, holoprosencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and phakomatoses like tuberous sclerosis, Sturge Weber syndrome and linear cutaneous nevus syndrome. Seizure semiology varied in all categories. Microcephaly, developmental delay and tone abnormalities were common clinical findings. 60.5 percent cases presented in infancy. The characteristic EEG features provided a clue to the diagnosis of anomalies like lissencephaly, agenesis of corpus callosum and alobar holoprosencephaly.
