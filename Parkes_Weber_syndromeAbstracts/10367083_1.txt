Haemangiomas are different from true superficial vascular malformations. The haemangiomas, mainly affecting the newborn and small babies, will, after a phase of progression, sometimes regress completely. Therapeutic abstention is the rule except in high risk angiomas when steroid therapy may be effective. Visceral involvement poses problems. Superficial vascular malformations, on the other hand, arise at all ages and may affect any blood vessel. Each type has a specific clinical presentation, complementary investigations and appropriate treatment. Some are slowly progressive, for example capillary, venous and lymphatic malformations. Others are haemodynamically active, such as the arteriovenous malformations. Capillary malformations are flat angiomas with aesthetic consequences, apart from the Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome. Cold, blue venous malformations confirmed by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, when necessary, require treatment adapted to their site and size: compression, embolisation, surgery or abstention. Lymphatic malformations may be cystic or tissular: the cystic lymphangioma, a soft swelling of often healthy skin, with compartments separated by septa on ultrasound scan, is usually treated by ethibloc embolisation. Arteriovenous malformations, warm and pulsatile, demonstrated at arteriography, may progress rapidly and treatment by surgery or embolisation, when necessary, has to be complete. Finally, there are complex vascular malformations which pose very difficult problems of management.
