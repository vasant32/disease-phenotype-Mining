Young infants may present to an emergency department after an acute life-threatening event. The differential diagnosis for an acute life-threatening event is quite extensive. Fortunately, most will have benign or treatable causes. A case of Sturge-Weber syndrome is described in a 2-day old who presented to the emergency department after an acute life-threatening event. A thorough history and detailed physical examination are generally helpful in discerning the etiology for most acute life-threatening events and may at times reveal unusual diseases such as Sturge-Weber syndrome.
