 PURPOSE: To report the effect of a single intravitreal bevacizumab injection on serous retinal detachment (SRD) in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 15-year-old boy with history of SWS was referred with a complaint of sudden visual loss 2 days before, having choroidal hemangioma accompanied with SRD. Visual acuity was 20/160. RESULTS: He was treated with 1.25 mg of bevacizumab injected intravitreally. One week later, the retina was completely attached and visual acuity was 20/20. After 20 months, without repeating the injection, the retina remained attached and vision was stable. CONCLUSIONS: An early single dose of intravitreal bevacizumab is effective in the treatment of serous retinal detachment in SWS with good long-term results.
