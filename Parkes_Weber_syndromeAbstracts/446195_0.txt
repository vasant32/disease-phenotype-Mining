Findings in computed tomography (CT) with or without contrast infusion were analyzed in 8 patients with Sturge-Weber disease. From the extent of calcification in the CT, Sturge-Weber disease can be classified into two types, localized and diffuse. The extent of calcification or cortical atrophy is predictable, if it can be shown that enhanced areas in contrast infusion CT truly represent leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Thus, using enhanced CT, the capacity of prediciton as to whether the patient will have a localized or diffuse type of disease will be possible with further observations.
