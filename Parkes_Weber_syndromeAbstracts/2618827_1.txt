A case of a 13-year-old girl with bilateral cortical calcifications of the Sturge-Weber type at CT examination, without cutaneous lesions and ocular abnormalities is described. She had seizures appearing within the first year of life which never recurred since the age of two years. At the age of ten years she began to suffer from occasional migraine attacks. Her neurological examination and psychological testing did not show any significant abnormality. This case can be regarded as an unusual atypical form of Sturge-Weber syndrome, unless the existence of a new disorder is assumed.
