Three patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (5 months, 6 years, and 17 years old) were studied prospectively with MR imaging and CT of the brain. Both techniques demonstrated parenchymal volume loss, choroid plexus enlargement, calvarial hemiatrophy, and proptosis. In regions of parenchymal volume loss, MR alone demonstrated thickened cortex with decreased convolutions and abnormal white matter. A focal thalamic lesion and prominent medullary and subependymal veins were also shown better by MR. However, CT definitively demonstrated the characteristic cortical calcification, while T2-weighted MR images detected only smaller, nonspecific foci of hypointense signal. MR and CT are complementary in the evaluation of Sturge-Weber syndrome.
