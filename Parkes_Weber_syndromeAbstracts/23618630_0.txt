Sturge-Weber syndrome is a nonhereditary congenital neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by leptomeningeal angiomatosis, facial nevus flammeus, and diffuse choroidal hemangioma, which when complicated by total retinal detachment, portend a poor prognosis. Management is often limited to salvage external beam irradiation. We present a modified proton therapy technique for young children with total bullous retinal detachments that uses standard fractionation low-dose proton radiotherapy to decrease the risk of radiation complications. Treatment techniques for young children who cannot cooperate with conventional radiation protocols are also described.
