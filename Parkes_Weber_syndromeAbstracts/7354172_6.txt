Computed tomographic findings in two infants with Sturge-Weber syndrome include calcification of the brain not visible on plain radiographs. In both cases, the choroid plexus was very prominent, and, in one, a hemangioma of the choroid plexus was found at surgery. In the other, especially dense deposits of mineral were identified at surgery to be calcified branches of the middle cerebral artery.
