A case of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) with gastrointestinal hemorrhage is presented. SWS is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by cutaneous facial angioma leptomeningeal angioma with seizures and other neurologic complications. Associated anomalies beyond the encephalofacial territory are very rare. The patient presented repeated bleeds from extensive gastric varices of the fundus secondary to a splenic venous malformation. This is the first report on this association to our knowledge.
