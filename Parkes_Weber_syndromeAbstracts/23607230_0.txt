 BACKGROUNDS AND PURPOSE: To correlate the extent of the leptomeningeal angiomatosis with clinical features in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). METHODS: The study group consisted of 86 consecutive patients aged two months to 56 (mean 7.9 +/- 10.3) years with SWS and epilepsy. Clinical and MRI data were analyzed. RESULTS: Based on the extent of leptomeningeal angiomatosis, patients were divided into two subgroups: 43 patients had hemispheric angiomatosis and atrophy, whereas, another 43 had focal involvement. Nine of the 43 hemispherial patients (10%) showed bilateral involvement: all of these bilateral cases demonstrated dominance in a single side with hemispheric leptomeningeal angiomatosis and contralateral focal extension. Hemispheric and focal subgroups were clinically different. Patients with hemispheric SWS were younger at the age of epilepsy onset (p < 0.001) and age at MRI examination (p < 0.05). Neither gender, lateralization, duration of epilepsy, appearance of secondarily generalized seizures, nor seizure frequency revealed a significant difference between subgroups. CONCLUSION: Bilateral involvement is frequent and occurs in cases with a hemisperic involvement on one side. The age of epilepsy onset is related to the extent of leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Patients with hemispheric form of SWS presented with earlier age of seizure onset. Focal pial angiomatoses do not tend to progress (a longer duration is not associated with more frequent hemispheric involvement). Other variables including seizure frequency and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures are not associated with the extent of angiomatosis.
