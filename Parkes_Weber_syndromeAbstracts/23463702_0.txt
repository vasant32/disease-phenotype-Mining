PURPOSE: To explore whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can localize specific segments of primary motor areas in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), this study investigated the corticospinal tract (CST) between precentral gyrus (PCG) and posterior limb of internal capsule (PIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DWI was performed on 32 healthy children and seven children with unilateral SWS affecting the sensorimotor area variably. A hierarchical dendrogram was applied to find PCG-segments uniquely connected to PIC-segments. The resulting PCG-clusters were used to image primary motor pathways in DWI and find metabolic abnormalities of primary motor areas in positron emission tomography (PET) scans. RESULTS: In healthy children, five PCG-clusters were found to have unique CST courses, corresponding to CST segments of mouth/lip, fingers, and leg/ankle primary motor areas determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In children with SWS, reduced streamlines in these PCG clusters were highly correlated with glucose-hypometabolism on PET (R(2) = 0.2312, P = 0.0032). Impaired CST segment corresponding to finger movements correlated with severity of hand motor deficit. CONCLUSION: The presented method can detect impaired CST segments corresponding to specific motor functions in young children who cannot cooperate for fMRI. This approach can be clinically useful for a noninvasive presurgical evaluation of cortical motor areas in such children. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013;. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
