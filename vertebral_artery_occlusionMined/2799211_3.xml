<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case of crescendo vertebro-basilar attacks is reported and related to an ulcerated plaque of the vertebral artery ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent surgical endarterectomy after failure of an antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He has remained asymptomatic for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of vertebral artery ulceration is difficult by ultrasonics or digitalized arteriography because of the small diameter of the vessel and its posterior origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ulcerated plaques of the subclavio-vertebral intersection is probably underestimated in the literature Labauge et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(1987) emphasized recently the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> during the natural history of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crescendo vertebro-basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> can be caused by a plaque rupture of of the vertebral ostium which leads secondarily to vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic options for atheromatous lesions of the posterior circulation are not clearly defined by controlled studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the reported case and in series reported in the literature, surgery would appear to be an efficient procedure with low mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
