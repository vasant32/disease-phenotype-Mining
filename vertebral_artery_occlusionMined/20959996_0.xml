<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by impingement of osseous and/or ligamentous structures on the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We review the differential diagnosis and recommended workup for posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anatomical cause for pediatric RVAO is most commonly an anomalous bone formation of the rostral vertebral column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many bony anomalies have been associated with RVAO, including the "ponticulus posticus," a common anomaly of the C1 vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The definitive diagnosis of RVAO is made with dynamic angiography, and surgical decompression of the vertebral artery prevents recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ILLUSTRATIVE CASE: We report a 15-year-old boy with recurrent posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> caused by an anomalous ossification of the C1 vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) and multiplanar reconstructed CT images showed the anomalous C1 ossification, and cervicocerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed an associated vertebral artery (VA) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was initially managed by head immobilization in a hard collar and anticoagulation for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After healing of the dissection that was confirmed angiographically, dynamic DSA demonstrated reversible occlusion of the VA during contralateral head turn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression of the VA was performed and confirmed by intra-operative DSA with head turning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RVAO is an important diagnosis in children with posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our case demonstrates the need for high clinical suspicion and careful analysis of 3D cervical spine CT images in children with posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
