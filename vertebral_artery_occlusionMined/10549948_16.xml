<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are an uncommon but increasingly recognized cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with SAH caused by a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving both vertebral arteries as well as the basilar trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated successfully with proximal occlusion of the vertebral arteries using endovascular balloon occlusion in two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of early follow-up angiography to document progression or resolution of untreated dissections is emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach is suggested as definitive treatment for vertebrobasilar dissection in appropriate circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man presented with SAH from spontaneous vertebrobasilar dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed aneurysmal dilation of the right vertebral artery and basilar trunk and occlusion of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated with balloon occlusion of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography 2 weeks later demonstrated resolution of the left vertebral occlusion, with restoration of antegrade flow in the basilar trunk and increased filling of the right vertebral and basilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Balloon occlusion of the left vertebral artery led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and excellent clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bilateral vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are an uncommon cause of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If unilateral proximal vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is chosen as the initial treatment, it is essential to document the status of the contralateral vessel using follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Staged bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> should be considered in the event of recurrent or progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endovascular balloon occlusion has advantages over proximal clipping of the parent vessel: cranial nerve manipulation is avoided, test occlusion in the awake patient can be performed at the site of permanent occlusion, and therapeutic levels of anticoagulation can be maintained throughout and after the procedure, thus diminishing the likelihood of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
