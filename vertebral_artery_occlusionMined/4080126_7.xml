<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1976 and 1984, 11 patients with stab wounds at the craniocervical junction were seen in the Department of Neurosurgery at Groote Schuur Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The injury usually occurred in males, and the left side was predominantly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the anatomical features of this region, the penetrating instrument is deflected by the occipital squama into the atlantooccipital or atlantoaxial interspace, and an almost predictable syndrome occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dura mater is penetrated, so that cerebrospinal fluid leakage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> are common complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> occurred in 5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo> may develop at this site and did occur in 4 patients, but only 2 required surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the exposed position of the vertebral artery at this level, this vessel was injured in 4 patients; an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> developed in 2, vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 1, and a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit varied in magnitude, was often transient, affected the upper limbs more than the lower, was asymmetrical (suggestive of lateralized injury), and at times showed a remarkable tendency to recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the existence of this syndrome may help in forestalling complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only warning sign may be an insignificant wound in the suboccipital or retromastoid region </plain></SENT>
