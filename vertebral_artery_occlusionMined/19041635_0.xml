<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This animal study was designed to determine whether acupuncture improves motor function following experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied whether the outcome of motor function was associated with the expression of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), trkB (receptor, trkB) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or MCAO plus bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups studied were a control, treadmill exercise, electroacupuncture and a combined treatment group with both treadmill exercise and electroacupuncture (ExEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 16, Western blot analysis for BDNF and trkB and estimation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The motor behavior scores were measured 2 and 16-days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the motor scores among the groups showed that the motor scores in the exercise only group and ExEA group were higher than in the control group on postoperative day 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistical significance was found among the groups in the Western blot analysis and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates no significant additional effect of electroacupuncture on the motor recovery in rats following mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during the early recovery stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies in a rat model with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, assessment and reassessment for more extended periods after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> will be required </plain></SENT>
