<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar arteries that progressively enlarge causing symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> are dangerous and their treatment is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient with such an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treated successfully with staged, microsurgical occlusions of the proximal vertebral arteries is described, and the literature pertaining to this rare condition is briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old man with a fusiform basilar trunk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of uncertain etiology presented initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) of the posterior circulation that ceased with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four years later he presented again with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001618'>dysphonia</z:hpo> due to considerable enlargement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Staged microsurgical vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> proximal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second (left) vertebral artery was clipped only after the patient passed its temporary occlusion with an endovascular test balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> subsequently thrombosed, the distal basilar artery kept patent by a single (left) posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical condition improved markedly over a number of months as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> mass atrophied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Giant vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are rare but treacherous lesions, sometimes justifying aggressive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carefully selected patients with progressive and severe symptoms due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> may tolerate proximal vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, provided there is adequate collateral flow to the basilar termination and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of its perforating branches </plain></SENT>
