<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The literature on vascular trauma contains little information on the management of vertebral artery injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed our experience consisting of 23 patients with vertebral artery injuries caused by 19 gunshot wounds, two stab wounds, one shotgun wound, and one blunt injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients sustained unilateral vertebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, seven patients had vertebral AV fistulae (three jugular vein, four vertebral vein) and four patients sustained mural injury without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients (26.1%) developed major neurologic deficits of which five could be directly attributed to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> missile injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> on the basis of a vertebral AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven vertebral AV fistulae were managed solely by therapeutic embolization and two patients early in the series underwent surgical management alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had therapeutic embolization of the proximal vertebral artery and operative distal vertebral artery ligation for an AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four patients who died (17.4%) did so as a direct result of their <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> missile injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: 1) unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> seldom results in a neurologic deficit if there is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> contralateral vertebral artery and PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) blood supply is preserved; 2) accurate assessment of a vertebral artery injury requires contralateral vertebral arteriogram; 3) management of vertebral artery injury is simplified by proximal, and if possible distal, therapeutic embolization; 4) an anterior approach to the C1-2 vertebral artery is a satisfactory method of obtaining distal surgical control, obviating the need to unroof the bony canal of the vertebral artery; 5) angiography is necessary in penetrating neck trauma to identify occult vascular injuries </plain></SENT>
