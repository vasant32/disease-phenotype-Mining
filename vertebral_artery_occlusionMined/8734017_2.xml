<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether small communicating arteries or asymmetric vertebral arteries could predispose the brain stem to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> should such head movements occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 68 infants, the carotid, posterior communicating, precommunicator posterior cerebral, basilar and vertebral arteries were fixed in formalin, embedded in resin, the circumferences measured by image analysis, and the relative conductance of blood in each artery per gram of brain calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conductance in the vertebrobasilar and carotid systems lagged behind increases in brain weight during the postnatal growth spurt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 81% of infants, conductance through the communicating arteries was less than 25% of basilar artery conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conductance in one vertebral artery was less than half that of the contralateral artery in 41% of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the lag in available blood flow and small communicating and asymmetric vertebral arteries may predispose the infant brain stem to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> if one or both vertebral arteries are occluded by head rotation or extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because these head movements are likely to be accentuated in the prone sleeping position (a risk factor for sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome), we suggest that vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may underlie some cases of sudden unexpected infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
