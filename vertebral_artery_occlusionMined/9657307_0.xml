<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> is known to be caused by vertebrobasilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> (ex. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e>; VBI), an electrophysiological study was performed to examine the effects of a unilateral vertebral artery (VA) occlusion on the neuronal activities of the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) and vestibular ganglion (VG) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single neuronal activity in the MVN and VG was recorded extracellularly with a glass-insulated silver wire microelectrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the unilateral VA was occluded for 5 min. the spontaneous firing rate in the MVN was altered as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type A pattern exhibited a transient increase, followed by a decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The type B pattern showed a gradual decrease, and no further changes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type A and B patterns were observed respectively in MVN ipsi- and contra-lateral to the VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the VG neuronal firing rate was not affected by the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results seem to support the clinical suggestion that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> in VBI is produced by a difference in the function between the bilateral vestibular nuclei. rather than by the peripheral vestibular nerve </plain></SENT>
