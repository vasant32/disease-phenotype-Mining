<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, only five cases of vertebral artery injury associated with C1 fracture have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old man with diffuse spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> hit the top of his head and sustained a Jefferson fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) showed bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> associated with a Jefferson fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was placed in a halo vest for a total of 11 weeks and treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>Vertigo</z:hpo> gradually improved, and the patient was able to walk with a cane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previously <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> was completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that a Jefferson fracture can cause vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinician should be aware of the possibility and implications of vertebral artery injuries, especially if a fracture involving the foramen transversarium with displacement is documented or if there is a neurologic deficit above the level of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Advances in noninvasive imaging such as MRA will facilitate accurate evaluation of these potentially life-threatening vascular injuries </plain></SENT>
