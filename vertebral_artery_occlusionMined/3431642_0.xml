<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their initial symptoms were as follows: 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> (2 fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 1 giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>), 1 mass sign (giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>), and 1 ischemic sign (dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients, one with a giant and one with a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, preoperative proximal vertebral occlusion was carried out by inflated balloon for 30 to 100 minutes, under observation of clinical signs and measurement of distal arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This catheter technique with an inflated balloon provides the means to assess the effect of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the alert patient, and to determine if occlusion is tolerated or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case with a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the proximal vertebral artery was occluded extracranially with no complications and no recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other four patients (1 thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 2 fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 1 dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) whose contralateral vertebral arteries were hypoplastic, and who refused to operation, were treated conservatively for 6 months to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their outcomes were better than expected, with no recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> nor aggravation of clinical symptoms except for the one case with a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> whose deterioration was presumed attributable to late <z:hpo ids='HP_0008278'>cerebellar cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
