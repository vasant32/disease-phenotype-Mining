<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of vertebral artery injury diagnosed during the last 6 years in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and radiologic features of vertebral artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Extracranial occlusion of the vertebral artery associated with cervical spine fracture is uncommon and can cause serious and even fatal neurologic deficit due to back lifting and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography are extremely helpful in the examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injuries of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were performed at the time of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors reviewed six patients with cervical spine fractures who were diagnosed with a unilateral occlusion of the vertebral artery by means of magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> and another with complete cord lesion had cerebellar and back lifting infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> was performed in five patients, and one was treated by traction and orthosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of discharge, five patients had no vertebrobasilar symptoms, and the patient who experienced vertebrobasilar territory infarctions showed no progression of the neurologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery injury should be suspected in cervical trauma patients with facet <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>joint dislocation</z:hpo> or transverse foramen fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography is a helpful test to rule out vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vertebral artery injury affects the extracranial segment at the same level as the cervical fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective review that did not permit drawing conclusions about the effects of early surgical stabilization in the treatment of cervical spine injuries with associated vertebral artery injury; however, surgical stabilization may avoid propagation and embolization of the clot located at the site of the lesion </plain></SENT>
