<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bow hunter's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is typically due to mechanical compression or stretching of the dominant vertebral artery (VA) during contralateral head rotation against the bony elements of the atlas and axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> due to bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the left C3-4 and the right C1-2 junction on rightward head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old man experienced ischemic symptoms during 90Â° head rotation to the right with complete resolution of symptoms after returning his head to the neutral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dynamic cervical angiography with rightward head rotation showed severe compression of the right VA at the transverse foramen of C3-4 and mechanical stenosis of the left VA at the C1-2 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During head rotation, the flow of the right VA was decreased more than the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cervical 3-D computed tomography (CT) on rightward head rotation demonstrated displacement of the uncovertebral C3-4 joint, with excessive rotation of the C3 vertebral body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, instability at C3-4 was suspected to be the main cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior discectomy and fusion at the C3/4 level were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms, and dynamic cervical angiography showed disappearance of the compression of the right VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of bow hunter's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosed by dynamic cerebral angiography and cervical 3-D CT without angiography, and treated by anterior decompression and fusion without decompression of the VA </plain></SENT>
