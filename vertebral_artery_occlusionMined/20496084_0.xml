<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (FUANs) of vertebrobasilar arterial (VBA) trunk are difficult to treat by using current surgical and endovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of FUANs of VBA trunk which was treated with various therapeutic modalities including unilateral or bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with coils, stent-assistant coiling, or sole stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2008, 17 patients with FUANs (ranged in size from 8 to 45 mm) of VBA trunk in our hospital underwent endovascular treatment in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were evaluated by test occlusion with nondetachable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon or hyperglide balloon, and seven patients in this series passed testing with temporary balloon occlusion, among which four patients showed positive result, and three patients were conducted bilateral VA test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, nine patients underwent a trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by coils, four patients were treated with stent-supported coil embolization, and four patients with nonhemorrhagic FUAN of VBA were treated only by stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average imaging follow-up was 28 months, with a range from 6 to 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (82%) had excellent or good outcome, three (17.6%) had a poor outcome, and one (5.8%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Management of FUANs of VBA trunk often poses difficult therapeutic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some cases, multiple treatment sessions may be not only safe but also necessary for the effective treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> to achieve a complete or an acceptable result </plain></SENT>
