<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the head, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography (11 patients - repeated studies), 5 patients - conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VAD was located on extracranial (7), intracranial (1), extra-intracranial levels (4), the extension of dissection to the basilar artery was found in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissection involving both vertebral arteries was observed in 6 patients, recurrent VAD after 4-15 months - in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total number of VAD was 22, a total number of cerebrovascular events - 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (1) and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic cerebrovascular events were characterized by the combination of cerebral ischemic symptoms with occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and/or posterior neck pain (79%) which usually preceded ischemic cerebral symptoms by the interval of several hours - 3 weeks as well as a goof recovery of neurological deficit (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a half of patients, cerebral ischemic symptoms developed after neck movements or manual therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed the stenosis of vertebral arteries, usually elongated, irregular or tapered (64%), more often located at the level of V3-V4 segments, vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (36%) and pseudoaneurisms (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The repeated angiography performed in 2-3 months or more showed positive changes in 82%, the complete (86%) or partial (14%) resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stenoses and the complete or partial recanalization of the half of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, the regress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pseudoaneurisms </plain></SENT>
