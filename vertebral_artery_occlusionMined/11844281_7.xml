<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The carotid and the vertebrobasilar circulation were connected, effectively creating a new posterior communicating artery (PComA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomosis technique is a new anastomosis technique whereby formerly untreatable patients may be treated with an intracranial artery-to-intracranial artery bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report is the first one in which an angiographically proved patent internal carotid artery-posterior cerebral artery segment P1 bypass is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Our patient presented with repeated episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> because of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: An internal carotid artery-posterior cerebral artery segment P1 bypass procedure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the patient experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in the left cerebral hemisphere at the end of postoperative angiography procedure, no radiological intervention was performed, and the patient refused to undergo a new radiological intervention at a later stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUES: Both anastomoses were made using the excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomosis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoperative flowmetry was performed using an ultrasound flowmeter, which disclosed blood flow of 35 ml/min through the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hope that this new PComA suffices to protect the patient from infarction in the territory of the vertebrobasilar circulation </plain></SENT>
