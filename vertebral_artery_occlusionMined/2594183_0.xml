<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two of nine, both vertebral arteries were occluded and in five of the nine, the basilar artery was also blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> occluded arteries showed absence of flow void and were clearly demonstrated as mildly hypo- approximately mildly hyperintense structures to brainstem parenchyma on the T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of five patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, retrograde filling of the distal basilar artery was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, in particular the T1-weighted image, is a pertinent diagnostic modality for evaluating intracranial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
