<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) on a consecutive cohort of patients with cervical spine injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical and radiographic features of vertebral artery injury/occlusion associated with nonpenetrating cervical spine trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With the popularization of MRA, vertebral artery injury has been a common complication of cervical spine trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, detailed clinical features such as restoration of blood flow in occluded vessels and collateral circulation have not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 2-year period, 64 consecutive patients with cervical spine fractures and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated for patency of the vertebral artery and collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracranial and intracranial MRAs were conducted at initial injury and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 11 patients, including 10 with unilateral and 1 with bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the patient with bilateral occlusion was symptomatic but had no permanent neurologic deficit as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He had complete circle of Willis, which provides sufficient collateral blood supply from anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRAs revealed restoration of blood flow in occluded vessel(s) in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had compressive injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of traumatically induced vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 17.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The potential for blood flow restoration was higher in compressive injuries than in distractive injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of occlusion in compressive injuries is likely to be vasospasm or minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>, which may cause reversible occlusion because vessels are subjected to relatively minor stretching in compressive injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was rarely symptomatic because of sufficient collateral blood supply through not only contralateral vertebral artery but also the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
