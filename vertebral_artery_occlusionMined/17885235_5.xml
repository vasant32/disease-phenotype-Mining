<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to report the incidence, clinical presentation, and midterm clinical and imaging results of endovascular treatment of 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and January 2007, 2112 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 10 patients were located on the vertebrobasilar junction and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (70%) were associated with proximal basilar fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 5 men and 5 women, ranging from 29 to 75 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and one was a giant partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with mass effect on the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by primary coil occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One giant unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was initially treated with bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 2 months later followed by selective coil occlusion of the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> lumen via the posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At imaging follow-up of 6-30 months in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were adequately occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, the vertebrobasilar junction and distal vertebral arteries (including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) thrombosed completely on follow-up without clinical sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vertebrobasilar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are rare, with an incidence of 0.5% of treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are frequently associated with proximal basilar fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment is effective and safe in excluding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> from the circulation </plain></SENT>
