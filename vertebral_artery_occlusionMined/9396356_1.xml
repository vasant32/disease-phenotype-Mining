<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 9 patients with bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BVAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BVAO was confirmed using angiography in order to clarify its clinical feature, mechanism, and long term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed bilateral intra-cranial occlusion, 3 bilateral extra-cranial occlusion, and 3 intra and extra-cranial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was fed by the posterior communicating artery in 8 out of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of the 8, reconstitution of the thyrocervical artery was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into 4 groups according to MRI findings, as follows: Group 1 with no abnormal finding on MRI (N = 2); Group 2 with deep pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and non-territorial small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (N = 2); Group 3 with extended pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (N = 3); and Group 4 with cerebellar cortical artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, deep pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and non-territorial small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (N = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient episodes were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 8 patients out of 9 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>/dizziness, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 2 numbness, and 1 hearing disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These episodes preceded a final attack or complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2 days to 5 months, and those who had a longer period of episodes in the preceding term tended to have less severe deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients had vertebro-basiler symptoms after being in the upright position, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients in Groups 2 and 4, which had cerebellar border zone/terminal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the hemodynamic mechanism plays an important role in BVAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was not always grave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of the patients could walk independently, 2 could walk with a cane, and 3 were bed ridden (2 of which died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up data (a mean of 5 years) were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the patients who could walk, one had asymptomatic cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with BVAO often also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and/or preceding episode and show cerebellar border zone/terminal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This research strongly suggests that hemodynamic mechanism might play an important role in BVAO, and that paying attention to border zone infarction in MRI and transient episodes can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
