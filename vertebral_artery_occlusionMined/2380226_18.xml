<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography was performed after the orthopaedic management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This demonstrated vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (one bilateral) in five of the seven patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> and in four of the five patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the nine patients with vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had neurological deficits above the level of the injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which resolved spontaneously within two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our experience, a distraction-flexion injury appears to be the most common cause of closed traumatic vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
