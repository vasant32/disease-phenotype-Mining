<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to investigate whether H(2)S attenuates the neuronal injury induced by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min three times in an interval of 5 min to induce VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An H(2)S donor, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29919">hydrosulfide</z:chebi> (NaHS) or an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-beta-synthase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15429">hydroxylamine</z:chebi> (HA) was administered intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of neurons in the hippocampus was determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, and the performance of learning and memory was tested by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H(2)S content in plasma was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampus was assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Bcl-2 and Bax expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuronal injury occurred gradually with a decreased number of neurons and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> ratio in the hippocampus over 720 h after VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The H(2)S level was also gradually decreased in plasma over 720 h after VD, which negatively correlated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> ratio in the hippocampus after VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, NaHS treatment significantly attenuated neuronal injury and improved neural functional performance, whereas HA exaggerated the neuronal injury and exacerbated learning and memory at 720 h after VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NaHS treatment markedly improved the ratio of Bcl-2 over Bax with increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HA reduced the ratio of Bcl-2 over Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that H(2)S attenuates VD injury via inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and may have potential therapeutic value for VD </plain></SENT>
