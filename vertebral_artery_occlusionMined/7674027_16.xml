<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With head rotation of 45 degrees or more to the right, the patient would become lightheaded and feel as if she were going to lose consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography performed when head rotation was to the right revealed mechanical compression of the left vertebral artery at the foramen transversarium of the axis and an occluded right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Untethering of the vertebral artery as it passed through the foramen transversarium of the atlas in this case completely relieved the patient's symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that contralateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> predisposed this patient to symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> secondary to ipsilateral vertebral artery mechanical stenosis induced by head turning </plain></SENT>
