<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transverse process fracture from C6 to C1 has been reported as a high risk factor for vertebral artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused by transverse process fracture of C7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 22-year-old man was admitted to our hospital after a motor-cycle accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial computed tomography (CT) at the C7 level revealed soft-tissue swelling of the neck and right transverse process fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, a bony fragment protruding in the anterolateral direction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) image showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) revealed right vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the V1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vertebral artery angiography revealed right vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery, and retrograde flow of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin and discharged 28 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A follow up MRA at 2 months after admission demonstrated no change in right vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and he was still asymptomatic 3 months after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the transverse process fracture of C7 complicated with soft-tissue swelling of the neck could cause vertebral artery injury, and MRA and angiography are recommended for diagnosis and treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
