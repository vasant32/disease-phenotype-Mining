<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Blunt injuries to the vertebral artery (BVI) are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent improvements in the multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) technology and increased use of screening protocols have led to a greater number of these injuries identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Well-defined treatment recommendations are still lacking, and it is unclear whether screening and treatment lead to improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who met predefined screening criteria were screened for BVI with a MDCT angiogram (MDCT-A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients identified with BVI were treated based on injury grade and associated injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hospital course, morbidity, mortality, and follow-up were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8,292 patients were admitted for blunt injuries during this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients were found to have 47 BVI (three bilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (AC)-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-or an antiplatelet agent-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin-was initiated in 37 patients (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic coiling was performed in eight patients (18%), and two (5%) had endovascular stents placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (9%), of whom three died and one recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality rate was 16% (7/44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BVI-related mortality occurred in three patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these, two patients had bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or transaction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was considered nonpreventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in a patient with a unilateral vertebral dissection developed a posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was felt to be contraindicated in this patient initially due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This was deemed the only potentially preventable BVI-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Annual BVI-related mortality rate in the 4 years before initiating the screening protocol was 0.75 cases per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>During this study period, it was 0.57 cases per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Under an aggressive screening and individualized treatment protocol for BVI, we had very few potentially preventable BVI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We are unable to conclude; however, based on historical controls that either screening or treatment improved overall outcome </plain></SENT>
