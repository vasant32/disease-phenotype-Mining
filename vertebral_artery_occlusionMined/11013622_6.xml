<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rheumatoid patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlanto-axial subluxation</z:hpo> presents a major challenge to the spinal surgeon, owing to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001058'>poor wound healing</z:hpo> and bone quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional wiring techniques are associated with a high complication and failure rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posterior transarticular screw fixation of the atlanto-axial joint offers a credible alternative and when combined with a Gallie construct offers immediate true 3-point stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is, however, a difficult and demanding technique which carries a risk of vertebral artery, cranial nerve and spinal cord damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The question that arises therefore is "Do the improved stability rates afforded by this technique really justify the risks of arterial and neurological damage?" To date there have been no studies of this technique dealing solely with the rheumatoid patient, with most reports dealing with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patient population, mainly trauma-related cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to analyse critically our results with particular reference to the complications that we have encountered and the technical reasons for their occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analysed the clinical and radiological data of 38 rheumatoid patients (six males: 32 females, mean age of 54 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlanto-axial subluxation</z:hpo> who underwent transarticular screw fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our analysis centred on screw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parametric and non parametric statistical analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significance was accepted at the 5% level (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed that three vertebral arteries were damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of these were recognized at the time of surgery, with the remaining case only suspected following postoperative CT to assess screw positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was subsequently confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were asymptomatic from their arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was only one neurological complication in this series, and this was caused by a high screw, which damaged the hypoglossal nerve with a temporary nerve palsy ensuing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four screws broke, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were made of <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi>, but more importantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were also associated with contralateral screw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Stability was achieved in 95% of cases overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The high stability rates afforded by this technique do appear to justify the inherent risks of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If unilateral screw fixation only is achieved, we would recommend a period of halo immobilization until osseous union occurs </plain></SENT>
