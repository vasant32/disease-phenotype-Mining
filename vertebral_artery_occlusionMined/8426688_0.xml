<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic changes after occlusion therapy are suspected to be responsible for these phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is usually difficult to solve these problems or to predict them before operation because multiple factors are related in a complex fashion in a living body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the effective means is to simulate these hemodynamic conditions by a hydraulic vascular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate hemodynamics after gradual therapeutic occlusion of the vertebral artery, a glass sphere of 2.5 cm in diameter was placed in a hydraulic model and regarded as a VA-PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dye was injected into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and intensity change of the transmitted light was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Half-life of the dye was calculated from the thus-obtained clearance curve and was regarded as an index of intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> stagnation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The flow volumes of each arterial site have been estimated in our previous study: 60 ml/min to the territory of one posterior cerebral artery, and 80 ml/min to the cerebellum and the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clearance curves were recorded in the following various conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The flow value of the PICA was set to be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ml/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
