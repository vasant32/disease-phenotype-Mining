<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 53 patients investigated with vertebral angiography over a 5 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was significantly abnormal in 32 patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five (9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissections</z:e>, nine (17%) had unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, two had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269766" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 (30%) had vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12 stenoses were considered suitable for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>11 patients were anticoagulated (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between clinical features, site of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> that would have allowed the prediction of the findings in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that using vertebral angiography to investigate posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> will identify a significant number of potentially treatable lesions </plain></SENT>
