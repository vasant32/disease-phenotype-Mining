<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A vascular model of the vertebrobasilar system with a basilar head <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four types of occlusion were simulated: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> distal to (Type A), between (Type B) and proximal to (Type C) the superior cerebellar arteries, and bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (Type D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> solution was perfused into the model, and the half-life of the dye injected into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was calculated and regarded as an index of stagnant flow in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The half-life was increased significantly and nonlinearly after parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, depending on the occlusion site and the ratio of two PCom diameters (diameter ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-aneurysmal stagnation developed markedly in Type A and Type B in the diameter ratio higher than 0.70 and considerably in Type C in the ratio higher than 0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional P1 occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery enhanced the stagnation in Type A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the results are consistent with the published clinical data, the simulation study will be useful for speculating the efficacy of the therapeutic occlusion </plain></SENT>
