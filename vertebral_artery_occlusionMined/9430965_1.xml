<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 67-year-old male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative DSA study revealed a right subclavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, a brachiocephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, stenosis of the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, and occlusion of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intraoperative occlusion test of the right vertebral artery showed a decline of the brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) seven minutes after the start of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by femoral arterial and bicaval cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under selective cerebral perfusion by cannulation of both common caroid arteries, a partial aortic arch replacement was performed using a graft patch with 3 branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These three branches were connected to the right subclavian artery and to both common carotid arteries, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> the right vertebral artery was reconstructed with the saphenous vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proximal anastomosis between the saphenous vein graft and the right caroid graft was done perfusion from a branch of the saphenous vein graft in order to shorten ischemic time of basilar arterial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was weaned from bypass without problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After weaning the BAER test was again performed and found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative DSA examination showed good blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the reconstructed vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and shortening of ischemic time of the basilar arterial region are effective in preventing ischemic injury of the brain stem and the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
