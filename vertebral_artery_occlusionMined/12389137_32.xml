<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyze the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings and evaluate their correlations with clinical symptoms in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100561'>spinal cord lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images and clinical features of 16 patients (11 male, 5 female) with typical sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deficits caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed within 2 h to 14 days after the initial neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had follow-up examinations including contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> abnormalities were best demonstrated on sagittal T2-weighted images, with "pencil-like" hyperintensities (16/16) and cord enlargement (9/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Axial T2-weighted images showed bilateral (13/16) and unilateral (3/16) hyperintensities according, in 15 patients, to anterior spinal artery (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) territory, with three of them located particularly in the spinal sulcal artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient only the posterior spinal artery (PSA) territory was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord was affected at the cervical level (especially C2-C3) in seven patients, at the upper thoracic level (T3-T5) in two patients and at the thoracolumbar region including the conus medullaris (T10-L1) in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presumed etiologies were vascular surgery (3 patients), infrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (1 patient), bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (1 patient), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (1 patient), spine operation (1 patient), excessive cocaine misuse (1 patient) and cardioembolic vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1 patient); six of seven patients with unclear etiologies had vascular risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is therefore useful in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e>, with axial T2-weighted images showing hyperintensities in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> territory in 15 of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the presumed spinal cord watershed at the lower cervical and upper thoracic level, and despite numerous central arteries in the cervical cord, our data suggest a high ischemic vulnerability of the cervical spinal cord at level C2-C3 </plain></SENT>
