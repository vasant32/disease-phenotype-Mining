<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was conducted using chi-square testing of a two-way classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the incidence of vertebral artery injuries associated with cervical spine trauma, and to determine the value of various factors in predicting the existence of a vertebral artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: During a 7-month period, 61 patients (41 male patients, 20 female; average age, 40.3 years) with cervical spine trauma were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted to the authors' hospital with cervical spine injuries underwent magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of their cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> magnetic resonance angiographies were examined for vertebral artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on demographics and the injury were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete disruption of blood flow through the vertebral artery was demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography in 12 of the 61 patients (19.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 12 patients (83%) had either flexion distraction or flexion compression injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, mechanism of injury, neurologic impairment, and associated injuries were not statistically significant in predicting the presence of a vertebral vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings in this study may support the need for vertebral vessel evaluation in selective patients, particularly those with flexion injuries and with neurologic symptoms consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery insufficiency</z:e> syndrome that do not correlate with the presenting bone and soft-tissue injuries </plain></SENT>
