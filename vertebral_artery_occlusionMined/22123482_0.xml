<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomography scans showed a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> associated with midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies showed prolongation of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and undetectably low level of fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until the present episode, she had received plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate around menstruation and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had also suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> due to vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burr-hole evacuation and drainage of CSDH was successfully performed using fibrinogen concentrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of CSDH with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001733" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">afibrinogenemia</z:e> is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the past repeated administrations of fibrinogen concentrate were suspected to generate CSDH, paradoxical thrombotic complications caused by upregulation of prothrombin activation, thrombin generation, and growth factors released from platelets might be related to the development of CSDH with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital afibrinogenemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
