<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the interobserver reliability of brain and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in older community subjects previously recruited to a case-control study of dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects aged over 65 years were identified through a local survey and advertising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several investigations were performed, including MRI of the head and neck using a Siemens 1.5 Tesla machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were coded independently by two consultant neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was calculated using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 246 participants, scans from 84 dizzy subjects and 79 non-dizzy subjects were available for coding by two neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement was "fair" for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, "good" for white matter lesions (WML) in the cerebral hemispheres, and moderate for WML in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement for cervical spine disease ranged from "moderate" (severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e>) to "poor" (vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interobserver variability in the evaluation of brain and cervical cord MRI was substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of standardized scores, particularly for disease of the cervical cord, may improve interobserver reliability </plain></SENT>
