<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of unilateral VA occlusion on blood regulation in the brainstem and the inner ear, using laser-Doppler flowmetry in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemical control was evaluated by blood flow response to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation, and autoregulation by that to induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: i) Unilateral VA occlusion impairs chemical control and autoregulation of brainstem blood flow and affects autoregulation in the inner ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ii) Unilateral VA occlusion damages the potential for blood flow regulation more strongly in the brainstem than in the inner ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that occlusive disease within the vertebro-basilar system leads to the impairment of blood flow regulation in both the brainstem and the inner ear-more strongly in the brainstem-possibly contributing to symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and hearing disturbance, at least in certain groups of patients when hemodynamic factors such as systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> are added </plain></SENT>
