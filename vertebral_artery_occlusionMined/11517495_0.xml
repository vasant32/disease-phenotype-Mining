<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its natural history and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report a young patient with repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the posterior cerebral circulation caused by dissection of the vertebral artery, which was not detected on the first angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The otherwise healthy 22-year-old male suddenly developed visual disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological examination revealed right occipital infarction, but cerebral aniography revealed no caliber change or other pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was treated with antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two years later, he suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> due to newly developed left cerebellar and medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed left vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image demonstrated Gadlinium-enhanced intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the occluded left vertebral artery, which was compatible to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present case argues serial neuroimaging studies especially in young patients with vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in order to rule out the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo>, even if initial angiography failed to demonstrate any radiographical evidence </plain></SENT>
