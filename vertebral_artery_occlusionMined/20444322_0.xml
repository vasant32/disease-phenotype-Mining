<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two patients with VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, who were treated endovascularly between 2001 and 2008, were retrospectively studied to identify patients presenting LCNP without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCNP occurred in 12 patients (16·7%) initially caused by VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: four located at vertebral artery-posteroinferior cerebellar artery (PICA) complex, seven at distal to PICA segment and one at proximal to PICA segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, ten patients were diagnosed as having dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the intracranial VA, and two were diagnosed having saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated by sole stent placement, five patients were treated by stent coil embolization and five were treated by vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nosocomial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> did not occur in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-operative LCNP resolved completely within 6 months in nine patients (75%) and within 9 months in ten patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two (1·9%) patients died of aneurismal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study can help to identify the effect and natural history of LCNP caused by VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These lesions can be effectively treated by endovascular embolization, even by VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
