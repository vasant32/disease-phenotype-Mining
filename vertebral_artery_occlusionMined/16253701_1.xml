<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basillary artery BA is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mortality rate is high, management remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 2 cases of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the BA presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), both of which were successfully treated using staged occlusion of bilateral vertebral arteries (VAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman presented with SAH associated with ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endovascular occlusion of a single VA, blood flow in the dissected lumen was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rebled and the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> of the other did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vertebral arteries were also occluded using endovascular techniques at 4 and 2 weeks after initial treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the second intervention, stump pressure ratios of VAs intended for occlusion were 62.5% and 50.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients tolerated temporary occlusion of bilateral VAs well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent permanent occlusion of bilateral VAs resulted in no neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete obliteration of the aneurysmal lumen was demonstrated on magnetic resonance angiography performed 72 and 5 months later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Staged bilateral VA occlusion might be the last recourse to prevent further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from BA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The technique can be safely applied when the stump pressure ratio is 50.6% or greater and when the patient tolerates temporary occlusion, which suggests the existence of sufficient collateral flow from the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
