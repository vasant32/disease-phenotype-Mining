<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To establish the diagnostic criteria for the site of occlusion in the vertebral arteries (VAs) using duplex color-coded ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 128 consecutive patients who underwent conventional cerebral angiography, we prospectively measured the diameter, mean flow velocity (MV), peak systolic flow velocity, and end-diastolic flow velocity of both VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diameter-ratio (diameter of contralateral VA divided by that of target VA) and MV-ratio (MV of contralateral VA divided by that of target VA) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the angiographic findings, we classified the VAs into 4 types (5 groups) as follows: (1) the origin of VA occlusion (Origin group: n=9); (2) VA occlusion before branching into the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (Before group: n=10); (3A) symptomatic VA occlusion after branching into the PICA (After group: n=12); (3B) asymptomatic or hypoplastic occlusive VA after branching into the PICA (PICA end group: n=15); and (4) no significant occlusive lesions in the VA (Control group: n=194) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No flow signals in the VAs apparently indicated the Origin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preserved peak systolic flow velocity but end-diastolic flow velocity of zero cm/s indicated the Before group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MV &lt;18 cm/s and MV-ratio &gt; or =1.4 indicated the PICA end group or After group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these groups could be distinguished as follows: a diameter-ratio &lt;1.4 indicated the After group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diameter-ratio &gt; or =1.4 indicated the PICA end group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Either MV &gt; or =18 cm/s or MV &lt;18 cm/s in combination with MV-ratio &lt;1.4 indicated the Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Duplex color-coded ultrasonography can accurately diagnose the site of VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
