<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated haemodynamic effects of therapeutic vertebral artery (VA) occlusion on giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the bifurcation of the VA-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An hydraulic model of the human vertebro-basilar artery was manufactured from glass and <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glass-spheres 2.5 cm in diameter were placed at the bifurcation as model <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with respective distances of 8.5, 7.5, 6.5 and 5.5 mm between the VA union and aneurysmal neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 40% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> solution was perfused in this system and the half-life of the dye injected into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was regarded as an index of intra-aneurysmal stagnation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow conditions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> depended on the presence or absence of the effect of contralateral VA flow as well as the PICA flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The half-life increased significantly after VA occlusion proximal to the PICA when the aneurysmal neck was more than 7.5 mm away from the VA union and PICA flow volume was less than 12 ml min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The half-life in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located within 6.5 mm from the union changed little after VA occlusion regardless of the PICA flow volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haemodynamic simulation study would be helpful in speculating on the efficacy of this treatment </plain></SENT>
