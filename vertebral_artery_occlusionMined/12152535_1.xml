<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report on their results with local intraarterial thrombolysis in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Three patients suffered from vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and one from carotid-T occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with local intraarterial thrombolysis by a joint team of neurologist, neuroanaesthesist and interventional neuroradiologist in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-department of St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stephen Municipal Hospital in collaboration with National Institute of Neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selection of patients suitable for successful intraarterial thrombolysis has to be done in the neurological department with help of ultrasound and neurological examination and CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were transferred to the therapeutic angiosuit and interventional treatment was initiated immediately upon establishing the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one million units of urokinase was infused directly into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete recanalisation was achieved in three of the four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That was associated with full recovery in two patients, in whom good collateral circulation and no signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were found prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Another patients has died despite of full recanalisation of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient survived after partial recanalisation of bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with mild residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local intraarterial thrombolysis is effective and is associated with good clinical outcome in properly selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful and accurate ultrasound diagnostics of the site of occlusion plays a significant role in proper patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although difficult, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraarterial thrombolysis can be organized in a timely fashion even utilizing the required facilities in two different institutions, providing that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efforts is being made by each party for the fast diagnosis and treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
