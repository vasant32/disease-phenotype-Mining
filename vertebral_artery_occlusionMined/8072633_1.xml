<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rotational contralateral (to the face) vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is considered to be a "physiological phenomenon" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present article is to investigate whether stenosis or occlusion of the vertebral artery at the atlantoaxial joint really occurs with head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors performed vertebral angiography both in the neutral position and with contralateral rotation of the head (about 80 - 90 degrees) on 39 patients (44 vertebral arteries), who didn't have any disease of the cervical region or of the posterior cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors discussed the angiographic findings concerning the vertebral artery at the atlantoxial joint during contralateral rotation of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cases a vertebral artery was stretched with head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However occlusion or stenosis of the vertebral artery was never found to occur at the atlantoaxial joint level in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that rotational vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is not a "physiological phenomenon" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There may be many other developmental and degenerative factors contributing to this rotational occlusion, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, kinking, and tortuosity of the vertebral artery, hyperosteosis, tightness of the paravertebral muscle, stenosis of transverse foramen and the depth of the vascular groove of the atlas </plain></SENT>
