<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autopsy examination of the intracranial and extracranial portions of the vertebral arteries in the case presented here clearly demonstrates that intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> arising within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> in the tunica media was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, occlusive event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, prior neck manipulation may have caused asymptomatic development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> within the tunica media, thereby predisposing the patient to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> during subsequent neck manipulation </plain></SENT>
