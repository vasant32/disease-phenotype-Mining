<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, insufficient neurodiagnostic technology and a lack of normative data for the population of USAF aviators prevented recommending flying waivers following such vascular injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of an aviator who experienced a traumatic right vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Timely access to a state-of-the-art neurodiagnostic evaluation, which included time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and standard contrast angiography, provided anatomic imaging at the time of injury and during the recuperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sophisticated neurologic testing protocols at the Armstrong Laboratory's Aeromedical Clinical Sciences Division, Brooks Air Force Base, TX, assessed in-depth this individual's functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consult Service evaluators then compared his performance data with current data in the Head Injury Study in Aviators (HISA) data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA, in comparison with standard contrast angiography, demonstrated anatomic stability of his vascular and neurologic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He demonstrated a functional capacity consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurologic functioning in aviators which permitted recommending an occupational (flying) waiver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case exemplified application of sophisticated ACS neurologic testing protocols to aeromedical evaluations and the use of MRA technology as a vascular screening tool during medical followup </plain></SENT>
