<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anterior aspect of the cervical spine was exposed, the small medial parts of two adjoining pedicles were removed and the VA was occluded by a small hemoclip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The vertebral artery was successfully occluded in 36 experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 22 animals the occlusion was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The technique proved to be very reliable and rather easy </plain></SENT>
