<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that structural abnormalities of the brain and cervical cord are more common in dizzy than in non-dizzy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study of subjects over the age of 65 with and without dizziness: 125 dizzy subjects and 86 non-dizzy subjects were recruited from the community through articles in the local press </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and neck was performed, and was read by a consultant neuroradiologist blind to the clinical details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dizzy subjects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls had at least one structural abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>Cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> was found in 86% of dizzy subjects and 85% controls (p = 1.0) At least one white matter lesion was found in 69% of dizzy subjects and 78% controls (p = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions in the midbrain were more common in dizzy than in non-dizzy subjects (22% v 4%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003308'>cervical subluxation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847415" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facet joint degeneration</z:e>, vertebral artery compression, or vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> between dizzy and non-dizzy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Structural abnormalities of the brain and neck are common in both dizzy and non-dizzy subjects. "Routine" MRI is unlikely to reveal a specific cause for dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observation of more frequent white matter lesions in the midbrain in dizzy subjects requires further study to determine whether small vessel changes could cause dizziness in older people </plain></SENT>
