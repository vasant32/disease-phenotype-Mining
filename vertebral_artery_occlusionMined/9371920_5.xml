<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (mean age, 59 years) with basilar artery embolism participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score on admission was &lt; 7 in five patients, 7 to 12 in 11 patients, and &gt; 12 in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Etiologic factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (17 patients), vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (12 patients), cervical spine trauma (4 patients), embolism following angiography (2 patients), and surgery (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed in 17 patients and CT in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic examinations were initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 14 patients and remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> localization was the thalamus (36 patients), cerebellum (20 patients), posterior cerebral artery territory (21 patients), midbrain (12 patients), and pons (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight to 12 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 12 patients were without clinical signs (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] 1), 15 patients had minor neurologic deficits (GOS 2), 10 were severely disabled (GOS 3), and eight patients had died (GOS 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome correlated with GCS on admission (p &lt; 0.0001) and with the number of ischemic lesions (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The typical syndrome is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> followed by multiple brainstem symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Usually, clinical symptoms improve rapidly and, in some patients, completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with basilar occlusion, basilar embolism has a relatively low mortality and outcome is frequently excellent </plain></SENT>
