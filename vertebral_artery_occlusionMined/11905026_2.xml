<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a bilateral vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proximal ligation of the vertebral artery on the ruptured side combined with wrapping of the contralateral dissection failed to prevent fatal rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since enlargement of the contralateral dissection was observed by postoperative angiography, rupture of the growing contralateral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may have caused rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic changes following the occlusion of one vertebral artery might have led to enlargement and subsequent rupture of the contralateral dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct wrapping was unable to prevent enlargement of the dissection, so radical surgery including bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with vascular reconstruction may be the treatment of choice for this type of lesion </plain></SENT>
