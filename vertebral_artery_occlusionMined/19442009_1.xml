<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The object of this study was to describe an unusual fracture subtype within C-1 injuries with a propensity to result in late deformity and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients with C-1 injuries are nonsurgically treated using external immobilization unless there is an injury of the transverse atlantal ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe an unusual variant involving a unilateral sagittal split with a high tendency to late deformity and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They also review the literature and treatment of C-1 fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 12,671 CT scans from a Level I trauma center over a 6-year period yielded 54 patients with C-1 fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 6 had an unusual unilateral lateral mass sagittal split, which resulted in a late cock-robin deformity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors and thus a surgical deformity correction with occipital-cervical instrumented fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient charts and radiographs were reviewed, this fracture subtype is described, and its treatment discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radiographic studies in 6 patients with C-1 fractures demonstrated a unilateral sagittal split of the lateral mass but an intact transverse atlantal ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 3 surviving patients, a late cock-robin deformity, significant loss of neck rotation, and severe neck pain developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, as revealed on CT angiography, occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were placed in traction and underwent successful occipital-cervical fusion and deformity correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the final follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had satisfactory pain relief and improved head alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a unilateral sagittal split of the C-1 lateral mass have unstable injuries and must be carefully monitored, with a low threshold for surgical reconstruction or prolonged traction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with late deformity can be successfully treated with occipital-cervical instrumented fusions </plain></SENT>
