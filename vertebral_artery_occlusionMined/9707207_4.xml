<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a rare complication of generalized surgery (1% to 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unexpected difficulties with tracheal intubation (TI), as well as the hyperextended position, may predispose a patient to or play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify blood flow changes in carotid and vertebral arterial circulation during simulated TI and develop profile models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk before possible generalized surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty consecutive patients with suspected cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or pending surgery underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with flow analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulated TI position was maintained for 3 to 4 minutes per acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 89 females (56%) and 71 males (44%) with a mean age of 66 years (range, 17 to 89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoplastic vertebral arteries with flow less than 50 mL/s were present in 40 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Profound alteration in basilar artery flow was noted in this group with increased frequency of microinfarctions on MRI (77% versus 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unsuspected carotid occlusion (n=6) and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=2) were associated with significant basilar artery flow changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow reversal was present in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid arterial changes were not significant with simulated TI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No overt ischemic symptoms developed during these maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simulated TI is safe yet induces distinct and potentially detrimental flow abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individuals identified with the biological markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, carotid and vertebral occlusion, severe stenosis, or prior ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> should receive special attention to neck position not only during surgery but also in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sustained neck hyperextension greater than 12 minutes appears to be a neglected potential hemodynamic factor that may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
