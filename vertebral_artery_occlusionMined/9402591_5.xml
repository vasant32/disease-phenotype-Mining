<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Bow hunter's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> as a result of mechanical occlusion or stenosis of the vertebral artery at the C1-C2 level by head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, a dominant vertebral artery is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No case of bow hunter's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a result of mechanical occlusion of a nondominant vertebral artery has ever been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We describe a rare case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> caused by occlusion of a nondominant vertebral artery induced by head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> of the left face and the right extremities when he rotated his head 45 degrees or more to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Dynamic angiography revealed that the left vertebral artery was smaller than the right, terminated in a branch of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery, and was stretched and completely occluded at the C1-C2 level with the head rotated 45 degrees to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The right vertebral artery was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when the head was rotated to either the right or the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional enhanced computed tomography with the head rotated 45 degrees to the right revealed that the left vertebral artery was stretched and occluded by dislodgment between C1 and C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow scintigraphy with head rotation demonstrated that blood flow was decreased in the lower portion of the left cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C1-C2 posterior fixation was performed to prevent life-threatening neurological accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We emphasize that the diagnosis of bow hunter's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should be based not only on angiographic findings but also on hemodynamic studies with head rotation </plain></SENT>
