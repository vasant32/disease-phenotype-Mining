<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BP and CBF showed little change by unilateral VA occlusion alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> induced by venesection not only reduced CBF but also caused imbalance between bilateral CBF reduction rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF changed independently of BP, indicating the existence of a local CBF regulatory system </plain></SENT>
