<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While noninvasive tests such as Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have failed to provide reliable criteria for the diagnosis of VAD, the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has not yet been undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish the reliability of a combined noninvasive approach, 11 patients were prospectively examined for VAD by means of colour-coded duplex studies, MRI and three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA prior to conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 11 patients with VAD suspected clinically as well as on Doppler ultrasonography, angiography confirmed the diagnosis in seven patients but found a vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in three and a vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of MRI and MRA findings led to the correct diagnosis of dissection in three patients, of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in three patients, and of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VAD was misinterpreted as vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable screening method for the detection of vertebral artery pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of VAD can only be established if a typical intramural vessel wall haematoma is seen on T1-weighted MRI in combination with MRA findings of irregular <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion </plain></SENT>
