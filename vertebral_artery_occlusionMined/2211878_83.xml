<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution and time course of postischemic astrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and the relationship to neuronal viability or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was studied in rats subjected to 30 min of carotid and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion from 3 h to 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intermediate filaments (IFs) were evaluated by electron microscopy, IF proteins by immunohistochemistry, and astrocyte division by [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) increased in damaged and nondamaged brain regions by 2 days and was associated with cell enlargement, increases in IF, and transformation of GFAP-negative into GFAP-positive glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and increased GFAP persisted only in regions of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> whereas the number and size of GFAP-positive astrocytes returned to control levels in nondamaged regions by 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was not seen until 3 days and was confined to damaged brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vimentin-positive astrocytes were numerous by 2 days in damaged brain and remained only in those regions at 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> develops in undamaged brain, but is reversible with prolonged survival, whereas reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> that accompanies structural brain damage persists for prolonged periods and is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the results show that astrocyte expression of vimentin is more specific than GFAP in identifying regions of permanent ischemic injury during the early postischemic period </plain></SENT>
