<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Posterior circulation in 82 children of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease are studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two aspects of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease, (ie; occlusive lesion of cerebral vessels and the development of abnormal vascular network as collateral channel,) are also detected in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 82 cases, 49 cases showed the occlusion of posterior cerebral artery at their quadrigeminal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three showed the more proximal occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were found in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the occlusive lesion progresses, abnormal vascular network at the posterior portion of skull base developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This network consists mainly of thalamogeniculate artery, posterior choroidal artery, and also of other thalamoperforators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>Visual field defect</z:hpo> as an ischemic symptom of occipital lobe was detected in 9 cases (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and encephalo-myo-synangiosis (temporal muscle graft), which were not considered to be so effective to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the posterior circulation, were shown to exert indirect redistribution effect upon the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this effect is such an indirect one that these surgical treatments cannot prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, omentum transplantation to the occipital lobe may be needed as a method of direct revascularization </plain></SENT>
