<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The indications for bevacizumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor) have been expanded recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite concerns for cerebrovascular events from bevacizumab treatment, detailed clinical and radiologic information are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the Mayo Clinic Rochester database (January 2006-September 2010), we identified bevacizumab-treated patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within 3 weeks of bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was assessed using the modified Rankin scale 3 months following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (median age 58 years, range 37-86) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients received bevacizumab for a median duration of 3 months (range 2-4 months) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, and developed cerebrovascular events that comprised intratumoral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n = 7), cerebral watershed infarction (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n = 1), and left vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which was adequately controlled with a single anti-hypertensive agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant increase in blood pressure was observed in nine patients during their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation as compared with their baseline outpatient readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients died within 3 months of these cerebrovascular events, and the remaining four patients had modest functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular events are early and serious complications that should be considered in bevacizumab-treated patients who present with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
