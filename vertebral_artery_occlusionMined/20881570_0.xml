<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rotational <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery syndrome</z:e> (RVAS) is a rare entity about which previously published studies are mostly limited to individual case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our decade-long experience with this syndrome in 9 patients with compression ranging from the occiput to C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized a posterior approach for lesions rostral to C4 and an anterior approach for lesions at or caudal to C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of a minimally invasive posterior cervical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient profile, operative indications, surgical approach, operative findings, complications, and long-term follow-up were reviewed and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average follow-up was 47 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures provided excellent outcomes by Glasgow Outcome Scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anterior approach had significantly less blood loss (187.5 mL vs 450 mL, P = .00016) and shorter hospitalization length (2 days vs 4.5 days; P = .0001) compared with the far-lateral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008462'>cervical instability</z:hpo> in the far-lateral approach cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As an alternative to the far-lateral surgery, a minimally invasive approach resulted in shorter hospitalization (2 days) and less blood loss (10 mL) while avoiding the complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008462'>cervical instability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and durability of 3 surgical approaches for RVAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proper examination, preoperative imaging, and surgical planning were necessary for a satisfactory outcome </plain></SENT>
