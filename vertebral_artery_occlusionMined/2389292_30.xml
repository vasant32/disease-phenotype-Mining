<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our study describes the early symptoms and signs of 85 patients with either basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or bilateral distal vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> documented by selective angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common prodromal symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, which occurred during the 2 weeks before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings of 49 patients were classified into proximal, middle, and distal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of these patients had additional vertebral artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fourth group was composed of 36 patients with bilateral distal vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without opacification of the basilar artery through a vertebral artery injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> was sudden in 20 patients; sudden, but preceded by prodromal symptoms in 11 patients; and progressive in 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> often had bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> had occlusion of the middle and distal basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An embolic origin of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from an arteriosclerotic vertebral artery lesion was assumed to be an important mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> reaching the basilar artery may not necessarily reach the top of the artery, but may also become lodged more proximally </plain></SENT>
