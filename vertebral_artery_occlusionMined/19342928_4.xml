<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the management and outcomes of patients with unilateral, asymptomatic vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (VAO) undergoing surgery for cervical fractures associated with subluxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The management of VAO is controversial with several treatment options available, including observation alone, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A chart review inclusive of the years 2004 to 2006 was performed to include patients who presented after nonpenetrating trauma with cervical fracture associated with subluxation requiring surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An associated asymptomatic VAO was also required for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients were male and the mean age was 26.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients suffered an associated spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent closed reduction before surgical stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent open reduction with stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient received treatment for VAO before reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative treatment for VAO was variable, with 5 of 8 patients undergoing observation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients were treated with aspirin therapy, although 1 patient received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> intravenously for 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced an ischemic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of a fracture, whether closed or open, without treatment of an associated asymptomatic VAO seems safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Postoperative management of VAO consisting of either observation alone or aspirin therapy also seems to be a safe option </plain></SENT>
