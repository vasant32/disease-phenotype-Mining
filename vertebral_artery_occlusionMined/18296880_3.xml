<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging did not detect any contributing lesions with well-developed posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic radiography of the cervical spine showed mild instability at C5-6 and concomitant intramedullary hyperintensity confirmed by T(2)-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cervical computed tomography demonstrated an osseous protrusion in the right foramen transversarium at C5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dynamic cerebral angiography revealed simultaneous vertebral artery (VA) occlusion at C6 on the right and C5 on the left associated with leftward head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VA showed an intact course at the C1 to C2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent anterior fusion followed by decompressive foraminotomy at C5-6 and C6-7 and meticulous resection of the markedly thickened fibroligamentous structure which was considered to contribute to the rotational VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively he no longer suffered near-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> during head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hunter's syndrome</z:e> is an infrequent type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> that may need surgical management for potential threat of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dynamic cerebral angiography is a useful modality for evaluating bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hunter's syndrome</z:e> even if the patient cannot tolerate dynamic examination for the immediate symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accurate anatomical knowledge of the uncovertebral foraminal region combined with intraoperative dynamic study is essential for safe surgery to the VA and favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
