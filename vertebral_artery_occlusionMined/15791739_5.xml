<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are often extremely difficult, if not impossible, to treat with microneurosurgical clip reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As such, a Hunterian strategy via vertebral or basilar artery sacrifice is often used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have encountered a patient in whom deliberate bilateral vertebral artery sacrifice was insufficient to avoid progressive expansion of a giant dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a review of the literature, we are unaware of another reported case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man presented with signs and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> from a large fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving the distal dominant vertebral and proximal basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of angiographic evaluation were highly characteristic of underlying dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient was treated initially with staged bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and adjunctive posterior circulation revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After this therapy failed, he underwent a trapping procedure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unclippable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system are formidable lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They are not uniformly treatable by direct surgical reconstruction, and their growth is not consistently stabilized by the implementation of a complete Hunterian strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future developments related to the use of endovascular stent technology may offer a more successful treatment approach for patients with these complex cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
