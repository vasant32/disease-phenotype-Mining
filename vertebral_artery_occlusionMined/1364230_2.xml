<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCD had a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was also able to give functional data when combined with arteriography and correctly identified the main pathology in 92% of those with abnormal TCD and angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 patients with false negative TCD had vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which may be missed because of the signal from adjacent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD may be a useful screening method in patients with VBI for the detection of large vessel occlusive disease of the intracranial vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important to remember that proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265103" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery stenoses</z:e> will be missed by TCD </plain></SENT>
