<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of injury in these wounds is described as the kinetic energy transferred by the bullet, which always depends on its mass and speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the size of the pellet is the most important factor for the tissue damage, shock waves and direct injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Civilian gun shot wounds are generally caused by low velocity firearms, In this report, we described two cases with cervical gunshot wound characterized with transverse foramina damage and VA insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient was assaulted by bullet that resulted in vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, whereas a smaller pellet was found in the second one and arterial flow was not influenced on the site of the damaged transverse foramina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful management of these injuries should include careful analysis of the bullet characteristics that is directly related to the intensity of damage </plain></SENT>
