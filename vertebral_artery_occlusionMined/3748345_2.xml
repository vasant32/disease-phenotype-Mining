<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents our experience with the surgical treatment of 12 of 88 patients with angiographically verified lesions in the vertebral artery who were symptomatic for 1 to 12 months before their evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None experienced symptomatic relief with antiplatelet agents, nor did the administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in 4 of the patients provide any benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions included bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with distal reconstitution through muscular collaterals in 6 patients, unilateral vertebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> with contralateral long-tailed lesions from the vertebral artery origin to C-5 in 3 patients, and severe bilateral vertebral artery origin lesions extending beyond the C-5 level in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A vertebral endarterectomy and vertebral-carotid transposition in the second portion of the artery were successfully used to reestablish flow and obtain symptomatic relief in 10 of the 12 cases; 1 of these procedures had to be redone because of a persistent stenosis at C-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another patient had a saphenous vein graft from the common carotid to the vertebral artery at C-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had an anastomosis of the distal external carotid to the vertebral artery at C-3, but this failed and an anastomosis of the occipital artery to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery had to be completed to reestablish flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
