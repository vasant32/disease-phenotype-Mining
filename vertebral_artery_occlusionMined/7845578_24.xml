<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of flow dynamics in the parent vessel and of intra-aneurysmal coil embolisation on flow pattern and pressure in an in vitro model of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pulsatile perfusion with a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> aqueous solution was installed in a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> model of a lateral giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow visualization and pressure measurements were performed while modifying the flow rate, the pulsatility and the pulse rate in the parent vessel, and after partial coil embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vortices were formed during systole at the downstream lip of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and circulated around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The centre and dome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were areas of fluid stagnation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow rate and pulsatility were the main factors which varied the pattern of flow within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial coil embolisation induced major flow disturbances in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, in particular fluid stagnation at the dome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pressure measurements were similar in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in the parent vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the pulsatility of flow is an important as the flow rate when considering the haemodynamics in a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the clinical context, this could explain the efficacy of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in thrombosing giant vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies with intra-aneurysmal coil embolisation showed early fluid stagnation at the dome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This could result in embolic migration during endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Partial coil embolisation may prevent early rebleeding; however, it may induce additional mural stresses resulting from new haemodynamic forces and compliance mismatch </plain></SENT>
