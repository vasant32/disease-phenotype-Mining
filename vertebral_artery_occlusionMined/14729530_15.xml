<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to assess 3D digital subtraction angiography findings in a patient with a giant vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to simulate and compare the consequences of left and right vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The balloon occlusion test suggested that occlusion of the right vertebral artery is the better way to treat this patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from the point of view of aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and isolation from the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The computer simulation supported this conclusion, at the same time indicating that from the point of view of pressure distribution on the wall of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the right vertebral occlusion may be also accompanied by an undesirable effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high-pressure area on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall in systole was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This high pressure potentially could lead to subsequent aneurysmal growth, which indeed occurred, as was revealed by a follow-up examination 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study is a good example of possible future applications of CFD in patients with cerebrovascular disease before therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
