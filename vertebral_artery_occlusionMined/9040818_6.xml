<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography on the day of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, however, demonstrated complete occlusion of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old hypertensive woman suffered a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> due to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography on the day of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> revealed a complete occlusion of the right vertebral artery just distal to the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of such a case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was still considered to be at significant risk of rerupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Craniotomy and clip occlusion of the right vertebral artery and the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery were carried out to trap the thin-walled sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At discharge, the patient had recovered completely except for some left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limb ataxia</z:hpo>, which subsequently disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two options are available for the treatment of such a case: surgical or medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We employed surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Which is the preferred approach, however, is a difficult judgment to make at this juncture </plain></SENT>
