<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: A disadvantage of transarticular and C2 pedicle screws is vertebral artery (VA) injury as a result of screw misplacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If unilateral occlusion of the VA is present, VA injury of the dominant side will cause fatal complications as a result of collateral flow insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several authors have recently reported the usefulness of C2 laminar screws because of their safety on VA injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used transarticular and C2 laminar screws combined with the atlas hook in a patient with C1-2 instability and unilateral VA occlusion, in order to reduce the risk of further VA injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old woman with rheumatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial subluxation</z:hpo> complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> and neck pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed a left side VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent atlantoaxial, posterior fusion using a transarticular screw on the side of the occlusion and a C2 laminar screw on the dominant side combined with a bilateral atlas hook </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transarticular screw was inserted using a navigation system and image intensifier, and the laminar screw was inserted free hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone grafting from the iliac crest was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transarticular and C2 laminar screws fixation combined with the atlas hook in a patient with unilateral VA occlusion is a useful technique, in order to reduce the risk of further VA injury </plain></SENT>
