<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old man underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) stent replacement of the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiogram revealed bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 50% stenosis in contralateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> by TCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rSO2, BIS and EEG were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33-35 degrees C) was induced by concomitant use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi>, a novel free radical scavenger, and Sendai cocktail were administered before interruption of carotid flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 5 minutes of test occlusion by balloon, right rSO2 decreased from 61% to 49% and EEG showed slow waves with decreased amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore we decided to perform <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and stenting separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right rSO2 decreased from 62% to 48% during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (6 min occlusion), while rSO2 decreased from 66% to 50% during stenting (7.5 min occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EEG also showed the similar changes as observed during test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the procedures, rSO2 and EEG recovered in a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiogram showed an improvement of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and intracranial vessels showed no branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient was maintained hypothermic (35 degrees C) for 2 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He recovered without additional neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found that rSO2 was a useful, real-time and non-invasive method for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in our patient </plain></SENT>
