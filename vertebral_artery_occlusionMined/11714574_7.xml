<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>cervical spondylosis</z:hpo> noticed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> when turning his head to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He underwent subclavian arteriography elsewhere, which showed a block of the contrast medium in the right vertebral artery (VA) at the C5/6 level when the patient turned his head to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After referral to our institute, however, postcontrast CT scan revealed an attenuated shadow of the venous plexus around the right VA at the C3/4 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated selective angiography with rotation of the head after visualization of the entire VA verified the level of obstruction to be at C3/4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resection of the C4 transverse process through an anterior approach with drilling of the C3/4 spondylotic spur of the uncinate processi completely resolved the arterial impingement and the symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When evaluating rotational VA occlusion, dynamic angiography with selective catheterization is essential in determining which level is affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postcontrast CT scan is also useful because it suggests the level even without head rotation </plain></SENT>
