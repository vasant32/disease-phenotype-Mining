<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery damage after cervical fracture and especially cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> is a recognized phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of significant intracranial neurology after unilateral vertebral damage is extremely rare, and to our knowledge, no such injury has been sustained while playing sport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a rare vascular complication of a bifacet C5-C6 dislocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present a 28-year old white man who was a professional rugby player </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He sustained a hyperflexion injury while playing scrum half in a recent league match, which resulted in a C5-C6 dislocation, diagnosed clinically and with a plain radiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient on admission had complete neurologic loss below C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient underwent immediate computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that revealed a 50% displacement of C5 on C6 with a complete unifacet dislocation and the other facet partially dislocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRI revealed signal changes in the cord at the C5-C6 level and an intimal tear in the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decision was taken to reduce the dislocation when medically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A few hours after injury, after an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, the patient sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> owing to the embolization of a clot from the left vertebral artery into the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite rapid embolectomy and subsequent permanent left vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the patient sustained multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the cerebellar, thalamic, occipital, and pontine regions of the brain that eventually proved fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case shows a rare complication of unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite early identification of a basilar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and a successful embolectomy, intracranial infarction occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although there is no guideline for the treatment of vertebral artery damage, early reduction and anticoagulation may reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
