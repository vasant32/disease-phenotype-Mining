<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the selective fibrinolysis no show good results, for this reason the local intra-arterial fibrinolysis appear as the choice treatment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a agiography with basilar artery occlussion or intracranial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This tecnique has been proved to be effective treatment for selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, ophthalmic artery and vertebrobasilar system, reducing the mortality in the vertebrobasilar system from 90% to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We present a 63 years-old man with a vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a probable cardioembolic origen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was treated with r-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> local intra-arterial fibrinolysis, to get a recanalization of vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control TC we see a haemorragic sufusion in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up see a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> and palsy of the low cranial nerves and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> superior cerebral functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The local intra-arterial fibrinolysis is the choise treatment in the vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> because the high morbimortality of this patology and the inefficacy of the others therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The result depend of many factors as the thrombo location, the neurologic state, the evolution time, the start of treatment, the colateral circulation, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue reserve, etc, that have dificult predict the result, but it is best of the natural history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Is necesary, change the concept of emergency and the attitude front the isquemic cerebral disease at the sanitary leaders, the doctors, and the general population, for dispose of more means to cofront this pathology, which permit diminish the morbimortality and reduce the grade of incapacity </plain></SENT>
