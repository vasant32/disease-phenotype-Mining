<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited data about prognosis of such patients in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (including contra-lateral hypoplastic vertebral artery without contribution to the basilar artery system) were identified prospectively from two academic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data including clinical presentation, medical management, angiographic findings, recurrent events and outcome were collected and reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic events in the posterior circulation were identified to have bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One additional patient had a vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a contra-lateral hypoplastic vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the functional evaluation of the blood flow with catheter angiography, the basilar artery was filling from the anterior circulation, with no antegrade flow from bilateral vertebral arteries injection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with anti-platelets (n=4) or started on anti-coagulation after failing anti-platelet therapy (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with new ischemic lesions proven by diffusion weighted images on MRI within 2 to 70 days after the initial event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are at high risk of having early recurrent ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reestablishment of the antegrade vertebro-basilar blood flow through endovascular re-canalization might be an option to decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
