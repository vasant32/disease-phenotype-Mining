<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, different degrees of brain hypoperfusion were induced by one- to four-vessel occlusion, that is, one or both common carotid arteries in combination with or without bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The flow decline was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry, the residual hemodynamic reserve by testing flow reactivity to ventilation with 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> and arteriogenesis by intravascular latex infusion and immunohistochemistry of vascular proliferation and monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimum condition for induction of arteriogenesis was three-vessel (one carotid plus both vertebral arteries) occlusion, which led to reduction of blood flow to about 50% and complete suppression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity, but no histologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week after three-vessel occlusion, the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery significantly enlarged by 39%, and after 3 weeks by 72%, paralleled by the partial return of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity and the appearance of immunohistochemical markers of arteriogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-vessel occlusion is a reliable model for the induction of arteriogenesis in the adult brain and is a new approach for exploring the potentials of arteriogenesis for the prevention of progressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
