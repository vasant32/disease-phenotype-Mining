<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rotational vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> syndrome refers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> as a result of mechanical occlusion or stenosis of the vertebral artery by head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, symptoms are produced on extension or rotation to one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No case of bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hunter's syndrome</z:e> with bilateral presentation at the C4 level has yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man presented with symptomatic bilateral bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hunter's syndrome</z:e> induced by head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of intermittent dizziness, episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo>, nonpulsatile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery insufficiency</z:e> with exacerbation of symptoms on rotation of his head to either side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography angiography showed bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, and dynamic cerebral angiography revealed bilateral rotational vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, with compression of the ipsilateral vertebral artery on head rotation to either side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral surgical decompression at C4-5 with anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion with a plate was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bony obstruction of the vertebral artery on head rotation tends to occur at levels C4 and below, affecting the ipsilateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this rare case, symptomatic bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> occurred as a result of bony compression and was symptomatic on head rotation both to the right and to the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This stenosis was improved with anterior decompression bilaterally, and no further events occurred postoperatively </plain></SENT>
