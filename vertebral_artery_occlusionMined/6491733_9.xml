<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 48 patients, the symptoms occurred as multiple repeated events, five of which resulted in permanent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining seven patients had single events, four of which caused permanent deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had been treated unsuccessfully with antiplatelet agents (37 cases) and with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs (15 cases) before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients had multiple angiographic abnormalities, including bilateral vertebral stenosis in 19 cases, unilateral vertebral stenosis and contralateral occlusion in 18, unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008417'>vertebral hypoplasia</z:hpo> and contralateral stenosis in 10, subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with steal in seven, and bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posterior communicating arteries could not be demonstrated angiographically in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients had associated stenotic or occlusive lesions of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight underwent a vertebral-to-carotid artery transposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 18 had an associated carotid endarterectomy and seven had a vertebral artery endarterectomy immediately before the transposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had saphenous vein grafts, one from the subclavian and one from the common carotid artery to the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other surgical procedures included vertebral artery ligation in one case, transposition of the vertebral artery to the thyrocervical trunk in two cases and to the subclavian artery in one case, and endarterectomy of the origin of the vertebral artery in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two patients had complete resolution of their symptoms: one had persistent dizziness and the other had syncopal episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> (30 cases) which became permanent in four cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> (three cases), elevated hemidiaphragm without respiratory difficulty (two cases), and superficial would <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the presentation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> is generally characteristic, we believe that a specific diagnosis can be established only by angiographic means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">Anticoagulants</z:chebi> have been used to alleviate symptoms in some cases but are ineffective in solving the primary hemodynamic problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgical reconstruction of the affected area deserves further evaluation in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
