<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 10 patients aging from 12 to 52 years old with mean age 41 were performed occlusion of unilateral vertebral artery after 30 minutes test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The whole procedure was under systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Willi's Circle was evaluated by MRA before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No immediate complication occurred after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10 patients were followed up for 3 months to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>8 of the 10 cases accepted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or DSA examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal infarction was found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was filling in contralateral vertebral artery angiography in one patient, but there was no symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is an effective treatment to some complicated posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which is difficult to be clipped and coiled </plain></SENT>
