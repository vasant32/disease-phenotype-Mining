<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: We reviewed retrospectively our experience in treating 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated with interventional reperfusion therapy and the remaining one patient with top of the basilar embolism was treated conservatively because of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and decerebrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> with severely reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 9 patients with reperfusion therapy, 8 patients underwent intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy and the other one patient had direct percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 1 patient treated with direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> had bilateral intracranial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the other patient had left posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> presumably preceding top of the basilar embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 10 patients, residual CBF was evaluated by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomograpy (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization with clinical improvement was achieved in 6 of 9 patients (66.7%) treated with reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with progression or fluctuation of incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndrome</z:e>, SPECT revealed preserved residual CBF and successful recanalization with clinical improvement was achieved by interventional reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in patients with persistent deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and decerebrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, SPECT revealed marked reduction of residual CBF in the brain stem and recanalization could not improve clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative SPECT may be useful to make a decision whether rep er fusion therapy should be performed or not in case of vertebrobasilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
