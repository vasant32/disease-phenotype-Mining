<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) causes long-term formation of new striatal neurons from stem/progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether MCAO leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, changes in vessel density, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ipsilateral SVZ and adjacent striatum, and determined the relation between the migrating neuroblasts and the vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> was studied by injecting Hypoxyprobe-1 during MCAO or 6 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessel density and length was estimated using stereology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New cells were labeled with 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) during weeks 1 and 2 or 7 and 8 after MCAO, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was assessed immunohistochemically with antibodies against BrdU and endothelial cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distance from neuroblasts to nearest vessel was measured using confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ischemic insult caused transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and early, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, but no damage or increase of vascular density in the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> was detected during the first 2 weeks in the dorsomedial striatum adjacent to the SVZ, which also showed long-lasting increase of vascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 2, 6, and 16 weeks after MCAO, the majority of neuroblasts migrated through this area toward the damage, closely associated with blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vasculature plays an important role for long-term striatal neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During several months, neuroblasts migrate close to blood vessels through an area exhibiting early vascular remodeling and persistently increased vessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Optimizing vascularization should be an important strategy to promote neurogenesis and repair after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
