<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, therapies targeting PMN egress have been largely ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this discrepancy we investigated the temporo-spatial localization of PMNs early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in a murine transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using specific markers that distinguish PMN (Ly6G) from monocytes/macrophages (Ly6C) and that define the cellular and basement membrane boundaries of the neurovascular unit (NVU), histology and confocal microscopy revealed that virtually no PMNs entered the infarcted <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regardless of tMCAO duration, PMNs were mainly restricted to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surfaces or perivascular spaces of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular PMN accumulation showed no spatial correlation with increased vessel permeability, enhanced expression of endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, platelet aggregation or release of neutrophil extracellular traps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Live cell imaging studies confirmed that oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation followed by reoxygenation fail to induce PMN migration across a brain endothelial monolayer under flow conditions in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of PMN infiltration in infarcted brain tissues was corroborated in 25 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specimens collected at early time points after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations identify the NVU rather than the brain parenchyma as the site of PMN action after <z:mp ids='MP_0006080'>CNS ischemia</z:mp> and suggest reappraisal of targets for therapies to reduce reperfusion injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
