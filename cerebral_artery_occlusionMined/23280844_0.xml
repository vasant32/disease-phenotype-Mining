<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of CD36 (CD36ko) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury, and oxidative and inflammatory signaling after neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postnatal day 9 CD36ko and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were subjected to a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injury, phagocytosis of dying cells, and CD36 inflammatory signaling were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While the volume of tissue at risk by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging during MCAO was similar in neonatal CD36ko and WT mice, by 24 hours after reperfusion, injury was more severe in CD36ko and was associated with increased caspase-3 cleavage and reduced engulfment of neurons expressing cleaved caspase-3 by activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation was observed in activated microglia in injured WT, whereas increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in vessels and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation induced by MCAO were unaffected by lack of CD36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lyn expression was higher in injured CD36ko, and cell type-specific patterns of Lyn expression were altered; Lyn was expressed in endothelial cells and microglia in WT but predominantly in dying neurons in CD36ko </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Lack of CD36 results in poorer short-term outcome from neonatal focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to lack of attenuation of NF-κB-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and diminished removal of apoptotic neuronal debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although inhibition of CD36 does not seem to be a good therapeutic target for protection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as it is after adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, seeking better understanding of CD36 signaling in particular cell populations may reveal important therapeutic targets for neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
