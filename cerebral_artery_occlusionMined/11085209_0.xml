<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the work was to describe the relationship between glial and pial cells in a condition of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and the eventual involvement of these cells in removal of debris and reconstruction of the glial-limiting lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in rats in which the right middle cerebral artery was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of a lesion and its extension was controlled in vivo 24 h after the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed 10 or 15 days after the occlusion and their brain was processed for transmission and scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural examination of the lesion revealed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> parenchyma was replaced by cicatricial tissue composed by glial and pial areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pial areas were composed mainly by leaf-like cells forming a network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their main cytoplasmic feature was the presence of large lysosomes in which ferritine-like particles were often enclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The glial areas were composed by strictly packed cells which displayed at scanning electron microscopy a spider-like shape with a central body and elongated cell processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for the glio-pial system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the pial cells seem to be directly involved in removal of cell debris while glial cells seem mainly devoted to the reconstruction of the glial limiting lamina </plain></SENT>
