<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen adult Wistar rats with MCAO reperfusion and ten pseudooperation rats were performed MRS in vivo at the sixth weeks, then pathologic examination of HE staining and immunohistochemical staining were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared hippocampus modality, cell density and immunohistochemical results with N-acetylaspartate, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> changes and ration of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The values of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>, Cr and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr of ipsilateral hippocampus lesion in MCAO reperfusion rats (2.05 +/- 0.33, 2.42 +/- 0.41 and 0.86 +/- 0.10) were visiblly decreased than contralateral hippocampus (3.45 +/- 0.58, 3.10 +/- 0.93, 1.18 +/- 0.32) and control group (3.42 +/- 0.43, 3.57 +/- 0.47, 0.98 +/- 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But the level of decreased <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> is not corresponding to the degree of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in ipsilateral region of hippocampus in histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRS has perfect explanation of cell metabolic changes in CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decrease of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> represented neuron delayed injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But the decreased level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> is not perfectly corresponded to the degree of neuron lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This change has closed correlation with reactive astrocytes proliferation </plain></SENT>
