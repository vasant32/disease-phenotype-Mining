<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of notoginsenoside-Rg, on expression of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi>) in cerebrum cortex after MCAO/R (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reperfusion) injury in rat by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 36 SD male rats were randomly divided into MCAO/R model group, notogisenoside-Rg1 therapy group (100 mg/kg) and the positive medicine control group (nimodipine 1 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MCAO/R model were made by thread-occluded method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four rats were randomly taken from each groups and were killed to be breaken out brain tissues as specimens after which were treated with medicine in 1,3, 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from cerebrum cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific oligonucleotide primers of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> gene fragments were amplificated by RT-PCR to construct recombinant plasmid and sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To dilute recombinant plasmid didploidly and a quantitative standard curve was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taqman fluorogenic quantitative RT-PCR (FQ-PCR) was set up to detect the BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variety of cerebrum cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group and the postive control group, notogisenoside-Rg1 treated groups could obviously improve some <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> deficit symptoms in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and increase BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> amount that in the cerebrum cortex at different period after rat MCAO/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Notoginsenoside-Rg1 can promote to generating internal BDNF protein in brain by up-regulation the expression of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> amount in the cerebrum cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BDNF bind in TrkB, which can give rise to protective effects for ischemic neurons by generating corresponding domino effect molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accordingly it can be as a therapy method in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
