<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated platelet deposition in selected parts of the cat brain after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten anesthesized cats were given autologous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111-labeled platelets and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi>-labeled erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was occluded with miniature <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clips for 3 hours via a transorbital approach; blood pressure was reduced concomitantly to decrease the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of the clips initiated a 45-minute period of normotensive reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice, the brain was removed and sectioned for comparison of right- versus left-hemisphere platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelets were selectively deposited in the territory of the occluded right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant deposition was found in the caudate nucleus, internal capsule, parietal cortex, and the centrum semiovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the evidence that platelets are deposited in the microvasculature during temporary severe focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
