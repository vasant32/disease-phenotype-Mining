<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experiment evaluated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurologic function in rats subjected to temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> while anesthetized with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome in these animals was compared to that observed in rats maintained unanesthetized during a similar ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and surgically prepared for filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After preparation, one group (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>) remained anesthetized with approximately 1.4 MAC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another group (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> was discontinued and substituted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>, which was administered until electroencephalographic burst suppression was evident (approximately 1.4 MAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final group (Awake) was allowed to awaken immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> persisted for 90 min in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery filament then was removed, and a 96-h survival interval was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that transient mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> occurs in awake rats undergoing filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To examine the potential role of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in this experiment, a second experiment was performed in which rats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> underwent 90-min focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with pericranial temperatures held at either 38.0 degrees C or 39.2 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraischemic mean arterial pressure was 20-25 mmHg lower in the two anesthetized groups compared with awake animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite this finding, cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (mean +/- SD; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>, 17 +/- 32 mm3; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi>, 36 +/- 57 mm3; Awake, 115 +/- 104 mm3; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi>, 36 +/- 57 mm3; Awake, 115 +/- 104 mm3) and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (mean +/- SD; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>, 39 +/- 57 mm3; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi>, 50 +/- 29 mm3; Awake, 88 +/- 46 mm3) were reduced in both groups of anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This reduction correlated with improved neurologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The rats in whom the pericranial temperature was maintained at 39.2 degrees C had a larger total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (218 +/- 81 mm3) and increased neurologic deficits when compared to those in whom the pericranial temperature was maintained at 38.0 degrees C (total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, 75 +/- 77 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> substantially reduced damage in this focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model when compared to outcome resulting from the same insult induced in awake rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The reduction in intraischemic mean arterial pressure caused by the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> did not seem contributory to outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Brain temperature differences among the groups were not defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Because small differences in pericranial temperature were shown to have major effects on outcome, further work is required to determine if differences in brain temperature explain the observed protective effects of these <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
