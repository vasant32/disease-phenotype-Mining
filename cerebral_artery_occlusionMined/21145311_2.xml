<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the expression and functionality of CB(1) receptors in coronal brain slices obtained from ovariectomised female rats 46days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated with either 17ß-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> or placebo pellets 6h after MCAO and thereafter housed either in isolated or enriched environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[(3)H]CP55,940 autoradiography indicated no significant effect of 17ß-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> treatment or housing environment upon CB(1) receptor densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a modest but significant decrease in the CB(1) receptor density on the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CB(1) receptor functionality was assessed by measurement of basal and CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>γS autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, a robust stimulation, blocked by the CB(1) receptor inverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> AM251, was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in the response to CP55,940 with respect either to the 17ß-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> treatment, housing environment or MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that although there are modest long-term decreases in ipsilateral CB(1) receptor densities following MCAO in female rats, these decreases do not result in a functional CB(1) receptor deficit </plain></SENT>
