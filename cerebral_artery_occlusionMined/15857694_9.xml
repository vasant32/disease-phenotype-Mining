<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is known to play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the rat, however, the available data on the cellular synthesis of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in the mouse are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the time profile, the topography and the quantitative, cellular expression of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in mice subjected to permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in situ hybridization analysis showed that IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed during the first post-surgical hour in a small number of high-expressing macrophage-like cells, located in cortical layers I and II of the future <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 h, a significant number of faintly labeled IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing cells had appeared in the developing peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and the number remained constant at 4 h and 6 h, when the hybridization signal began to distribute to the cellular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR performed on whole hemispheres showed a significant 20-fold increase in the relative level of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 12 h and a highly significant 42-fold increase at 24 h, at which time single IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing cells were supplemented by aggregates and perivascular infiltrates of intensely labeled IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and double immunohistochemical stainings in addition to combined in situ hybridization, confirmed that the intensely labeled IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing and IL-1beta protein synthesizing cells predominantly were glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunonegative, macrophage associated antigen-1-immunopositive microglia-macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By day 5 there was a dramatic decline in the relative level of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the data provide evidence that permanent occlusion of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in mice results in expression of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and IL-1beta synthesis in spatially and temporally segregated subpopulations of microglia and macrophages </plain></SENT>
