<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND and PURPOSE: We have recently shown high-dose human serum albumin therapy to confer marked histological protection in experimental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in conjunction with morphological methods to expand our understanding of this therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physiologically controlled Sprague-Dawley rats received 2-hour MCAo by the modified intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated rats received 25% human serum albumin solution (1% by body weight) immediately after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was reopened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-treated rats received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer-based image averaging was used to analyze DWI data obtained 24 hours after MCAo and light-microscopic histopathology obtained at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a matched series, plasma osmolality and colloid oncotic pressure, as well as brain water content, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Albumin therapy, which lowered the hematocrit on average by 37% and raised plasma colloid oncotic pressure by 56%, improved the neurological score throughout the 3-day survival period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the ischemic focus, the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) computed from DWI data declined by 40% in vehicle-treated rats but was preserved at near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (8% decline) in albumin-treated rats (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Albumin also led to higher <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values within unlesioned brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed large consistent cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in vehicle-treated rats, while albumin therapy reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at these sites, on average, by 84% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by 66% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> was virtually eliminated by albumin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, while infarcted regions of vehicle-treated rats had the typical changes of pannecrosis, infarcted zones of albumin-treated brains showed persistence of vascular endothelium and prominent microglial activation, suggesting that albumin therapy may help to preserve the neuropil within zones of residual infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the striking neuroprotective efficacy of albumin therapy in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reveal that this effect is associated with DWI normalization and a mitigation of pannecrotic changes within zones of residual injury </plain></SENT>
