<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether tPA, administered by intranasal delivery directly targeting the brain and spinal cord, provides therapeutic benefit during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated intranasally with saline, 60 μg or 600 μg recombinant human tPA at 7 and 14days after MCAo (n=8/group), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adhesive-removal test and a foot-fault test were used to monitor functional recovery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Naive rats (n=6) were employed as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized 8 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with saline treated animals, significant functional improvements were evident in rats treated with 600 μg tPA (p&lt;0.05), but not in 60 μg tPA treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 600 μg tPA treatment significantly enhanced both CRT and CST sprouting originating from the contralesional cortex into the denervated side of the red nucleus and cervical gray matter compared with control group (p&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The behavioral outcomes were highly correlated with CRT and CST axonal remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that delayed tPA intranasal treatment provides therapeutic benefits for neurological recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by, at least in part, promoting neuronal remodeling in the brain and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
