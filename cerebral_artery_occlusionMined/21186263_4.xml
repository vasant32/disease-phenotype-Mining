<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, plasticity-promoting effects have been described for the growth factor erythropoietin in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate erythropoietin's effects in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic brain, we examined how this growth factor influences functional neurological recovery, perilesional tissue remodelling and axonal sprouting of the corticorubral and corticobulbar tracts, when administered intra-cerebroventricularly starting 3 days after 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin administered at 10 IU/day (but not at 1 IU/day), <z:mp ids='MP_0010052'>increased grip strength</z:mp> of the contralesional paretic forelimb and improved motor coordination without influencing spontaneous locomotor activity and exploration behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological recovery by erythropoietin was associated with structural remodelling of ischaemic brain tissue, reflected by enhanced neuronal survival, <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> and decreased reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> that resulted in reduced scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhanced axonal sprouting from the ipsilesional pyramidal tract into the brainstem was observed in vehicle-treated ischaemic compared with non-ischaemic animals, as shown by injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> into both motor cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite successful remodelling of the perilesional tissue, erythropoietin enhanced axonal sprouting of the contralesional, but not ipsilesional pyramidal tract at the level of the red and facial nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, molecular biological and histochemical studies revealed broad anti-inflammatory effects of erythropoietin in both hemispheres together with expression changes of plasticity-related molecules that facilitated contralesional axonal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study establishes a plasticity-promoting effect of erythropoietin after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, indicating that erythropoietin acts via recruitment of contralesional rather than of ipsilesional pyramidal tract projections </plain></SENT>
