<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of emergency thrombolysis as a treatment strategy for thromboembolic intracerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients with symptoms suggestive of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients were treated with intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was determined by comparing the admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score to the 24-hour National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cost and length of stay of both populations were derived and used as measures of direct cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of admission to extended care facilities and estimated length cost of admission was used as a measure of indirect cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The control population became slightly worse, with a change in National Institutes of Health score of -0.5, whereas the treated population improved slightly, with a change in National Institutes of Health score of +5.12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the direct costs data between the two populations revealed a slight increased mean for the treated population ($15,202) as compared with the control population ($13,478) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unpaired t test, however, revealed no significant cost difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By reducing the number of completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by one third or by decreasing the severity by the same factor (as shown in our study), the likelihood of admission to an extended nursing facility also is decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cost saving per patient from extended care facilities is approximately $3435 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The emergency application of intraarterial thrombolysis with urokinase results in a statistically significant positive change in National Institutes of Health score by at least five points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant benefit is realized through the use of intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A statistically insignificant additional cost is shown by this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This insignificant cost is more than offset by the saved nursing home costs </plain></SENT>
