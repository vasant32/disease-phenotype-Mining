<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When applied for 48 to 72 hours, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> seems to reduce the mortality rate of MaCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, even after 72 hours, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> is still present, and the patient's condition often worsens during rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here report, as a case series, our experience with the use of prolonged moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to treat patients with MaCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve MaCI patients 27 to 64 years of age were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> presented with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cooling blanket was used to lower the patient's core temperature to 32 degrees C to 33 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced within 24 hours of infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and was discontinued when the CT scan showed a subsiding mass effect and was followed by slow rewarming (2-5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were mechanically ventilated while sedated with high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724">gamma-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi>, a naturally occurring metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>), which acts on the GABAB receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients survived for 6 months, and 6 were able to walk without assistance; the other 5 died due to early cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (2) or progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for the survivors was 19 days (range, 11-22 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Side effects observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724">gamma-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> can be used to treat MaCI patients, with a fairly good clinical outcome for survivors </plain></SENT>
