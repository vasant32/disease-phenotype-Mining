<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to examine the neuroprotective effects and pharmacokinetics of the noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor channel blocker (S)-alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38193">phenylpyridine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15862">ethanamine</z:chebi> dihydrochloride, AR-R15896AR (formerly designated ARL 15896AR), using a gyrencephalic cat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a separate experiment, three cats were used for pharmacokinetic analysis, thus establishing the optimal dose of AR-R15896AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in 21 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of a 90-min ischemic insult, the cats received an intravenous infusion (total volume, 3 ml), in a 15-minute period, of either AR-R15896AR or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline solution (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological data were obtained after 40 and 80 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, each cat was positioned for both T2- and diffusion-weighted scans (eight slices, 5-mm thick) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 8 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals were perfusion-fixed for histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that AR-R15896AR remained in the blood at elevated levels for the 6 hours studied, with a calculated half-life of approximately 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AR-R15896AR rapidly entered the brain and exhibited a brain/plasma ratio of approximately 8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The infarction volumes for the AR-R15896AR-treated group were 1138.5+/-363.1, 651.3+/-428.9, and 118.6+/-50.1 mm3, as calculated using diffusion- and T2-weighted MRI and histopathological data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The infarction volumes for the control group were 3866.3+/-921, 3536+/-995.7, and 359.9+/-80.2 mm3, as calculated using diffusion- and T2-weighted MRI and histopathological data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in the physiological parameters measured (mean arterial blood pressure, pH, arterial carbon dioxide pressure, arterial oxygen pressure, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, hematocrit, and temperature) for either the control or AR-R15896AR-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postischemic calcium levels returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the AR-R15896AR-treated cats, whereas they decreased in the control cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When administered after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, AR-R15896AR was effective in significantly reducing infarction volumes, as measured using diffusion- or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data or quantitative histopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study also demonstrated that infarction volumes were greater in the diffusion- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans than in the qualitative histopathological analyses, with the diffusion-weighted scans exibiting the largest infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
