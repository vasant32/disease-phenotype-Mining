<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that MCAO increased LRP expression primarily in astrocytes and that this effect was significantly decreased in the absence of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the ischemic insult induced activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and plasminogen (Plg(-/-))-deficient mice, and this effect was attenuated after inhibition of LRP or genetic deficiency of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, administration of tPA to tPA(-/-) mice resulted in activation of the NF-kappaB pathway comparable with that observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Plg(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report that inhibition of either tPA activity or LRP or genetic deficiency of tPA resulted in a significant decrease in MCAO-induced nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production and inducible nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that after MCAO the interaction between tPA and LRP results in NF-kappaB activation in astrocytes and induction of inducible nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression in the ischemic tissue, suggesting a cytokine-like plasminogen-independent role for tPA during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
