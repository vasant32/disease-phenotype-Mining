<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ensuring the translatability of primate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models is critical for preclinical testing of cerebroprotective strategies, and such models would benefit from further characterization of the experimental ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to examine the cerebral metabolic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in baboons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy and to correlate metabolite levels with functional neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven baboons underwent 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 and 10 days, each animal was imaged with traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and multivoxel proton (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, and a neurologic examination was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectra obtained from the infarcted hemisphere of each animal were compared with the contralateral hemisphere, and metabolite levels were correlated with neurologic outcome scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spectra obtained at 3 days postischemia revealed prominent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (LAC) resonances and attenuated N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) peaks in infarcted hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten-day spectra showed persistence of these findings in animals with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (&gt;30% of the hemisphere), with partial normalization of the spectra in animals with small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (&lt;30% of the hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean area under the curve from LAC spectra had a negative correlation with functional outcome by 2 different scoring systems (r(2) = 0.72 and 0.73), whereas <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> showed a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.79 and 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic alterations observed in our primate model of reperfused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy recapitulate those seen in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, correlations between LAC and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> peaks with functional outcome further suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy may play a role in outcome prediction following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in higher primates </plain></SENT>
