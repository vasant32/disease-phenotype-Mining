<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in the intracellular calcium, [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i, plays a major role in neuronal injury during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a large amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ enters neurons through the VSCC during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, inconsistent neuroprotective effects have been reported with the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the VSCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An intraperitoneal injection of nicardipine (1.2 mg/kg) was administered to rats 10 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and 8, 16, and 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical CBF was determined by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological and neuropathological examinations were performed after 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuron-specific enolase, a specific marker for the incidence of neuronal injury, was measured in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF and other physiological parameters were not affected by nicardipine during occlusion or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, nicardipine treatment significantly improved motor neurological outcome by 29%, and the infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume in the pallium as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume in the striatum were significantly reduced by 27%, 37%, and 52%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine also reduced the neuron-specific enolase plasma levels by 50%, 42%, and 59% at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that nicardipine may attenuate focal ischemic brain injury by exerting direct neuroprotective and antiedematous effects that do not depend on CBF </plain></SENT>
