<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Notch signaling activity regulates arteriogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presenilin 1 (PS1) mediates Notch signaling activity via cleavage of Notch, liberating Notch intracellular domain (NICD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> enhances arteriogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by increasing PS1 activation of the Notch signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) starting 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and daily for 7 days; they were euthanized 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining, Western blot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased arterial diameter, density, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and upregulated PS1, Notch1, and NICD expression in the ischemic border tissue and in the cerebral arteries compared with MCAo control rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> did not increase arteriogenesis, PS1, and NICD expression in sham control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced arteriogenesis, primary cerebral artery cultures were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to MCAo and treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral arteries derived from these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats were cultured in matrigel and treated with or without a gamma40-secretase inhibitor II, which blocks Notch signaling activity, inhibiting NICD production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arterial cell migration was measured. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased arterial cell migration compared to control MCAo artery, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling activity by the gamma40-secretase inhibitor II significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced arterial cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> increases arteriogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> upregulation of PS1 expression and Notch signaling activity may facilitate an increase in arteriogenesis </plain></SENT>
