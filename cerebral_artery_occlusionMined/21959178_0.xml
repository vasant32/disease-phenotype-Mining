<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h followed by 22h of reperfusion model was used in male Wistar rats to study the protection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">Hesperidin</z:chebi> administration (50mg/kg b.wt.) once daily for 15days has improved the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, reduced the neurological deficits in terms of behaviors, and protected the elevated level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive species (TBARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly depleted activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) in MCAO group were protected significantly in MCAO group pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> like TNF-α, IL-1β levels, expression of iNOS and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were significantly attenuated in H+MCAO group as compared to MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> ameliorated the functional and histological outcomes with elevated endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> status as well as reduced induction of proinflammatory cytokines in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We theorized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> is among the pharmacological agents that reduce free radicals and its associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and have been found to limit the extent of brain damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
