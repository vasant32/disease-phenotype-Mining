<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> protects neuronal cells from damage by enhancing Akt activation, thus mediating antiapoptosis signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information regarding the effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> on the activation of genes further downstream in the Akt signaling pathway in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> modulates the antiapoptotic signal through Akt and its downstream targets, Bad and 14-3-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected at 24 hr after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the positive reaction of TUNEL staining in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signal pathway activation was measured by phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) and Bad at Ser(136) using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decrease of pAkt and pBad levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> did not affect the expression of 14-3-3, which acts as an antiapoptotic factor through interaction with Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction between pBad and 14-3-3 increased in the presence of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, compared to that of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> because of brain injury and that these protective effects are mediated through maintaining the interaction between pBad and 14-3-3, thus blocking activation of the apoptotic pathway </plain></SENT>
