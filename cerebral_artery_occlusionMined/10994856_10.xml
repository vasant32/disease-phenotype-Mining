<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better characterize the hemodynamic signature of infarction. the authors have assessed the severity and temporal evolution of ischemic hemodynamics in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and total and microvascular cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes were measured with arterial spin labeling and steady-state susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively, and analyzed in regions corresponding to infarcted and spared ipsilateral tissue, based on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> histology sections after 24 hours <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spin echo susceptibility contrast was used to measure microvascular-weighted CBV, which had a maximum sensitivity for vessels with radii between 4 and 30 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements between 1 and 3 hours after occlusion showed no change in CBF (22 +/- 20% of contralateral, mean +/- SD) or in total CBV (78 +/- 13% of contralateral) in regions destined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, microvascular CBV progressively declined from 72 +/- 5% to 64 +/- 11% (P &lt; 0.01) during this same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microvascular CBV changes with time were entirely due to decreases in subcortical infarcted zones (from 73 +/- 9% to 57 +/- 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P &lt; 0.001) without changes in the cortical infarcted territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic variables showed differences in magnitude and temporal response, and these changes varied based on histologic outcome and brain architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such factors should be considered when designing imaging studies for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
