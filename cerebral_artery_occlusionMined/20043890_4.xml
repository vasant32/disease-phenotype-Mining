<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are capable of providing continuous neurotrophic factor and of promoting growth and remyelination of damaged axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated OECs for the repair of white matter after transplantation in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OECs were cultured from the olfactory bulbs of adult green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic rats and transplanted into peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> basal ganglia imminently after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality, neurological score, and function were record everyday until 56 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h and 56 days, the infarction volume, the Luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining, and Neurofilament (NF) immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and remyelination in white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OECs transplantation reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, decreased mortality, and improved neurological deficits in 56 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LFB marked myelin, NF-positive immunohistochemistry, and Western blot indicated that the remyelination and axon regeneration in OEC transplanted rat were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, OECs can protect the white matter from ischemic injury, but the potential mechanisms of transplanted OEC-mediated recovery need further studies to identify </plain></SENT>
