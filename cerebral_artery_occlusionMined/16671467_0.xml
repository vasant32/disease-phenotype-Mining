<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous results from our laboratory have shown that neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was characterized by increased substance P (SP) immunoreactivity and could be attenuated with administration of SP <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> with a resultant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined whether neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, as identified by increased SP immunoreactivity, occurs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its potential role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examines SP immunoreactivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anaesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats using a reversible thread model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased SP immunoreactivity at 24 hours relative to the non-infarcted hemisphere was observed in perivascular, neuronal, and glial tissue, and within the penumbra of the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was not as apparent in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increased SP immunoreactivity was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, as reflected by increased SP immunoreactivity, occurs following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and that this may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, inhibition of neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following reversible, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
