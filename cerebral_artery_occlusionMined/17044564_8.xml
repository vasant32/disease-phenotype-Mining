<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Postischemic cerebral inflammatory injury has been extensively investigated in an effort to develop effective neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complement cascade has emerged as an important contributor to postischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble complement receptor Type 1 (sCR1), a potent inhibitor of complement activation, has been shown to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve functional outcome after murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given numerous high-profile failures to translate promising antiinflammatory strategies from the laboratory to the clinic and given the known species-specificity of the complement cascade, the authors sought to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of sCR1 in a nonhuman primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 48 adult male baboons (Papio anubis) were randomly assigned to receive 15 mg/kg of sCR1 or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were subjected to 75 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative blood samples were analyzed for total complement activity by using a CH50 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological scores were assessed at the time the animals were killed, and immunohistochemistry was used to determine cerebral drug penetration and C1q deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An interim futility analysis led to termination of the trial after study of 12 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total serum complement activity was significantly depressed in the sCR1-treated animals compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining also demonstrated sCR1 deposition in the ischemic hemispheres of treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite these findings, there were no significant differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or neurological score between the sCR1--and vehicle-treated cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A preischemic bolus infusion of sCR1, the most effective means of administration in mice, was not neuroprotective in a primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates the utility of a translational primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the assessment of promising antiischemic agents prior to implementation of large-scale clinical trials </plain></SENT>
