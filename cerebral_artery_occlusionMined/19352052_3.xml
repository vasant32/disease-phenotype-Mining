<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of prostate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> response-4 (Par-4), a proapoptotic gene the expression of which is increased after ischemic injury, in ghrelin-mediated neuroprotection during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin protected cortical neurons from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin receptor specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> abolished the protective effects of ghrelin, whereas those of des-acyl ghrelin were preserved, suggesting the involvement of a receptor that is distinct from GHS-R1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of Par-4 was increased by MCAO, which was attenuated by ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, prevented <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release, and inhibited caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
