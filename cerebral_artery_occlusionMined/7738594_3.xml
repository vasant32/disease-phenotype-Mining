<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of carotid Duplex ultrasound study from 164 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity and diameter were measured in bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end-diastolic flow velocity (Ved) and the pulsatility index (PI) were calculated from Doppler waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PI is an index of peripheral vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the relationship between percent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and percent decrease in Ved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients studied could be classified into three groups using ultrasound parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group I was characterized by &gt; 30% decrease in Ved and &lt; 80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, group II by &lt; 30% decrease in Ved and &lt; 80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and group III by &gt; 30% decrease in Ved and &gt; 80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 23 patients in group I had embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stem occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>28 out of 115 patients in group II had thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stem occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 26 patients in group III had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ved was markedly reduced in group I and group III compared to group II (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PI in the affected artery was increased in groups I and III (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Embolic occlusion was characterized by &gt; 30% decrease in Ved in the absence of &gt; 80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and an increase in PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that these two conditions can be differentiated using Duplex ultrasound in carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
