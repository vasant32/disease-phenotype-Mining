<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculated that anti-oxidative property of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> is implicated, and investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>' influences on the oxidative neuronal damage in the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 14 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, pitavastatin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, or vehicle administration, 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was imposed on Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> (HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), both of which are <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, as well as infarction formation were investigated at 1 day after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle group, massive infarction was confirmed and HNE and 8-OHdG are robustly produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>-treated group, the infarction was smaller and the HNE and 8-OHdG production was less prominent than the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> investigated, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was most effective for reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and infarction volume, which may be brought by its highly lipophilic property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may be one main reason in ameliorating ischemic brain damage in rats </plain></SENT>
