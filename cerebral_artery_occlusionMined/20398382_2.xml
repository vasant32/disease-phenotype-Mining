<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by intraluminal suture placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were randomized to 4 groups: MCAO for 0.5 hours followed by saline treatment (10 ml/kg; group 1); MCAO for 3 hours followed by treatment with saline (group 2) or urokinase (25000 IU/kg; group 3); and MCAO for 6 hours followed by urokinase treatment (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative maximum slope of increase of the signal intensity time curve (rMSI) were quantitatively analyzed from MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microvessel diameter and blood-brain barrier disruption obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were obtained for correlative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Benign hyperemia was noticed only in group 1; malignant hyperemia was seen in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the rCBV of malignant hyperemia was slightly higher than in benign hyperemia (P &gt; 0.05), the rMSI, on the other hand, was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-isothiocyanate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>) extravasations, marked glial end-foot process swelling, and significant vasodilatation were seen in malignant hyperemia, while no or mild leakage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and slight glial end-foot process swelling occurred in benign hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that DCE pMRI can characterize post-ischemic hyperemia and correlates well with microvascular damage </plain></SENT>
