<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the temporal distribution of the p53-immunoreactive protein in conjunction with cellular damage and the expression of the p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 66; controls, n = 7) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were killed at various times of reperfusion (0.5 to 168 hours) for p53 immunohistochemistry and Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cellular expression of mutant p53-immunoreactive protein was found localized to anatomic sites exhibiting severe neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A maximal induction of mutant p53-immunoreactive protein was found at 12 hours after reperfusion and subsequently declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 protein expression was detected after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time-dependent expression of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peak level of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> occurred at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the expressions of p53-immunoreactive protein and p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are upregulated after transient focal cerebral ischemic insult in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concomitant appearance of p53 and cell damage in ischemic brain suggests that p53 expression may impact cell biological response to an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
