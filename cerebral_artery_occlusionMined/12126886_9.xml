<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SM-20220 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection immediately after occlusion, followed by a continuous infusion over 2.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 72 h after occlusion, the infract area was measured using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining and, using the same slices, neutrophils in the brain were immuno-stained with anti-myeloperoxidase (n=11) </plain></SENT>
