<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the promise of a therapy is commonly judged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measurements, assuming that a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size results in reduction of the functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the validity of the concept that structural integrity translates into functional integrity during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> period (24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in Fischer F344 rats leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> comprising the ipsilateral striatum and cortical structures, including the somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods (T(2), diffusion, perfusion MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional integrity of the somatosensory cortex was assessed by functional MRI (fMRI) measuring changes in local cerebral blood volume, and by assessing the forelimb grip strength and the beam-walking performance of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> isradipine (2.5 mg/kg injected s.c. immediately after pMCAO) reduced the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by more than 40% compared to vehicle-injected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in diffusion- and T(2)-weighted MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats simultaneous electrical stimulation of both forepaws led to similar activation of both somatosensory cortices, while in pMCAO animals given vehicle only the contralateral cortex showed an fMRI response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in pMCAO rats treated with isradipine, functional activation following bilateral electrical stimulation was only detected in the contralateral somatosensory cortex despite the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance of the ipsilateral cortex in MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fMRI responses to pharmacological stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3092">bicuculline</z:chebi> were virtually absent in the ipsilateral somatosensory cortices both in vehicle- and isradipine-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally there was no significant difference between vehicle- and isradipine-treated animals upon the performance of beam-walking test or in forelimb grip strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (24 h) post-occlusion period, structural integrity in the somatosensory cortex revealed by MRI does not translate into preservation of function </plain></SENT>
