<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous (i.v.) administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> (3, 15 and 30 mg/kg), an endothelin <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat did not significantly alter cortical perfusion in these rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 62 +/- 3% reduction in laser doppler flow was observed 10 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the vehicle-treated group compared to a 49 +/- 5% reduction in laser doppler flow in the group receiving 15 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat also failed to elicit significant alterations in the reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (frontal cortex; 81 +/- 13 ml/100 g/min) and subsequent hemispheric volume of ischemic damage observed (94 +/- 9 mm3) compared to the vehicle treated animals (68 +/- 9 ml/100 g/min, 113 +/- 5 mm3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minimal changes were also observed in these endpoints, when a 15 mg/kg dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> was administered following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> failed to expose a major role for endothelins in focal ischemic pathology in the rat </plain></SENT>
