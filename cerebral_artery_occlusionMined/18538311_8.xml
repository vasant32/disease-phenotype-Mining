<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the possibility that intracerebroventricular (ICV, lateral ventricle) infusion of exogenous Ang-(1-7) could participate in the potentiation of bradykinin (BK) release and the kinin receptor expression in ischemic brain parenchyma after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and sham-operated models were prepared, continuously administrated with Ang-(1-7) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) by implanted Alzet osmotic minipumps into lateral cerebral ventricle after reperfusion in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental animals were divided into sham-operated group (sham+aCSF), aCSF treatment group (MCAO+aCSF) and Ang-(1-7) treatment groups [MCAO+Ang-(1-7)] at low (1 pmol/0.5 microl/h), medium (100 pmol/0.5 microl/h) or high (10 nmol/0.5 microl/h) dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> resulted in a significant increase of BK formation from 3 h to 6 h compared with sham-operated group after reperfusion, whereas medium- and high-dose Ang-(1-7) infusion markedly enhanced BK levels from 6 h to 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medium- and high-dose Ang-(1-7) infusion markedly increased kinin B(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, whereas only high-dose Ang-(1-7) infusion induced upregulating the expression of B(1) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-dose Ang-(1-7) infusion did not modify both the kinin B(1) and B(2) receptor expression compared with aCSF treatment group after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding might indicate complex interactions between Ang-(1-7) and kallikrein-kinin system in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
