<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>96 rats were randomly divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used for the research of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this animal model, the effects of Calpeptin on the neurological functions, infarction volume and infarction volume percentage of brain, Caspase-3 expression and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hippocampal CA1 sector after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in rats were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current results confirmed that Calpeptin as the Calpain inhibitor might paly an important role for neuroprotection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calpeptin could reduce the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hippocampal CA1 sector when the rats was subjected to the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion, the potential mechanism might be related to the inhibition of the expression of Caspase-3 by Calpeptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unknown to what the exact mechanism of Calpeptin inhibits the activation of Caspase-3 in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further research needs to be done to unravel the underlying mechanisms in the future </plain></SENT>
