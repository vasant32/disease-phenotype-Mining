<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of acid-base management during pre- and intra-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume using a transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> temperature was maintained in a group of 7 anesthetized rats, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30 degrees C) was maintained in two other groups of 7 anesthetized rats, in which alpha-stat (PaCO2 measured at 37 degrees C was maintained at 36 mmHg) and pH-stat (PaCO2 corrected for body temperature was maintained at 36 mmHg) conditions, respectively, were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded for 2 h and then reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured after 24 h and expressed as a percentage of hemisphere volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> reduced rCBF in the alpha-stat group and the pH-stat group to 52 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 7%, respectively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, rCBF dropped in the control group, alpha-stat group, and pH-stat group to 57 +/- 11%, 31 +/- 9%, 27 +/- 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in the alpha-stat group, and pH-stat group was significantly smaller (10 +/- 1% and 7 +/- 2%) than in the control group (42 +/- 7%, p &lt; 0.01), but no differences were found between the hypothermic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in acid-base management in the present study did not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, but pre-ischemic rCBF in the alpha-stat group was significantly lower than in the pH-stat group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The steeper fall in rCBF after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the pH-stat group suggested that the autoregulatory response of the collateral pathways may have been reduced in this group </plain></SENT>
