<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the drastic changes of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> have been reported to be useful indicators of the ischemic damage in both humans and experimental animals, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signals are also detected by the short echo time sequence 1-5 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to find a novel technique to isolate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> signals from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signals in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, MRS was used to study the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> components of a spherical phantom in vitro, and parameters were established to separate these components in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements were obtained from the brains of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements were performed using a 7-T (300 MHz), 18.3-cm-bore superconducting magnet (Oxford Magnet Technologies) interfaced to a Unity INOVA Imaging System (Varian Technologies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted images were obtained from a 1.0-mm-thick coronal section using a 3-cm field of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is well known that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> has a shorter and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> a longer T2 relaxation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These distinct magnetic characteristics allowed us to separate the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> signal from the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, adjustment of the echo time is essential to analyze the metabolites in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, which may be useful in both the clinic and laboratory </plain></SENT>
