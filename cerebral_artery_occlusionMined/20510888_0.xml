<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Drugs that increase central noradrenergic activity have been shown to enhance the rate of recovery of motor function in pre-clinical models of brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known about whether noradrenergic agents can improve the extent of motor recovery and whether such improvement can be sustained over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine if increasing central noradrenergic tone using atipamezole, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, could induce a long-term improvement in motor performance in rats subjected to ischemic brain damage caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of pairing physical "rehabilitation" with enhanced noradrenergic activity was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atipamezole (1 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (<z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> saline) was administered once daily on Days 2-8 post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half of each drug group was housed under enriched environment conditions supplemented with daily focused activity sessions while the other half received standard housing with no focused activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skilled motor performance in forelimb reaching and ladder rung walking was assessed for 8 weeks post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving atipamezole plus rehabilitation exhibited significantly greater motor improvement in both behavioral tests as compared to vehicle-treated animals receiving rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, animals receiving atipamezole without rehabilitation exhibited a significant motor improvement in the ladder rung walk test but not the forelimb reaching test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a short-term increase in noradrenergic activity can lead to sustained motor improvement following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially when paired with rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
