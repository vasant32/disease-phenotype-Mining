<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> FK506 in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remain uncertain, although in vitro studies have implicated an antiexcitotoxic action involving nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and calcineurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present in vivo study demonstrates that intraperitoneal pretreatment with 1 and 10 mg/kg FK506, doses that reduced the volume of ischemic cortical damage by 56-58%, did not decrease excitotoxic damage induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29959">quinolinate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, and AMPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, intravenous FK506 did not reduce the volume of striatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29959">quinolinate</z:chebi> lesions at a dose (1 mg/kg) that decreased ischemic cortical damage by 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporal window for FK506 neuroprotection was defined in studies demonstrating efficacy using intravenous administration at 120 min, but not 180 min, after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK801 reduced both ischemic and excitotoxic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological data concerning striatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29959">quinolinate</z:chebi> lesions were replicated in neurochemical experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MK801, but not FK506, attenuated the loss of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> decarboxylase and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity induced by intrastriatal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29959">quinolinate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contrasting efficacy of FK506 in ischemic and excitotoxic lesion models cannot be explained by drug pharmacokinetics, because brain FK506 content rose rapidly using both treatment protocols and was sustained at a neuroprotective level for 3 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although these data indicate that an antiexcitotoxic mechanism is unlikely to mediate the neuroprotective action of FK506 in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the finding that intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) reduced ischemic cortical damage is consistent with the proposed role of calcineurin </plain></SENT>
