<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten-minute MCAO preconditioning significantly attenuated 24-hour MCAO-induced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> accumulation by 40% to 60% in ischemic core and perifocal areas, and GCS activities improved by 60% to 70% in both areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, potentially toxic levels of brain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> induced by MCAO were attenuated to intermediate levels in preconditioned animals; brain GCS activity was relatively preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ischemic tolerance, GCS appears to modulate otherwise high levels of brain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
