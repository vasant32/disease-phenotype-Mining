<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous danger signal molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous report, we showed that HMGB1 is massively released during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> damaging process in the postischemic brain and triggers inflammatory processes, like microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>siRNA-mediated HMGB1 knockdown markedly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, confirming the crucial role played by HMGB1 in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed neuroprotective effects of glycyrrhizin (GL) in the postischemic rat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GL, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpene</z:chebi> present in the roots and rhizomes of licorice, Glycyrrhiza glabra, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that GL binds directly to HMGB1, and inhibits its chemoattractant and mitogenic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of GL (10mg/kg) intravenously at 3 or 6h after MCAO reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes to 12.9±4.2% and 46.2±9.9%, respectively, of untreated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotective effect was accompanied by improvements in motor impairment and neurological deficits and suppressions of microglia activation and proinflammatory cytokine induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GL almost completely blocked HMGB1 secretion in the postischemic brain and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-treated microglia cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HMGB1 phosphorylation, which is the initial step for HMGB1 secretion, and the interaction between HMGB1 and protein kinase C (PKC) or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) were suppressed dose-dependently by GL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesized that the blockage for the putative phosphorylation sites in HMGB1 by GL might be attributed to this suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to the anti-inflammatory effects, we found that GL has anti-excitotoxic and anti-oxidative effects in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together these results indicate that GL has neuroprotective efficacy in the postischemic brain via its anti-inflammatory, anti-excitotoxic, and anti-oxidative effects and in particular, it exerts anti-inflammatory effect, at least in part, by inhibiting HMGB1 secretion </plain></SENT>
