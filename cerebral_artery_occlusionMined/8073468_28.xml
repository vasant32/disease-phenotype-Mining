<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic cerebral injury is associated with activation of the blood coagulation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the contribution of fibrin formation to microvascular injury during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, we have studied the time course and the localization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in cerebral microvessels and the surrounding tissues during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in a well-described nonhuman primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral tissues from adolescent male baboons were examined after 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 3) and after 3 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 1-hour (n = 6), 4-hour (n = 3), and 24-hour (n = 4) reperfusion; tissues from control primates (n = 3) also were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>Fibrin deposition</z:mpath> was detected by immunohistochemical techniques using the fibrin-specific monoclonal antibody MH-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number and size distribution of microvessels associated with fibrin were quantified by video-imaging microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibrin was associated with microvessels only in the ischemic zone where severe neuronal injury was documented, its frequency increasing with the reperfusion period (F4,26 = 3.80, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extravascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> was significantly increased by 24-hour reperfusion compared with the other subjects (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preischemia infusion of the anti-tissue factor monoclonal antibody TF9-6B4 resulted in significant reduction of intramicrovascular fibrin (P &lt; .038 versus no intervention) at 1-hour reperfusion but had no effect on extravascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that microvascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> accumulates in a time-dependent manner during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion and that exposure of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion and that exposure of plasma to perivascular tissue factor is partially responsible for occlusion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> the large plasma protein fibrinogen extravasates and interacts with parenchymal tissue factor, forming significant extravascular fibrin by 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
