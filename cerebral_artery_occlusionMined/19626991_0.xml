<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of dl-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of transient MCAO was established using the suture method of Longa by blocking middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) with a nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow was restored by the withdrawal of the nylon suture 2 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats (n=20) were prepared in similar fashion, but without occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operated rats were randomizely divided into 2 groups (n=20 for each): vehicle group rats were only administered vegetable oil 2 mL twice daily for 3 days and NBP group rats were administrated NBP 25 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit were determined by TTC staining and Longa's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF and bFGF protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NBP markedly inhibited the neurological deficit and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as compare to vehicle group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NBP significantly upregulated VEGF and bFGF expression in both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the peripheral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and hippocampus regions in contrast with sham-operated and vehicle group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBP has protective effects for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through upregulating the expression of VEGF and bFGF </plain></SENT>
