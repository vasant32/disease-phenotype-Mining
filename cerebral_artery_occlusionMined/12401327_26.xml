<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the time-course of caspase-3 activation, and the evolution of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced active caspase-3 immunoreactivity in the striatum but not the cortex at 3 and 6 h time points post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using a novel approach to visualize enzymatic activity, deltaC-APP, a C-terminal cleavage product of APP generated by caspase-3, was found to immunolocalize to the same areas as active caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling studies demonstrated co-localization of these two proteins at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further double-labeling experiments revealed that active caspase-3 was confined to neuronal cells which were still viable and thus immunoreactive for NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation, assessed histologically by terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL), was observed in a small number of cells in the striatum as early as 3 h, but only began to appear in the cortex by 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was progressive, and by 24 h post-reperfusion, large portions of both the striatum and cortex showed TUNEL positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, double-labeling of active caspase-3 with TUNEL showed only minimal co-localization at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time-points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, caspase-3 activation is an event that appears to occur prior to DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a confirmation of the histological TUNEL data, 24 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also induced the generation of nucleosome fragments, evidenced by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced substrate cleavage biochemical approach, spectrin P120 fragment, a caspase-specific cleavage product of alpha II spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, was shown to be elevated by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain concentrations of both nucleosomes and spectrin P120 correlate with the degree of injury previously assessed by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings suggest a possible association between caspase-3 activation and ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> brain injury </plain></SENT>
