<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence has demonstrated that postconditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> provided neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effect of postconditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> is associated with inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and mediated by activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 90 min and then treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological deficit scores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were evaluated at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatial learning and memory was examined by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins were studied by TUNEL, immunohistochemistry and western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect and the amount of p-Akt after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> administration with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postconditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and 1.5 MAC significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and markedly improved spatial learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postconditioning also reduced apoptotic cells, upregulated Bcl-2 and downregulated P53 and Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> abolished the neuroprotective effect and prevented the increasing of p-Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest postconditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (1.0 MAC and 1.5 MAC) not only reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but also improved learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study further showed that this neuroprotective effect may be partly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibiting neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
