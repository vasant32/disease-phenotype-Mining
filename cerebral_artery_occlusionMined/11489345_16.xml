<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A transient ischemic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was used to examine the role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as measured by DNA fragmentation and infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery was occluded for either 30 min or 2 h in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One set of animals was pretreated with diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, 30 min prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were reperfused and allowed to survive for 2 or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was assayed by in situ end labeling in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> core and penumbral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific cortical and subcortical regions were measured using quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was seen only on the ischemic side of the brains in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the DDTC-treated groups showed significantly increased DNA fragmentation within the ischemic side compared to the saline control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DDTC treatment also caused an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume based on triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed NF-kappaB activation peaking 15 min following reperfusion and that this activation was blocked by the DDTC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the use of NF-kappaB inhibitors to block cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> needs to be carefully examined because global inhibitors may not promote neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
