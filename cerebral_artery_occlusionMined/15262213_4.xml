<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current investigation examined the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the insular cortex (IC) under both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments were done in anaesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>) administration on levels of amino acids and of endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> obtained by microdialysis and its effect on neuronal activity of cells located in the insular cortex were measured in the absence of, and following permanent occlusion of, the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, intravenous (i.v.) injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> resulted in a significant increase (greater than 25 spikes/bin) in the spontaneous activity of neurons located within the insular cortex, while there was a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) levels measured in IC dialysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) resulted in a biphasic response consisting of a transient increase in the extracellular concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, followed by sustained elevations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, but reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> levels 4 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO also resulted in a significant increase in neuronal activity in the IC (from 28 +/- 9 to 120 +/- 88 spikes/bin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This MCAO-induced excitation was completely blocked following the prior intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> administration also resulted in a delay in the progression and decrease in the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by approximately 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> excites neurons in the insular cortex by decreasing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> release (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>) and it plays a role in attenuating the MCAO-induced excitability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of these neurons </plain></SENT>
