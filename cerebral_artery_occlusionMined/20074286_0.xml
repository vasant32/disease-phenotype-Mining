<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim- We evaluated the feasibility and safety of combined IV thrombolysis with abciximab and reduced dose rtPA in a 3- to 6-h time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively (March 2002 to February 2005) studied patients with symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion on computed tomography (CT) angiography and absence of major early ischemic changes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EIC</z:e>) on non-contrast CT (NCCT) within 3-6 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with IV abciximab and half-standard dose rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome parameters were symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH), early clinical improvement and functional independence at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score &lt; or = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 13 patients, mean age was 62 +/- 11 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-treatment time 4.8 +/- 0.9 h and median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 11 (interquartile range 6.5-13.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sICH occurred in one patient (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed early clinical improvement in four patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (46%) were functionally independent at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and absence of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EIC</z:e> on NCCT, combined IV thrombolysis with abciximab and half-standard dose rtPA was feasible and seemed to be safe if applied within 3-6 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
