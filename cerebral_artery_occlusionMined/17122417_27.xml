<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phagocyte cells, involving resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages, secrete both protective and toxic molecules and thus represent a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to monitor phagocytic activity after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO) were intravenously injected after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and monitored by high resolution MRI for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We here present the first MRI data showing in vivo phagocyte-labeling obtained in mice with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>USPIO-enhanced MRI kinetic analysis disclosed an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> surrounding the ischemic lesion and in the contralateral hemisphere via the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The imaging data collected during the first 36 hours postinjury suggested a spread of USPIO-related signal from ipsi- to contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging data correlated with histochemical analysis showing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> remote from the lesion and ingestion of nanoparticles by microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-tracking of phagocyte cells is feasible in mice, which may have critical therapeutic implications given the potential neurotoxicity of activated microglia/macrophages in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
