<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify the distinguishing metabolic characteristics of brain tissue salvaged by reperfusion following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 120 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 120 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats received an intravenous bolus injection of [1-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> plus [1,2-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently two brain regions considered to represent penumbra and ischemic core, i.e. the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen plus lower parietal cortex, respectively, were analyzed with (13)C NMRS and HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated four metabolic events that distinguished the reperfused penumbra from the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) Improved astrocytic metabolism demonstrated by increased amounts of [4,5-(13)C]glutamine and improved <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity was better preserved although the flux of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase into the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) cycle in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons was halved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> content was at control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons used relatively more astrocytic metabolites derived from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(4) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> synthesis was not increased despite decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle via <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core both neuronal and astrocytic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle activity declined significantly despite reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The utilization of astrocytic precursors originating from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase pathway was markedly reduced compared the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase pathway in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and completely stopped in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> level fell significantly and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that preservation of astrocytic metabolism is essential for neuronal survival and a predictor for recovery </plain></SENT>
