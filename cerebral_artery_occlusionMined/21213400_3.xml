<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aims to identify the therapeutic effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were fed KRG extract (100 mg/kg/day per orally) or saline after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests for neurological deficits, using the modified neurologic severity score and the corner turn test, were performed before the ischemic event, and one, three, and seven days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of cytokines were measured three and seven days after the operation, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed after seven days by staining brain tissue with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of KRG significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and rapidly improved neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 were higher in tMCAO-operated rats than in the sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were attenuated by daily KRG intake for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-10 levels were significantly increased in KRG-fed rats, as compared to sham-operated and saline-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that KRG provides neuroprotection for rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection may be due to raised IL-10 expression and a reduction in the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
