<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited published data describing the mechanisms through which it acts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> assays: migration, proliferation, differentiation into tube-like structures in Matrigel™ and spheroid development assays in human brain microvessel endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was performed on protein extraction from hCMEC/D3 stimulated with citicoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis of citicoline signalling pathways was previously studied using a Kinexus phospho-protein screening array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assay was performed by seeding hCMEC/D3 on to glass coverslips in serum poor medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a pilot in vivo study, transient MCAO in rats was carried out with and without citicoline treatment (1000 mg/Kg) applied at the time of occlusion and subsequently every 3 days until euthanasia (21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascularity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-affected regions was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Citicoline presented no mitogenic and chemotactic effects on hCMEC/D3; however, it significantly increased wound recovery, the formation of tube-like structures in Matrigel™ and enhanced spheroid development and sprouting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Citicoline induced the expression of phospho-extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kinexus assays showed an over-expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Knock-down of IRS-1 with targeted siRNA in our hCMEC/D3 inhibited the pro-angiogenic effects of citicoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of surviving cells was higher in the presence of citicoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Citicoline treatment significantly increased the numbers of new, active CD105-positive microvessels following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate both a pro-angiogenic and protective effect of citicoline on hCMEC/D3 in vitro and following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in vivo </plain></SENT>
