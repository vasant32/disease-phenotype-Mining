<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> induce the excessive release of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> resulting in neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, moderate activation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptors can promote neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used in vitro and in vivo models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to test the hypothesis that low doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> could induce neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> does induce a robust, dose-dependent, neuroprotective response in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar dose dependant neuroprotective effect was observed in rats that received an embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in behavioral outcomes were observed in rats when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> administration delayed for up to 12 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">Methamphetamine</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection was significantly reduced in slice cultures by the addition of D1 and D2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48561">dopamine receptor antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of slice cultures with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> resulted in the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-mediated activation of AKT in a PI3K dependant manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar increase in phosphorylated AKT was observed in the striatum, cortex and hippocampus of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> treated rats following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">Methamphetamine</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection was lost in rats when PI3K activity was blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> treatment decreased both cleaved caspase 3 levels in slice cultures following OGD and TUNEL staining within the striatum and cortex in rats following transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> can mediate neuroprotection through activation of a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>/PI3K/AKT-signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
