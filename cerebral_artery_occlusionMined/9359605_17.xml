<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on the reactive expression of ecto-5'-nucleotidase in rat brain was studied 6 h and 1, 2 and 7 days after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of 5'-nucleotidase in the infarcted brain was compared to markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) and microglia (complement receptor type 3, antibody OX42) using histological staining or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5'-Nucleotidase could be associated with reactive astrocytes by immunohistochemistry and with reactive microglia by enzyme histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the untreated control 5'-nucleotidase was associated with astrocytes only in the hippocampus and the submeningeal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> the enzyme was expressed on reactive astrocytes in the tissue surrounding the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual reactive astrocytes were observed 6 h after MCAO and the astrocytic expression became continuously enhanced during the following days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An enzyme histochemical analysis of 5'-nucleotidase activity revealed a postischemic increase in reaction product around the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAO a discrete band (0.2-0.4 mm) of reaction product characterized the rim of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This band of activity of 5'-nucleotidase colocalized with a band of immunoreactivity for OX42, indicative of an intense accumulation of 5'-nucleotidase expressing microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> following permanent MCAO results in an upregulation of the capacity for the hydrolysis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> within the tissue adjacent to the infarcted volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">Nucleotides</z:chebi> released from the damaged cells can be hydrolyzed and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> eventually formed may exert neuroprotective functions limiting the extent of damage </plain></SENT>
