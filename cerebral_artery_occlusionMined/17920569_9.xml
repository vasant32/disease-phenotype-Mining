<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oxidative DNA damage has been proposed to be a major contributor to focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of oxidative DNA damage in remote damage secondary to the primary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated oxidative damage within the ventroposterior nucleus (VPN) after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the possible protective effect of ebselen, one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase mimic, on delayed degeneration in the VPN after distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage in the ipsilateral VPN was examined by Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxidative DNA damage and base repair enzyme activity were assessed by analyzing immunoreactivity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> DNA glycosylase (OGG1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of intact neurons in the ipsilateral VPN decreased by 52% compared to the contralateral side in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group 2 weeks after distal cerebral cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of 8-ohdG significantly increased while OGG1 immunoreactivity significantly decreased in the ipsilateral VPN 2 weeks after distal cortical infarction (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle treatment, ebselen significantly attenuated the neuron loss, ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increase in 8-ohdG level as well as decrease in OGG1 level within the ipsilateral VPN (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OGG1 was further demonstrated to mainly express in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that oxidative DNA damage may be involved in the delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the VPN region following distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ebselen protects against the delayed damage in the VPN when given at 24 h following distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
