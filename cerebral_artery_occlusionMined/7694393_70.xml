<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> has been implicated as a mediator of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A number of indicators of brain nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production (nitric and cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate [cGMP] concentrations and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity) were examined after bilateral carotid ligation and right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> was significantly increased in the right versus left cortex 5, 10, and 20 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (P &lt; .05), with a return to baseline at 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in cerebellar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical levels of cGMP were increased at 10, 20, and 60 minutes after occlusion, with significant right-to-left differences (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar concentrations of cGMP were also increased but without significant side-to-side differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity increased approximately 10-fold from baseline 10 minutes after occlusion in the right cortex but decreased markedly by 60 minutes from its peak at 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right-to-left difference in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity was significant at 20 minutes (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of rats with NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor, abolished the rise in <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a sharp transient increase in the activity of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase occurs during the first hour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which leads to a burst in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production and activation of guanylate cyclase </plain></SENT>
