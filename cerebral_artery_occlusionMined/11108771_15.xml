<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the deleterious role of several proinflammatory mediators, including P-selectin, in reperfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is well established, the role of E-selectin has not been fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: E-selectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was studied at 4, 10, and 24 hours after reperfusion with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction in mice (n=18) subjected to transient intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice received intravenous injection with anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody (10, 35, or 50 microg), nonimmune IgG, or vehicle immediately before MCAO and 90 minutes later (n=85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Others received anti-E-selectin antibody 3 or 6 hours after MCAO (n=32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activity was measured in sham-operated mice and after 10 hours of reperfusion in saline-, nonimmune IgG-, or anti-E-selectin IgG-treated cohorts (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial cerebral blood flow was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, and outcomes were assessed by neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes with the use of planimetric analysis of triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upregulated E-selectin expression occurred in the ischemic cerebral vasculature within 4 hours of reperfusion and persisted for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-E-selectin antibody increased ischemic cortical cerebral blood flow up to 2.6-fold (P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to dose-dependent reductions in neurological deficits (P:&lt;0.05), mortality, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (P:&lt;0.01 for 35 and 50 microg), anti-E-selectin treatment reduced cerebral neutrophil accumulation (P:&lt;0.05) and was neuroprotective even if delayed until 3 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P:&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a functional role for E-selectin in the pathogenesis of tissue injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion and suggest that E-selectin blockade may be clinically useful in the treatment of reperfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
