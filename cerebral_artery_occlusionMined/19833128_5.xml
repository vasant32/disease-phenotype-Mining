<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to determine whether cooling to approximately 33 degrees C provides enduring benefit when initiated 1 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO, via electrocautery) in adult rats and whether protection depends upon treatment duration and cooling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, systemic cooling was induced in non-anesthetized rats through a whole-body exposure technique that used fans and water mist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison to normothermic controls, 12- and 48-h bouts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly lessened functional impairment, such as skilled reaching ability, and lesion volume out to a 1-month survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, brain-selective cooling was induced in awake rats via a water-cooled metal strip implanted underneath the temporalis muscle overlying the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of a 48-h cooling treatment significantly mitigated injury and behavioral impairment whereas a 12-h treatment did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show that while systemic and focal techniques are effective when initiated after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pMCAO, they differ in efficacy depending upon the treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A direct and uncomplicated comparison between methods is problematic, however, due to unknown gradients in brain temperature and the use of two separate experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, prolonged cooling, even when delayed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pMCAO, provides enduring behavioral and histological protection sufficient to suggest that it will be clinically effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, further pre-clinical work is needed to improve treatment protocols, such as identifying the optimal depth of cooling, and how these factors interact with cooling method </plain></SENT>
