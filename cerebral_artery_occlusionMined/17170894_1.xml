<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the poor natural history of untreated symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we have attempted emergent reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> seen on our cranial base service over the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requiring a life-saving "strokectomy" within 48 hours, which left him permanently hemiplegic, hemianopic, and hemihypesthetic after a failed attempt at reperfusion by superselective endovascular injection of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other two patients, who were aphasic and densely hemiparetic, underwent successful emergent embolectomy with reperfusion established within 5 and 12 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the two is now neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the second is left with a subtle monoparesis but is independent in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery embolism</z:e> in cranial base patients usually occurs in a closely monitored hospital setting, we are presented with a unique opportunity for early successful operative intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Principles for optimizing outcome include: early recognition and diagnosis, maximization of medical therapy during the diagnostic workup prior to embolectomy (induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intravascular volume expansion, and pharmacologic cerebral metabolic demand reduction), confirmation that the involved region does not have absent blood flow by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>/computed tomography, early operative intervention, and careful surgical technique </plain></SENT>
