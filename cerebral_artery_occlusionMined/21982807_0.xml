<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prostatic acid phosphatase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>), an enzyme that has long served as a diagnostic marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, has been recently demonstrated to exhibit ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity, and dephosphorylate endogenous extracellular <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore tested the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> has sustained and potent neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that hPAP produced significant neuroprotection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as evident from significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic time window for hPAP in rat focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was limited from 6 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 1.5 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study suggested that <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> is a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic injury, especially during perioperative period </plain></SENT>
