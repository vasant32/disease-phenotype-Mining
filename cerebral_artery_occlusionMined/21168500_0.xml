<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSC-transplantation in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the neuroimmunomodulatory functions of human MSCs, transplanted in a rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that in a human mesenchymal stem cell line, B10 cell transplantation decreased the accumulation of Iba-1(+) microglia and GFAP(+) astrocytes, and inhibited proinflammatory gene expression in the core and ischemic border zone (IBZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the proinflammatory genes iNOS, which was expressed in microglia/macrophage, was persistently inhibited up to 7days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo laser capture microdissection and double immunofluorescence staining, and in vitro B10 cell culture experiments showed that, in inflammatory conditions, B10 cells expressed cytokines and growth factors including IL-5, fractalkine, IGF-1, GDNF and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractalkine and IL-5 inhibited cytokine-induced proinflammatory gene expression including iNOS in a human microglia cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results demonstrate that MSC transplantation suppresses MCAO focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, possibly through expression of fractalkine and IL-5 </plain></SENT>
