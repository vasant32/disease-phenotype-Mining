<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral IR model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly divided into MCAO group, environment modification group (EM group) and willed movement therapy group (WM group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were evaluated for neurological deficits and decapitated on days 3, 7 and 15 after the reperfusion to examine the expressions of NT-3 and GAP-43 in the ischemic brain tissues by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with MCAO and EM groups, the rats in WM group showed significantly lowered grade of neurological deficits (P&lt;0.05) at 15 days and significantly increased the expressions of NT-3 and GAP-43 (P&lt;0.05) at 7 and 15 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the expression of NT-3 and GAP-43 between MCAO and EM groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of NT-3 was positively correlated to that of GAP-43 in the ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Willed movement therapy increases the expression of NT-3 and GAP-43 in the ischemic brain area in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion, which is probably related to nerve regeneration and repair </plain></SENT>
