<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> administered during the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might foster neuroprotective microglial activity through ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found in vitro that BV2 cell line showed upregulated expression of K(ATP) channel subunits in response to pro-inflammatory signals and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> increases the reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of microglia, phagocytic capacity and TNFÎ± release </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry with specific markers to neuron, astroglia, microglia and lymphocytes showed that resident amoeboid microglia are the main cell population in that necrotic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These reactive microglial cells express SUR1, SUR2B and Kir6.2 proteins that assemble in functional K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide that evidence for the key role of K(ATP) channels in the control of microglial reactivity are consistent with a microglial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> into the ischemic brain and suggest a neuroprotective role of microglia in the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
