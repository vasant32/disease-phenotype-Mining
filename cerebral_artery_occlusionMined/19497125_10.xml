<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is usually characterized by a reduction in local blood flow and metabolism and by disruption of the blood-brain barrier in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and opening of the blood-brain barrier in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with enhanced expression of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here, we found an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 24.8 +/- 2% and a reduced neurological function after two hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), followed by 48 hours of recirculation in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed enhanced expression of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the smooth muscle cells of the ischemic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and associated intracerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, given intraperitoneal zero or 6 hours after the ischemic event, reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume significantly (11.8 +/- 2% and 14.6 +/- 3%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05), improved neurological function, normalized expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, and reduced expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of U0126 12 hours after MCAO did not alter the expression of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry showed no overlap in expression between MMP-9/TIMP-1 and the astrocyte/glial cell marker GFAP in the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data are the first to show that the elevated vascular expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, are transcriptionally regulated via the MEK/ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
