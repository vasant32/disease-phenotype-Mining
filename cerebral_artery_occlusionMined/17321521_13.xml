<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested other potential mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Namely, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> action at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors and an antioxidative action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi>-treated rats had significantly improved neurobehavioral deficit scores after 24 h and showed approximately 75% reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were unaffected by ICI 182,780 (a high affinity and pure receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) administered intravenously, or intracisternally to avoid possible lack of brain penetration, 15 min before intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats subjected to 2 h MCAo followed by 22 h reperfusion, 1.8-fold and 2.9-fold increases of F(2)-IsoPs and F(4) neuroprostanes, respectively, as relatively stable markers of oxidative damage, were measured in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the corresponding contralateral hemisphere or sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi> given at 3 h after the start of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reduced the IsoPs and NeuroPs to sham control levels, and also inhibited their production by chemically induced <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with at least part of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>'s marked neuroprotection in focal cerebral ischemic injury being due to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity but not by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> action on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (212 words) </plain></SENT>
