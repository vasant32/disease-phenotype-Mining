<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA has been shown to be up-regulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and also the time window of its expression extends from 4 to 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to elucidate the protective effect of Etoricoxib (a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50629">Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor</z:chebi>) against transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced behavioral, biochemical and histological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> reperfusion significantly caused behavioral (neurological deficits, <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>decreased locomotor activity</z:mp> and rotarod performance), biochemical (increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentration, while decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase activity) and histological (increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Etoricoxib (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed the alterations caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> however, 1 mg/kg dose was not found effective in any of the parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we can conclude that Etoricoxib has beneficial effects against transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that Etoricoxib may be considered as a potential candidate in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, clinically </plain></SENT>
