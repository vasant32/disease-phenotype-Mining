<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present studies were initiated to investigate whether p53 transactivated target genes are induced in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we applied in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and western blotting to study the temporal and spatial expression of p53 and its transcriptional targets Bax, p21 and cyclin G1 following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G1 immunoreactivity was constitutively expressed in the nuclei of cells in the choroid plexus and ependymal cell layer and in the cytoplasm of cell bodies and dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G1 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels transiently increased to 150% of contralateral levels in neurons of the ipsilateral frontal and parietal cortex and striatum 3 h following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A low level of constitutively expressed p21 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein was found in nuclei of cells in the choroid plexus, oligodendrocytes and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p21 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels gradually increased to 250% and 140% of contralateral levels in areas bordering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core up to 6 h following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p53 and Bax <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, and protein levels of p27, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, p35 and cyclin E decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and border areas with time after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The selective up-regulation of cyclin G1 and p21 in neurons in the border zone of a focal ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> indicates their involvement in an adaptive response to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible participation of cyclin G1 and p21 in a signal transduction pathway associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cellular stress is discussed </plain></SENT>
