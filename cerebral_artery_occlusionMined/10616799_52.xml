<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent findings in animals emphasize that experimental ischemic brain damage can be strikingly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>: however, the neuroprotective mechanisms are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> signaling via cognate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (ERs) within the vasculature is an important aspect of cerebral ischemic protection in the female brain, in part by amplifying intraischemic cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with the pure ER <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ICI182,780 (ICI) would increase ischemic brain damage by a blood flow-mediated mechanism was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult C57B1/6J mice were pretreated with either subcutaneous ICI (100 microg/day) or oil/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> vehicle for 1 week before 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic regional CBF was evaluated in additional cohorts using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> histology was greater in the striatum of ICI-treated females (70 +/- 3% of contralateral striatum vs. 40 +/- 12% in vehicle-treated females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical injury was not enhanced relative to control animals (39 +/- 6% of contralateral cortex in ICI group vs. 27 +/- 8% in vehicle-treated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physiologic variables and ischemic reduction of the ipsilateral cortical laser-Doppler flow signal were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, ICI treatment did not alter end-ischemic cortical or striatal CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effect of ICI was limited to females, as there were no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage or CBF between male treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> inhibits ischemic brain injury in striatum of the female by receptor-mediated mechanisms that are not linked to preservation of intraischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
