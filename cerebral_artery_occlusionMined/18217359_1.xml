<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experoments were carried out in inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs were isolated, expanded in culture and labeled with vital <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> PKH26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by injection of 5 x 10(6) rat MSCs into the tail vein on the day of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control group of animals received PBS injection (negative control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed in 1, 2, 3 and 5 days and in 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSCs were revealed in the brain on the third day transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They distributed around brain vessels in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pattern of distribution remained unchanged during 6 weeks of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> process and scar formation in the experimental group progressed 25-30 % faster than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSC transplantation stimulated endogenous stem cell proliferation on the subependimal zone of lateral ventricles (subventrecular zone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>What is more, MSC injection showed neuroprotective effect: almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> penumbra neurons in animals treated with cell therapy retained their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure, whereas in animals of control group penumbra neurons died or had signs of serious damage </plain></SENT>
