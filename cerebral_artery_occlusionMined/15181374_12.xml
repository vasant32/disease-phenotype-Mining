<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The contribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> to brain damage after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a mouse model for the visualization of leukocytes in the cerebral microcirculation in vivo and to investigate leukocyte-endothelial interaction (LEI) after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated 129/Sv mice showed physiologic LEI in pial venules as observed by intravital fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced a significant increase of LEI predominantly in pial venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of rolling and adherent leukocytes reached 36.5 +/- 13.2/100 microm x min and 22.5 +/- 7.9/100 microm x min, respectively at 120 minutes after MCAO (P = 0.016 vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, rolling and adherent leukocytes were also observed in arterioles of ischemic animals (7.3 +/- 3.0/100 microm x min rolling and 3.0 +/- 3.6/100 microm x min adherent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Capillary density was not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that leukocytes accumulate in the brain not only after transient but also after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may therefore contribute to brain damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
