<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> antibiotic, has been shown to have neuroprotective efficiency in reduction of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injuries as well as ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the rat models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion to investigate the effects of treatments with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> against the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage at 3, 12, 72, and 120 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 3, 12, 72, and 120 h and received either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> (45 mg/kg) or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the treatment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> significantly reduced the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which were proved by Evans blue assay and TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot assay verified that the administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> significantly up-regulated the expression of tight junction claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 from 3 to 120 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of real-time PCR, western blot, and gelatin zymography analyses revealed that the gene and protein expression and activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly elevated in a different time-dependent manner after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion but significantly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> could also significantly down-regulate the expression of PKCδ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage induced by reperfusion might be related to the up-regulation of tight junction proteins and inhibition of MMP-2, MMP-9, and PKCδ </plain></SENT>
