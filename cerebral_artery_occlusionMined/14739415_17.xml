<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> is a life-threatening consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and leads to an extension of the affected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The space-occupying effect due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> can be quantified in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models with the use of MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>The present study was performed to test 2 hypotheses: (1) Can quantification of the space-occupying effect due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> serve as a noninvasive measure for brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>(2) Does morphometric assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> allow determination of true <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on MRI after correction for the space-occupying effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty rats were subjected to permanent suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed after 6 or 24 hours, and hemispheric swelling was assessed morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were determined for MRI measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In study I, the space-occupying effect due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was correlated with the absolute brain water content by the wet/dry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In study II, lesion volumes corrected and uncorrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were calculated on MRI and on TTC staining and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver and intraobserver agreements for MRI measurements were excellent (r&gt;or=0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain water content and hemispheric swelling correlated well after 6 and 24 hours (r&gt;or=0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Corrected lesion volumes correlated with r=0.78 between TTC staining and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> correction, lesion volumes were overestimated by 20.3% after 6 hours and by 29.6% after 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Morphometric assessment of hemispheric swelling on MRI can determine the increase in absolute brain water content noninvasively and can also provide ischemic lesion volumes corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
