<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous study demonstrated that SMTP-7 further ameliorated infarction volume in a mouse embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model compared with tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), but the reason SMTP-7 has more beneficial effect than tPA has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether SMTP-7 has an intrinsic neuroprotective effect against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tFCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to tFCI by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following induction of tFCI, rats were randomized into two groups based on the agent administered: SMTP-7 group and vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume 24h after reperfusion, and evaluated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, the expressions of nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which play major roles in secondary brain injury and hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings showed that SMTP-7 significantly suppressed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, the expression of nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 after tFCI, and consequently attenuated ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SMTP-7 has an intrinsic neuroprotective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury through the suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and MMP-9 activation </plain></SENT>
