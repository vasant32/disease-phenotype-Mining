<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent findings have demonstrated that acupuncture and ginger can each improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that ginger pharmacopuncture, a combination of these two treatments, could increase the beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the limitation of supporting evidence, we aimed to determine whether ginger pharmacopuncture could improve cognitive function and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (Rt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO) and subjected to either acupuncture or ginger pharmacopuncture once daily over a period of 14 days after Rt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was determined every 7 days, using escape latency and retention time as indices, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> status of the rats was determined at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected either to acupuncture or to ginger pharmacopuncture at GV20 demonstrated enhanced spatial memory, and the activities of catalase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity was observed only in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cognitive enhancement was observed sooner with ginger pharmacopuncture than with acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cognitive enhancing effect of acupuncture and ginger pharmacopuncture is likely to be at least partially attributable to decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, other mechanisms may also be involved, and this requires further study </plain></SENT>
