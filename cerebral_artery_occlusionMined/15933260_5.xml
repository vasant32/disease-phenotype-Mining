<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We demonstrated previously that treatment with selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> BRL 52537 hydrochloride [(+/-)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylpiperidine] (1) has a long therapeutic window for providing ischemic neuroprotection, and (2) attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked NO production in vivo in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuronally derived NO has been shown to be deleterious in the male but not in the female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that BRL provides significant neuroprotection from transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in male but not in female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized adult male and female Wistar rats (250 to 275 g) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequacy of MCAO and reperfusion was monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry over the ipsilateral parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, male and female rats were treated in a blinded randomized fashion with vehicle saline or 1 mg/kg per hour BRL infusion started at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion and continued for 22 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were treated with vehicle or BRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in the cortex and caudoputamen (CP) complex was assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 72 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume (percentage of ipsilateral structure; mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was attenuated significantly in male rats with BRL treatment (cortex 23+/-5%; CP 44+/-6%; n=15) compared with vehicle-treated male rats (cortex 38+/-4%; CP 66+/-4%; n=15) but not in female rats (BRL-cortex 26+/-6; CP 55+/-8%; vehicle-cortex 26+/-5; CP 62+/-5%; n=10 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit score was improved in BRL-treated male rats but not in female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was not different in OVX female rats treated with vehicle or BRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data: (1) demonstrate that this dose of selective KOR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> provides ischemic neuroprotection in male but not female rats, (2) demonstrate that the lack of protection by BRL is not attributable to circulating ovarian hormones, and (3) highlight the importance of using animal models of both sexes in preclinical studies of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
