<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1), a potent inhibitor of complement activation, has been shown to protect brain cells against cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) injury due to its decay-accelerating activity for C3/C5 convertase and co-factor activity for C3b/C4b degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of short consensus repeats (SCRs) 15-18, one of active domains of sCR1 with high C3b/C4b degradability, has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the protective effect of recombinant SCR(15-18) protein in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced focal CI/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recombinant SCR(15-18) protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded to its optimal bioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: sham-operated group, CI/R group, and SCR(15-18)+CI/R group pretreated with 20 mg/kg SCR(15-18) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of MCAO and subsequent 24 hours of reperfusion, rats were evaluated for neurological deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, C3b deposition, and morphological changes in cerebral tissue were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCR(15-18) pretreatment induced a 20% reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and an improvement of neurological function with 22Â·2% decrease of neurological deficit scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cerebral neutrophils infiltration by SCR(15-18) was indicated from the reduction of myeloperoxidase activity in SCR(15-18)+CI/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased C3b deposition and improved morphological changes were also found in cerebral tissue of SCR(15-18)-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our studies suggest a definitive moderately protective effect of SCR(15-18) against CI/R damage and provide preclinical experimental evidence supporting the possibility of using it as a small anti-complement therapeutic agent for CI/R injury therapy </plain></SENT>
