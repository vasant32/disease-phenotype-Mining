<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates the cytoprotective effect of electrical <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> stimulation (ECS) as a potential neuroprotective vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inducer against ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) is thought to be an important factor that mediates neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling pathways in the brain in vivo after ECS remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured and compared infarction volumes to investigate the effect of ECS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> (Wort), a specific PI3K inhibitor of ECS-induced neuroprotection against infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between PI3K/Akt activation and neuroprotection, we used immunoblot analysis to determine the amounts of p-Akt and VEGF proteins present after ECS with or without Wort treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of ECS (pretreatment with a single ECS 6h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) were prevented by Wort pretreatment, which indicates that the PI3K/Akt pathway may mediate ECS-dependent protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECS induced p-Akt and VEGF and ECS pretreatment enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced VEGF, both of which were prevented by Wort pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a single ECS induces p-Akt and that ECS plays an important role in neuroprotection against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through VEGF induction </plain></SENT>
