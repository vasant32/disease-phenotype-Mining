<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PAR1 activation by brain-derived as well as blood-derived proteases has been shown to have variable and complex effects in a variety of animal models of neuronal injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have evaluated the effects of PAR1 on lesion volume in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or PAR1-/- C57Bl/6 mice subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that removal of PAR1 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 57% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of PAR1 or application of a PAR1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> also reduced the neuronal injury associated with intrastriatal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> to 60% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor potentiation by PAR1 activation contributes to the harmful effects of PAR1, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> on the neuroprotective phenotype of PAR1-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that MK801 reduced penumbral but not core neuronal injury in mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or intrastriatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes in both models were not significantly different between PAR1-/- mice treated with and without MK801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and dissociative <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> ketamine also renders <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced lesion volumes identical in PAR1-/- mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the ability of PAR1 activation to potentiate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor function may underlie its harmful actions during injury </plain></SENT>
