<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alteration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel function has been reported to occur in a variety of neuropathological states including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously we reported that out of five NaCh alpha subunit genes that were down-regulated, Na(v)1.1 exhibited the most dramatic and sustained alterations following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spatial and temporal time course distribution of Na(v)1.1 mRNA (in situ hybridization) and protein (immunohistochemistry) following ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by reperfusion and brain tissue was collected at 2, 6, 24, and 48 h post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of brain tissue revealed a qualitative drop in both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of Na(v)1.1 throughout ischemic regions, beginning at the early stage of injury (6 h) with dramatic losses at later stages (24 and 48 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative cell counts and optical density measurements indicated significant decreases in the percent of brain cells immunoreactive for Na(v)1.1 as well as a loss of signal in those cells positive for Na(v)1.1 in the injured cortex and striatum as compared to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double labeling with NeuN and Na(v)1.1 immunoflouresence confirmed that the predominate loss of Na(v)1.1 immunoreactivity was in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data map the time-dependent loss of Na(v)1.1 mRNA and protein following focal ischemic brain injury in the rat out to 48 h post-injury </plain></SENT>
