<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that a single administration of 3-NPA given systemically provides subsequent ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study has tested the hypothesis that 3-NPA is capable of inducing tolerance in a model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and whether 3-NPA can be truly applicable as a tolerance-inducer to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats given 3-NPA intraperitoneally revealed that the mortality of 3-NPA of 15, 20, and 25 mg/kg groups was 20.5, 38.8, and 83.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats survived without behavioral sequelae at smaller doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after 3-NPA preconditioning, the rats showing no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> underwent the permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups treated with 10 and 15 mg/kg of 3-NPA showed significantly reduced neurological deficits and infarction volumes in comparison with the control group, whereas the groups treated with 5 and 20 mg/kg of 3-NPA revealed no tolerance effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the regional SDH activity (% of control) was photometrically semi-quantified, it was observed that the activity was reduced to 90.8, 76.1, 67.8, and 64.3% in the outer layers of the cerebral cortex, and to 79.4, 67.5, 63.2, and 62.9% in the striatum 1 h after 3-NPA application (5, 10, 15, 20 mg/kg), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the preconditioning with 3-NPA is clearly shown in the setting of permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the preconditioning with this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxin demonstrated a rather narrow safety margin (critical threshold) </plain></SENT>
