<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anaesthesised Wistar rats with permanent ipsilateral carotid artery ligation and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (duration of occlusion, 2 h) followed by reperfusion (24 h), intravenous administration of ACEA 1021 (bolus: 10 mg/kg, 15 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; infusion: 7 mg/kg/h for 6 h beginning 30 min after occlusion of the artery) produced a 32% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in Sprague-Dawley rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 h) followed by 24 h of reperfusion, identical treatment with ACEA 1021 decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed these effects in the transient model, in that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume observed using apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps was significantly smaller after 24 h in the ACEA 1021-treated rats compared with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in perfusion signal intensity after reperfusion was more pronounced in the ACEA 1021-treated rats than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Fisher 344 rats with permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, ACEA 1021 induced a dose-related decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which was associated with an improvement in neurological outcome as measured by the rope suspension procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of the same dose regimen, as above, in Fisher rats with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 68% </plain></SENT>
