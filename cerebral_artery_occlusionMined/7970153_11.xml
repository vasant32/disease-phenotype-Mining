<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although investigators have demonstrated that endothelins are produced by cerebral microvessel endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons in vitro, whether endothelins are produced during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to measure endothelin-1 in brain tissue and plasma following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and to examine the relationship between brain tissue and plasma endothelin-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery of rabbits was occluded for 2, 4 or 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of endothelin-1 in both brain tissue and plasma was determined by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the concentrations of endothelin-1 in the ischemic brain tissue and plasma are both significantly increased after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data confirm that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and marked increase of endothelin-1 in brain tissue and plasma is associated with focal ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility that endothelin-1 has a role in neuronal cell damage following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> warrants further attention </plain></SENT>
