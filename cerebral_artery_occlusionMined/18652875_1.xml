<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The novel compound designated ND-309, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-alpha-hydroxypropanoate is a new metabolite of danshen in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate whether ND-309 has a protective effect on brain injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and to determine the possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male SD rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by bipolar electro-coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were assessed to evaluate the brain patho-physiological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectrophotometric or spectrofluorometric assay methods were used to determine the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-peroxidase (GSH-Px), contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), as well as respiratory control ratio of the brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that treatment with ND-309 significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, ND-309 significantly increased the brain ATP content, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism, attenuated the elevation of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, the decrease in SOD, GSH-Px activity and the generation of ROS in brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these findings indicate that ND-309 has the protective potential against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury and its protective effects may be due to the amelioration of cerebral energy metabolism and its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property </plain></SENT>
