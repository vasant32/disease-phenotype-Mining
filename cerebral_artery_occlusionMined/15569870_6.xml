<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To identify if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) exhibits impaired functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with its normotensive reference strain, the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In study 1, a 2-mm distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) was performed in both strains and recovery assessed using a 33-point neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because SHRSPs displayed much larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than WKYs, study 2 and study 3 involved extending the length of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the WKY to increase the volume and distribution of infarction to comparable levels with SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were assessed with the neurological score, tapered beam walk, and cylinder tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In study 1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (expressed as a percent of contralateral hemisphere) was WKY 13.1+/-3% and SHRSP 19.8+/-1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial neurological deficit was greater (WKY 25+/-1, SHRSP 22+/-1, out of a possible 33) and subsequent recovery was poorer in SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In studies 2 and 3, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and distribution (study 2, WKY 21.8+/-1.3%, SHRSP 22.9+/-3%; study 3, WKY 17.2+/-2%, SHRSP 16.5+/-3%) and initial neurological deficit at 2 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (study 2 WKY 23+/-1, SHRSP 22+/-2; study 3 WKY 25+/-1 and SHRSP 23+/-1; mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) were comparable between strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, whereas WKY recovered toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scores, SHRSP scored significantly lower 2 weeks (study 2) and 4 weeks (study 3) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beam walk data revealed long-term impairment in SHRSP contralateral limb use, compared with WKY, at days 3, 7, and 28 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SHRSP exhibit impaired functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with WKY </plain></SENT>
