<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an animal model, the authors tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> constricts collateral vessels in the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded proximally and cannulated distally in anesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the area at risk for infarction was detected by perfusing the cannulated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch with microsphere-free blood during systemic injection of radioactive microspheres (shadow flow technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to collateral-dependent and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrum was measured during intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (10 and 40 mg/kg/minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> produced a dose-related reduction of blood flow to collateral-dependent cerebrum, increased collateral vessel resistance in large cerebral arteries and collateral vessels, and decreased cerebral artery perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, blood flow to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrum was not altered because a decrease in small vessel resistance effectively compensated for a decrease in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> produces constriction of collateral vessels in the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This response is clearly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small cerebral vessels, which dilate during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
