<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in male Wistar rats (n = 62) using an intraluminal monofilament blockade of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the animals were killed at different durations of reperfusion (0.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, n = 4 per time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats (n = 4) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats not subjected to any surgical procedure (n = 4) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain sections (5 microns) were analyzed, using an in situ ApopTag kit, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and immunohistochemical double-staining methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six rats subjected to 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were killed at 24 h for measurement of DNA fragmentation by gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that within a coronal section, DNA fragmentation was present in zero to three cells in each hemisphere of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham-operated rats as well as in the contralateral hemisphere of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation increased as early as 0.5 h (8 +/- 6), peaked at 24-48 h (213 +/- 59), and persisted for 4 weeks (10 +/- 2) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Groups of cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation (&gt; 95% neurons) were located primarily in the inner boundary zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With use of gel electrophoresis, purified DNA obtained from the ischemic tissue exhibited the characteristic nucleosome ladder pattern associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
