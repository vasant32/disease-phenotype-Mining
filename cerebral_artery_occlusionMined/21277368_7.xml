<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous work demonstrates that both steroids compensate neuronal damage and activate distinct neuroprotective strategies such as improving local energy metabolism and abating pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study explored steroid hormone-mediated protection from brain damage and restoration of behavioral function after 1h transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male and ovariectomized female rats were studied 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both steroid hormones reduced the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in males and females to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A maximum effect of ~60-70% reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was evident after P and a combined treatment with both hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> protection was seen in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing of motor and sensory behavioral revealed an equal high degree of functional recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three hormone groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene expression studies in the delineated penumbra revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) alpha and beta are locally up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>tMCAO-mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL5 and interleukin 6 was attenuated by E and P, whereas the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was fortified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local expression of microglia/macrophage/lymphocyte markers, i.e. Iba1, CD68 and CD3, were significantly reduced in the penumbra after hormone treatment suggesting attenuation of microglia and lymphocyte attraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the neuroprotective potency of a combined treatment with E and P under ischemic conditions in both sexes and point at the regulation of chemokine-microglia/lymphocyte interactions as a supposable mechanism implicated in cell protection </plain></SENT>
