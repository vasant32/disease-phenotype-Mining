<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) have become well established drugs for the treatment of major risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since several studies provided evidence that ARBs and TZDs also have additional anti-inflammatory effects, we hypothesized that a combined treatment with the ARB, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, and the TZD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, ameliorates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by synergistic anti-inflammatory actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normotensive Wistar rats were pre-treated for 5 days with vehicle (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>), 0.2 mg/kg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (s.c.), and/or 2 and/or 20 mg/kg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (p.o.), respectively and underwent 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with successive reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were determined 24 h and 48 h after MCAO, respectively, followed by tissue sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> had reduced neurological deficits 24 h and 48 h after MCAO, respectively (P&lt;0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced by treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and their respective combination (each P&lt;0.05) 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and their combination resulted in significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the inflammatory markers CXCL1 and TNFalpha in vivo (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is equally effective compared to their single applications concerning neuroprotection and attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that a direct synergistic neuroprotective action of parallel ARB and TZD treatment is unlikely </plain></SENT>
