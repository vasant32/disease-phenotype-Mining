<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mitotic marker BrdU was given on days 5 to 7, and TNF-alpha antibody or control protein was infused into the lateral ventricle of the ischemic hemisphere from day 8 to 14 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of infusions, the TNF-alpha antibody-treated rats showed markedly fewer new striatal and hippocampal neurons, as compared to animals given control protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that TNF-alpha, probably acting via its receptor TNFR2, can promote the survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-generated hippocampal and striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
