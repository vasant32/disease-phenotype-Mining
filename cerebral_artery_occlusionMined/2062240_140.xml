<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted spin-echo images using strong gradients (b value of 1413 s/mm2) demonstrated a significant increase in signal intensity in ischemic regions as early as 14 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in comparison to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, contralateral hemisphere (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three rats subjected to permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O, diffusion-weighted MRI demonstrated an increased signal intensity on the first image following occlusion and continued to increase during the 4-h observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted images failed to demonstrate significant injury until approximately 2 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O </plain></SENT>
