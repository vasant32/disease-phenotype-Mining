<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any disturbance of brain perfusion may result in blood-brain barrier dysfunction due to pericyte migration from the microvascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on ischemic brain injury has been clearly shown in models of both global and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leakage of plasma proteins contributes to the extension of neuronal injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has a neuroprotective influence during the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This line of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> impelled us to investigate the possible role of the pericytes in the occurrence of hypothermic protection during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined at the ultrastructural level the effect of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on microvascular pericyte responses using a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty rats were divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats except the control group (first group), which was used to determine the pericyte <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second group, pericyte response to irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> under normothermic conditions was examined at the end of the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third group, pericyte response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was examined under normothermic conditions three hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the fourth group, temporalis muscle temperature was maintained at 27-29 degrees C for 1h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and pericyte response was then examined at the ultrastructural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In ischemic normothermic conditions at the end of the first hour (Group 2), a separation was observed between pericytes and the basement membrane and this was interpreted as pericyte migration from the microvascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In ischemic normothermic conditions at the end of the third hour (Group 3), basement membrane disorganization and increased space between the basement membranes were seen in addition to the differentiation of second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In ischemic hypothermic conditions at the end of the first hour (Group 4), pericyte separation or migration from basement membrane were not seen and the blood-brain barrier remained firm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings were interpreted by the authors as a possible relationship between pericyte behavior and neural protection during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may delay the pericyte response but not necessarily attenuate it, and should be associated with hypothermic protection </plain></SENT>
