<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is one of major complications of cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a current American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) guideline states that carotid endarterectomy is probably recommended before or concomitant to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, there is no report that analyzed optimal strategies in cardiac surgery for patients with total occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this preliminary study was aimed to clarify whether preoperative blood flow measurements and prophylactic superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis could reduce the incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during cardiac surgery in patients with total occlusion of the ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included eight patients who were admitted to undergo cardiac surgery including CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had total ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion on preoperative magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative cerebral blood flow and its reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were quantitatively determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative blood flow measurements revealed that two (25%) of eight patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral hemodynamics because of well-developed collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They safely underwent cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a marked impairment of cerebral perfusion reserve was identified in six (75%) of eight patients in the ipsilateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, four patients underwent prophylactic STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis prior to CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, they safely underwent CABG without perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report suggesting that preoperative identification of hemodynamic compromise and prophylactic STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis may reduce perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during cardiac surgery in patients with ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, although further studies are needed to assess the validity </plain></SENT>
