<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of cornin, an iridoid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi>, in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion (I/R), and to elucidate the potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 1 h, then reperfusion for 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and histopathological damage were assessed to evaluate the brain pathophysiological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectrophotometric assay methods were used to determine the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-peroxidase (GPx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as respiratory control ratio and respiratory enzymes of the brain mitochondria were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that cornin significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, and reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and degenerative neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, cornin significantly increased the brain ATP content, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism, inhibited the elevation of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content and ROS generation, and attenuated the decrease of SOD and GPx activities in brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that cornin has protective potential against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury and its protective effects may be due to amelioration of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property </plain></SENT>
