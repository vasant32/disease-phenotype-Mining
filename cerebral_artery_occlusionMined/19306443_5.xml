<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To validate (23)Na twisted projection magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a quantitative technique to assess local brain <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br)) during rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> every 5.3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MRI protocol included an ultrashort echo-time (0.4 msec), a correction of radiofrequency (RF) inhomogeneities by B(1) mapping, and the use of 0-154 mM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> calibration standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare MRI [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) values with those obtained by emission flame photometry in precision-punched brain samples of about 0.5 mm(3) size, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were aligned with a histological three-dimensional reconstruction of the punched brain and regions of interest (ROIs) were placed precisely over the punch voids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Bland-Altman analysis of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic cortex and caudate putamen of seven rats quantitated by (23)Na MRI and flame photometry yielded a mean bias and limits of agreement (at +/-1.96 SD) of 2% and 43% of average, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A linear increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) was observed between 1 and 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (23)Na MRI provides accurate and reliable results within the whole range of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with a temporal resolution of 5.3 minutes and precisely targeted submicroliter ROIs in selected brain structures </plain></SENT>
