<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An animal model of selective middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion is needed for evaluation of intra-arterial (IA) delivery of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a technique for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> thrombo-occlusion in the rabbit with real-time angiographic documentation of occlusion and thrombolytic recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After femoral artery cutdown, a microcatheter was advanced from the internal carotid artery to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was achieved by IA thrombin and reperfusion by IA plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The terminal internal carotid artery was successfully catheterized in 12 of 13 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stable (2-hour) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was induced and verified angiographically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 animals; 2 animals also had distal internal carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was achieved rapidly after IA plasmin in 3 of 3 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new animal model of selective <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion documented by real-time angiography and used to demonstrate recanalization with IA plasmin </plain></SENT>
