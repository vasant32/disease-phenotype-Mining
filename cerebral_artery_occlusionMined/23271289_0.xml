<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of G-CSF in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat model with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolism disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty male SD rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet control group (NC group) and high-fat diet group (HFD group) (n = 40 in each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In HFD group, rats were fed on high fat diet to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 29 days, 4 rats from each group were sacrificed to evaluate the effects of different diets, and the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in the rest of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO rats received either G-CSF (50 μg·kg(-1)·mL(-1)) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection through the external jugular vein for 5 days, which was followed by 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-deoxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> (BrdU, i.p., 50 mg/kg) injection for another 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects of G-CSF treatment on neurological function, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vascular distribution, ischemic cells proliferation, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured to determine the effects of G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that G-CSF-treated rats had a lower mNSS than PBS-treated rats in both NC group and HFD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-CSF injection promoted endothelial cell proliferation and vascular regeneration, and inhibited cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serum and tissue levels of VEGF were significantly increased after G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that G-CSF exerts its neuroprotective effect in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> by enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, promoting cells proliferation, decreasing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and increasing local VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
