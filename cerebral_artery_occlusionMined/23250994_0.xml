<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook preclinical investigations of a novel therapeutic approach involving supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi>, an endogenous pleiotropic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> treatment was evaluated in rat models of permanent or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies used primary neuronal/astrocytic cultures and ex vivo brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intravenous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> exhibited robust cerebroprotection in a dose-dependent manner, with long clinically relevant therapeutic time windows of 6 hours and 9 hours in transient and permanent models, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological outcomes and functional improvements including motor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> were sustained on 14th day poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In safety and tolerability assessments, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> did not exhibit any evidence of adverse effects or toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, histological evaluation of organs, complete blood count, coagulation tests, and the serum chemistry did not reveal any abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary neuronal cell cultures and ex vivo brain homogenates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> exhibited robust antiexcitotoxic, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, and mitochondria protecting activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both permanent and transient ischemic models, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> treatment exhibited significant cerebroprotection against histological and functional damage, with wide therapeutic and clinically relevant time windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">Carnosine</z:chebi> was well tolerated and exhibited no toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic data show that it influences multiple deleterious processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that this endogenous pleiotropic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> is a strong candidate for further development as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
