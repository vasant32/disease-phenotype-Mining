<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some earlier studies indicated that NPY may have neuroprotective effect; however, the results obtained so far are still divergent, and the role of different Y receptors remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore in the presented study we investigated the neuroprotective potential of NPY and its Y2, Y5 or Y1 receptor (R) ligands against the kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity in neuronal cultures in vitro, as well as in vivo after intrahippocampal KA injection and also in an ischemic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model after intraventricular injection of Y2R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPY compounds were applicated 30 min, 1, 3 or 6 h after the start of the exposure to KA, or 30 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the neuroprotective activity of NPY and its Y2R and Y5R ligands against the kainate-induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical and hippocampal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, NPY was effective when given as late as 6 h, while Y2R or Y5R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> 3 h, after starting the exposure to KA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies those protective effects were inhibited by the respective receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was also observed in vivo after intrahippocampal injection of Y2R and Y5R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> 30 min or 1 h after KA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No protection was found either in vitro or in vivo after the Y1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Y2R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> also showed neuroprotective activity in the ischemic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The obtained results indicate that neuropeptide Y produces neuroprotective effect via Y2 and Y5 receptors, and that the compounds may be effective after delayed application </plain></SENT>
