<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate early patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> changes in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using the first pass of two magnetic susceptibility contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hours after endovascular middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were examined in an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After bolus application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> and, 10 minutes later, of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> particles, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> changes of the first pass of these contrast agents were followed using a T2*-weighted fast low-angle shot sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time-density curves of both contrast agents were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After bolus injection of either (paramagnetic) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> or superparamagnetic particles, nonischemic brain parenchyma decreased markedly in signal, whereas the ischemic brain area remained relatively hyperintense (and thus became clearly delineated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only after application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> did a mild reduction in signal occur in the ischemic hemisphere, although the main artery was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An explantation for this phenomenon might be residual capillary perfusion (plasma flow), which is detectable only when the smaller (paramagnetic) contrast molecules are being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral perfusion deficits can be detected 1 hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with T2*-weighted fast low-angle shot sequences and bolus injection of paramagnetic or superparamagnetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">Gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> may be used as a marker of microcirculatory plasma flow </plain></SENT>
