<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to exercise on a treadmill for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion was administered to exercised and nonexercised animals to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exercised ischemic rats were subjected to TNF-alpha inhibition and ERK1/2 by TNF-alpha antibody or UO126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining of coronal sections revealed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evans blue extravasation and water content evaluated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot was performed to analyze protein expression of TNF-alpha, ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, the basal laminar protein collagen IV, and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activity of MMP-9 was determined by gelatin zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were upregulated during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and Evans blue extravasation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly decreased in exercised ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collagen IV production increased in exercised rats and remained high after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas MMP-9 protein level and activity decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results were negated and returned toward nonexercised values once TNF-alpha or ERK1/2 was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that preischemic, exercise-induced TNF-alpha markedly decreases <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction by using the ERK1/2 pathway </plain></SENT>
