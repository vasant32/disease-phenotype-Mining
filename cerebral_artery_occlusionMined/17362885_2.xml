<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied ischemic tolerance induced by the serine protease thrombin in two different models of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we demonstrate that incubation with low doses of thrombin protects neurons against a subsequent severe oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L-JNKI1, a highly specific c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, and a second specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, prevented thrombin preconditioning (TPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that the exposure to thrombin increases the level of phosphorylated c-jun, the major substrate of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TPC, in vivo, leads to significantly smaller lesion sizes after a 30-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and the preconditioned mice were better off in the three tests used to evaluate functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance with in vitro results, TPC in vivo was prevented by administration of L-JNKI1, supporting a role for JNK in TPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results, from two different TPC models and with two distinct JNK inhibitors, show that JNK is likely to be involved in TPC </plain></SENT>
