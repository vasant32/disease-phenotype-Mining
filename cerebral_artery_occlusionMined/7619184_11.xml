<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains a complex pathophysiologic process that is poorly understood and difficult to investigate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary animal model used to study this phenomenon is that of unilateral carotid artery ligation with 2-3 hours exposure to severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new model of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was developed based on transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this model a #6-0 (0.07 mm) nylon filament is passed via the carotid artery to occlude reversibly the middle cerebral artery for 4 hours under conditions of normoxia in 14- to 18-day-old spontaneously hypertensive rat pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After removal of the filament and reperfusion for 24 hours, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> stain, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, a neocortical and caudoputamenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> affecting 49% of hemispheric volume that measured 180 +/- 29 mm3 (hemisphere volume = 359 +/- 16 mm3, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was created in 90% of animals (n = 8) undergoing this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This model has the advantage of being relatively noninvasive, of not requiring global exposure of brain to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and of using temporary rather than permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique should improve the ability to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term pathophysiology of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly the phenomenon of reperfusion injury, as well as its sequelae in the developing <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
