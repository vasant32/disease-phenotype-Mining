<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have shown that N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic mechanisms have independent excitatory effects on bladder activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats under <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51065">dopamine receptor agonist</z:chebi>, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48561">dopamine receptor antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain </plain></SENT>
