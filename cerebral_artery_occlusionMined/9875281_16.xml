<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used a combination of histological and immunocytochemical methods to evaluate cell responses from 30 min to 48 h after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific immunocytochemical markers clearly revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> early responses in neurons (neurofilament protein 200), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and microglia/macrophages (OX-42 and ED-1) such as enlarged, convoluted neuronal processes, and disintegration of glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive topographic changes in the developing lesion, pinpointed by immunolabeling, indicated the severity and extension of the cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astrocytes and microglia around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and contralaterally, occurred 24-48 h after MCAO and coincided with mass <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations corroborate the suggestion that the inflammatory process is involved in the progression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
