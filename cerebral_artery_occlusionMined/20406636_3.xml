<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work demonstrated that young male mice had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation after an induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than aging animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation is the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of NKCC in young (10-12 weeks) and aging (15-16 months) C57BL6 male mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of NKCC with Bumetanide on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting analysis showed that NKCC expression was significantly higher in the ischemic penumbra of young compared to aging mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> formation was significantly more robust in young mice and was reduced with Bumetanide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bumetanide had no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in aging mice after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that NKCC expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation are age dependent after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
