<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> increases beta-amyloid (Abeta) production by increasing beta-secretase (BACE1) through activation of caspase-3, and stimulates generation of mutant ubiquitin (UBB(+1)) in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether caspase-3 activation participates in the regulation of UBB(+1) generation and UBB(+1)-mediated BACE1 stability in ischemic injured brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that UBB(+1) and activated caspase-3-immunopositive-stained cells were time dependently increased in the ipsilateral striatum of rat brains after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UBB(+1)-immunopositive cells could be co-stained with caspase-3, Abeta (UBB(+1)-Abeta), and BACE1 (UBB(+1)-BACE1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BACE1 protein could also be pulled down by immunoprecipitation with UBB(+1) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Z-DEVD-FMK (DEVD), a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly decreased the level of UBB(+1) protein and the number of UBB(+1)-Abeta and UBB(+1)-BACE1 double-stained cells in the ischemic striatum, as well as the level of UBB(+1)/BACE1 protein complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that activation of caspase-3 might be upstream of UBB(+1) formation and that excessive UBB(+1) could bind to BACE1 and increase the stability of BACE1, thereby increasing Abeta in ischemic injured brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest new biological and pathological effects of caspases and regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide new therapeutic targets to prevent further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
