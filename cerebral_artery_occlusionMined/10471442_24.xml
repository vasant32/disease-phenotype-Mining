<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> has been suggested to be the most potent therapeutic approach to reduce experimental ischemic brain injury identified to date, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is increasingly used for neuroprotection during neurovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that combined administration of tirilazad mesylate and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> provides for an overall enhanced neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether the efficacy of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) can be increased by combination pharmacotherapy with tirilazad and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (MgCl(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms (n=10 each): (1) normothermia+vehicle, (2) normothermia+tirilazad+MgCl(2), (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>+vehicle, or (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>+tirilazad+MgCl(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was monitored by a bilateral laser-Doppler flowmeter, and the electroencephalogram was continuously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were quantified by daily neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tirilazad+MgCl(2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>+tirilazad+MgCl(2) reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 56%, 63%, and 77%, respectively, relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and combination pharmacotherapy, cortical infarction was almost completely abolished (-99%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the basal ganglia was significantly reduced by 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, this treatment provided for the best electrophysiological recovery and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> can be increased by pharmacological antagonism of excitatory amino acids and free radicals by using clinically available drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This treatment strategy could be of great benefit when applied during temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
