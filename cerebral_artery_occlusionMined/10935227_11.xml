<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, therefore, we gave Ginkgo extract to rats with per os digestion, and investigated its effect on CBF and ischemic brain damage with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment with Ginkgo extract (10 mg 100 g-1 rat) increased CBF in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition, but the degree of increase in CBF was lesser during and after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TTC staining showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced with Ginkgo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL and HSP72 immunostaining confirmed the protective effect of Ginkgo treatment reducing numbers of TUNEL and HSP72 positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that caspase-3 expression was less abundant in Ginkgo treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that Ginkgo extract contains a substance which increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF and reduces ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
