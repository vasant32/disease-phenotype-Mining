<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified proteins that were differentially expressed by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment during ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to MCAO and brains were collected at 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins derived from the cerebral cortex were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein spots with a greater than 2.5-fold change in intensity were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these proteins, gamma-enolase, stathmin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>, peroxiredoxin-6, hippocalcin, protein phosphatase 2A, adenosylhomocysteinase, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha were significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated group in comparison to the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identified proteins consist of cell differentiation and stabilization proteins, as well as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dehydroprimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2), a target of protein oxidation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, was significantly increased in vehicle-treated animals, while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced increase of DRP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results of this study suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting from ischemic brain injury and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by both the up- and down-regulation of various proteins </plain></SENT>
