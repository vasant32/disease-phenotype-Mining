<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Nogo-A protein is an important inhibitor of axonal remodeling after central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injuries, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interfering with the function of Nogo-A via infusion of a therapeutic anti-Nogo-A antibody after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases neuronal remodeling and enhances functional recovery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe the regional distribution of cortical neurons expressing Nogo-A in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and post-MCAO neuronal Nogo-A expression were described via immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> brains were processed for Nogo-A and parvalbumin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of Nogo-A expression was scored for each cortical area or white matter structure of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and fluorescent intensity of layer V neurons in contralesional sensorimotor forelimb cortex were also assessed at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nogo-A expression was observed in both cortical pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-positive interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuronal expression of Nogo-A changed over time in ipsilesional and contralesional cortical areas after MCAO, becoming globally elevated at 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nogo-A expression was not observed to fluctuate greatly in the white matter after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with the exception of a transient increase in Nogo-A expression in the external capsule near the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal Nogo-A expression is significantly increased at 28 days post-MCAO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of their robust expression of Nogo-A after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons represent potential targets for anti-Nogo-A therapies in the poststroke cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
