<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, a rat model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 h was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with results in the noninsulted hemisphere, there was a significant increase in P-Tyr immunolabeling of the microglia in the insulted cerebral cortex 3 h postreperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This microglial reaction progressed up to 24 h after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the affected cerebral cortex, morphological changes of the microglial positive for P-Tyr were also observed, with shortened and thickened processes, enlarged cell bodies, and ameboid features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell density analysis did not show any apparent change in number of P-Tyr-positive microglia in the insulted cortex at 6, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion, suggesting that the cells with increased P-Tyr immunoreactivity were resident microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that signal transduction mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the microglial response to ischemic injury in the rat cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
