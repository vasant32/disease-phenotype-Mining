<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Netrin-1 (NT-1) stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro and promotes focal neovascularization in the adult brain in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This in vivo study in mice investigated the effect of NT-1 hyperexpression on focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and long-term functional outcome after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors carrying either the NT-1 gene (AAV-NT-1) or GFP (AAV-GFP) were generated and injected into the brains of separate groups of 93 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, tMCAO followed by 7-28 days of reperfusion were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological outcomes and behavioral deficits were quantified 7-28 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small cerebral vessel network and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> were assessed 28 days after tMCAO, using synchrotron radiation microangiography and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed that on the day of tMCAO, NT-1 hyperexpression had been achieved in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence imaging showed that NT-1 expression was primarily in neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced infarction in the NT-1 hyperexpression group was attenuated in comparison to saline or AAV-GFP-treated groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, neurological deficits were greatly improved in AAV-NT-1-treated mice compared with mice in saline or AAV-GFP-treated groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was increased in AAV-NT-1-treated mice compared with the other 2 groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vivo synchrotron radiation microangiography 28 days after tMCAO revealed more branches in AAV-NT-1-treated mice than in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AAV-NT-1 induced NT-1 hyperexpression before tMCAO reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, enhanced neovascularization, and improved long-term functional recovery </plain></SENT>
