<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of CA1 hippocampal neurones following 5 min bilateral occlusion of the carotid artery (BCAO) in the gerbil was almost completely prevented by LY379268 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) given 30 min post-occlusion (P &lt; 0.001); 10 mg/kg 1 h after and 20 mg/kg 2 h after BCAO also produced significant neuroprotection (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly the BCAO-induced increase in TUNEL positive cells at 5 days post-occlusion was reduced by LY379268 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced by endothelin-1 infusion in the rat was unaffected by either 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p. of LY379268 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This contrast between the results from these two animal models with LY379268, agrees with previous data on a less potent but similarly selective mGluR2/3 agonist, LY354740 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It further suggests that mGluR Group II <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are likely to have more utility in global, than in focal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
