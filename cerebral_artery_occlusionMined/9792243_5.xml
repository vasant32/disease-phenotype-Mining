<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to explore whether or not this secondary deterioration is due to secondary microcirculatory compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> fasted rats were subjected to 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and allowed reperfusion for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At predetermined reperfusion times, rats were injected with Evans blue and decapitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Capillary patency was determined using a fluorescent double-staining technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No capillary perfusion deficits were detected in the ischemic neocortical penumbra, neocortical focus or striatal focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the secondary deterioration of bioenergetic state is not due to microcirculatory compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since hyperglycemic animals show pan-necrotic lesions, a hyperglycemic group was added at 8 h of reperfusion to test if the adverse effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on ischemic damage is related to capillary compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that, in hyperglycemic rats, capillary perfusion in the striatal focus was compromised after 8 h of recirculation following 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that when normoglycemic rats are subjected to 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, capillary patency is not affected during the first 4-6 h of reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 8 h of reflow, though, particularly in hyperglycemic rats, microcirculation is compromised in the caudoputamenal focus, probably reflecting infarction </plain></SENT>
