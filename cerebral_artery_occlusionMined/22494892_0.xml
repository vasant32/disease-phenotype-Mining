<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) can be a devastating complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) has been shown to improve blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine whether HBO-PC attenuates HT after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and to investigate whether the mechanism of HBO-PC against HT includes up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-320 g) were divided into the following groups: sham, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h, and MCAO treated with HBO-PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC was conducted giving 100% oxygen at 2.5 atm absolute (ATA), for 1 h at every 24 h interval for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after the last session of HBO-PC, rats received an injection of 50% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (6 ml/kg intraperitoneally) and were subjected to MCAO 15 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after MCAO, neurological behavior tests, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content were measured to evaluate the effect of HBO-PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was evaluated at multiple time-points before and after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HBO-PC improved neurological behavior test, and reduced infarction volume, HT and Evans blue extravasation in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis failed to demonstrate up-regulation of Nrf2 in HBO-PC group before and after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, HBO-PC decreased HO-1 expression at 24 h after MCAO, as compared with htMCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HBO-PC improved neurological deficits, infarction volume, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, and HT after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, its mechanism against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and HT may not include activation of Nrf2 and subsequent HO-1 expression </plain></SENT>
