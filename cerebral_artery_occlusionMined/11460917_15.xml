<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the brains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> patients, beta amyloid protein is the major component of senile plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In ischemic stress, beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> are reported to be upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Using Male Wistar-ST rats, expression and distribution of APP and beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were examined immunohistochemically after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> induced by a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion for 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days, brains were removed and immunostaining was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The reactive astrocytes with APP were observed in the periphery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> from 3 days to 60 days post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was also localized in the reactive astrocytes in the peripheral zone of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 7, 14, and 30 days post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, beta amyloid expression was not identified at 3 days or 60 days post MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> temporarily induced beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> expression in reactive astrocytes, but this expression peaked at 30 days and disappeared at 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings suggested that beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was derived from the processing of APP produced in the same reactive astrocytes and the production of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> stopped within 60 days after the ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
