<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats failed to solve the 8-arm radial maze task (cognitively impaired rats), while 11 MCA-occluded rats could complete it (cognitively unimpaired rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When a delay of 60 min was imposed in the task, however, 5 cognitively unimpaired rats failed to complete the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats that underwent behavioral testing were studied for any changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> levels in various brain regions using HPLC with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> levels in the infarcted areas decreased considerably in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats, but no region of the infarcted areas correlated with the spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> levels tended to decrease in the frontal cortex of the cognitively impaired rats and greatly increased in both ipsilateral and contralateral parietal cortex of the cognitively unimpaired rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> levels and spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> in the contralateral frontal cortex, and ipsilateral and contralateral parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the cholinergic function of the frontal and parietal cortices might play a role in acquiring spatial cognition in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
