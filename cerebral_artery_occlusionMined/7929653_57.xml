<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies indicate that protein p53 is a major determinant of the cellular mechanism that leads to programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> C57 mice and two groups of transgenic C57 mice, one homozygous and the other heterozygous for a p53 null gene, were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As expected, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice had a large, consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (22.11 +/- 4.59 mm3; n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both transgenic groups had significantly less ischemic damage than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unexpectedly, the heterozygous group had the least amount of ischemic damage (16.12 +/- 1.71 mm3, n = 11; 27% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ischemic damage in the homozygous group (18.72 +/- 3.48 mm3, n = 9) was significantly less than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control (15% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size) but significantly more than in the heterozygous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the absence of p53 expression was protective, greater protection was afforded by reduced expression of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that attenuated p53 expression may be protective after an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
