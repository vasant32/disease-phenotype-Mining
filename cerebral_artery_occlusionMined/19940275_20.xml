<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of postischemic administration of FTY720 in rats with 2 hours transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eleven male rats were randomly assigned to sham-operated and MCAO treated with vehicle, 0.25 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of FTY720, another selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi> receptor-1 agonist SEW2871 (5 mg/kg), or 0.25 mg/kg of FTY720 plus a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, VPC23019 (0.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drugs were injected intraperitoneally immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological score and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed at 24 and 72 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling were conducted at 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FTY720 significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological score at 24 and 72 hours after MCAO compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SEW2871 showed similar neuroprotective effects to FTY720, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> 20319 abolished the neuroprotective effects of FTY720 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FTY720 significantly retained Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression and decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling-positive neurons at 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VPC23019 blocked the antiapoptotic effects of FTY720 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi>-1 by FTY720 reduces neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
