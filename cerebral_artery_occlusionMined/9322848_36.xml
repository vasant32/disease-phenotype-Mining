<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the effect of delayed high-concentration albumin therapy on ischemic injury in a highly reproducible model of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 270 to 320 g were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 120 minutes of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion induced by means of a poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal nylon suture inserted retrograde via the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The agent (20% human serum albumin [HSA]) or control solution (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> 0.9%) was administered intravenously at a dosage of 1% of body weight immediately after suture removal following a 2-hour period of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals' neurological status was evaluated during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (at 60 minutes) and daily for 3 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HSA significantly improved the neurological score compared with saline at 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats treated with HSA also had significantly reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by 34%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (by 81%) compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between hematocrit level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01), and between total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and neurological score at 24, 48, and 72 hours postinjury (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results strongly support the beneficial effect of delayed albumin therapy in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and indicate its possible usefulness in treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
