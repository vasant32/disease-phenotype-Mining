<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although both microsomal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E synthase (mPGES)-1 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 are critical factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury, but the interactions between these enzymes in the ischaemic brain is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the hypothesis that mPGES-1 activity is required for COX-2 to cause neuronal damage in ischaemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity model in cultures of rat or mouse hippocampal slices and a mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-reperfusion model in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on neuronal damage in mPGES-1 knockout (KO) mice was compared with that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: In rat hippocampal slices, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity, as well as <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E(2) production and PGES activation, was significantly attenuated by either MK-886 or NS-398, inhibitors of mPGES-1 and COX-2 respectively; however, co-application of these inhibitors had neither an additive nor a synergistic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of NS-398 on the excitotoxicity observed in WT slices was completely abolished in mPGES-1 KO slices, which showed less excitotoxicity than WT slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> model, mPGES-1 and COX-2 were co-localized in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Injection of NS-398 reduced not only ischaemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production, but also ischaemic injuries in WT mice, but not in mPGES-1 KO mice, which showed less dysfunction than WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Microsomal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E synthase-1 and COX-2 are co-induced by excess <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in ischaemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are co-localized and act together to exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury, by excessive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production </plain></SENT>
