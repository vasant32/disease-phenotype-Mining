<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that FK506 treatment could protect rat brain from oxidative injuries through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory pathways after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 minutes, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received a single injection of FK506 (0·3 mg/kg) or vehicle intravenously at 30 minutes after ischemic induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological performance were evaluated at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> (4-HNE), 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were conducted at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FK506 significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (61·7%; P=0·01) and improved neurological deficit scores (P&lt;0·05) 24 hours after reperfusion compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In FK506-treated rats, accumulation of 4-HNE (P&lt;0·01) and 8-OHdG (P&lt;0·01) was significantly suppressed in the cerebral cortex 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, FK506 markedly reduced microglial activation (P&lt;0·01) and TNF-alpha expression (P&lt;0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that FK506 may have <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> as well as anti-inflammatory effects and reduces ischemic damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
