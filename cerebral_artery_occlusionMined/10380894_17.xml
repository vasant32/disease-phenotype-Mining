<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) was observed in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models where infiltrated leukocytes were supposed to induce tissue injury, however, the protein level and time course of these chemokines have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the time-dependent production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and CINC in the rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by means of specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels in the ipsilateral hemispheres increased from 6 h, peaked at 2 days, and thereafter gradually decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 concentration was 89.2+/-28.2 ng/g tissue wet weight (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, n = 5, 49.3-fold greater than the contralateral value at the same time, P &lt; 0.05), which is supposed to be high enough to exert its biological effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the maximum CINC concentration that corresponded to 2.9+/-0.7 ng/g tissue wet weight (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, n = 5, 55.0-fold greater than the contralateral value at the same time, P &lt; 0.05), was observed at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we confirmed the temporal profile of leukocyte subtypes that infiltrated into the ischemic brain, thus, neutrophil infiltration occurred at early stages (1-3 days), followed by massive infiltration of macrophages at later stages (2-7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> actually plays a significant role in the migration of macrophages into the lesion and that the differential temporal production of these chemokines contributes to the regulation of infiltrated leukocyte subtypes </plain></SENT>
