<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that intravenous infusion of bone marrow derived-marrow stromal cells (MSCs) enter the brain and reduce neurological functional deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats (n=32) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Test groups consisted of MCAO alone (group 1, n=6); intravenous infusion of 1x10(6) MSCs at 24 hours after MCAO (group 2, n=6); or infusion of 3x10(6) MSCs (group 3, n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in groups 1 to 3 were euthanized at 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 4 consisted of MCAO alone (n=6) and group 5, intravenous infusion of 3x10(6) MSCs at 7 days after MCAO (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in groups 4 and 5 were euthanized at 35 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For cellular identification, MSCs were prelabeled with bromodeoxyuridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (rotarod, adhesive-removal, and modified Neurological Severity Score [NSS]) were performed before and at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify MSCs or cells derived from MSCs in brain and other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Significant recovery of somatosensory behavior and Neurological Severity Score (P&lt;0.05) were found in animals infused with 3x10(6) MSCs at 1 day or 7 days compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSCs survive and are localized to the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere, and a few cells express protein marker phenotypic neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MSCs delivered to ischemic brain tissue through an intravenous route provide therapeutic benefit after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MSCs may provide a powerful autoplastic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
