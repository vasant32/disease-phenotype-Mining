<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FK506 binds to intracellular proteins (FKBP) which have a wide range of functions but have in common the peptidyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> cis/trans isomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we have analyzed the expression of FKBP12, 52 and 65 and the total FKBP enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of FK506 on signal transduction in neurons and perfusion changes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male rats the expression of FKBP12, 52 and 65 was analyzed by Western blot in FK506-treated and control animals and the peptidyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> cis/trans isomerase activity was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure tissue perfusion, development of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the neuronal stress signal cascade, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), Fas-ligand (Fas-L) and c-Jun expression and phosphorylation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FK506 decreased the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 53% and reduced the cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total FKBP enzymatic activity in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was increased and blocked dose dependently by FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FKBP expression was selectively up-regulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FK506 treatment does not influence the expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>c-Jun phosphorylation in neurons of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and Fas-L expression was reduced by FK506 treatment whereas ATF-2 expression was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic damage to the brain was reduced by FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was shown for the first time that neuroprotection by FK506 also included the suppression of the cerebral peptidyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> cis/trans isomerase activity of FKBP in vivo whereas the expression levels of FKBP12, 52 and 65 following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> changed slightly and FK506 treatment does not suppress the expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, changes of FKBP enzymatic activity result in suppression of the stress cell body response in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as observed by suppression of c-Jun phosphorylation and Fas-L expression </plain></SENT>
