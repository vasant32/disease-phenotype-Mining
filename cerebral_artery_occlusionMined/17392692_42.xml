<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although immune elements clearly are activated after brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, the relative contribution of T and B lymphocytes to the developing lesion has not been quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated effects 22 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (90 mins) on histologic injury and peripheral immune activation in severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice lacking T and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were strikingly reduced in male <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice (n=14, 33+/-4% of contralateral cortex, n=10, 52+/-3% of contralateral hemisphere) versus immunologically intact C57BL/6 mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, n=9, 57+/-5% of contralateral cortex, 57+/-4% of contralateral hemisphere) (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Striatal infarction was not altered (77+/-7% of contralateral striatum in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>, 84+/-7% in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>), suggesting that the core of the evolving ischemic lesion was not impacted by lack of T and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, inflammatory factors from immune cells in ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> brains were essentially absent, with the exception of interleukin-1beta increase in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spleen cell numbers were low in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice, but were further reduced 22 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with substantial reduction in most inflammatory factors except for increased expression of interferon-gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data quantify the damaging effect of T and B lymphocytes on early, evolving ischemic brain injury, and further implicate interleukin-1beta in brain and interferon-gamma and MIP-2 in spleen as inflammatory factors produced by cells other than T and B cells </plain></SENT>
