<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Robust <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-stimulated neurogenesis implies the existence of an innate response and rehabilitation mechanism to injury repair, i.e. cognitive recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether unpredictable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild stress (CMS) influences <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-stimulated compensatory neurogenesis in the hippocampus and also studied the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were exposed to the CMS paradigm after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The open-field test (OFT) and the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption test were employed to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival and fate of proliferating cells was monitored by labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and other cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was examined 1 day after the last BrdU injection, and survival and differentiation were determined up to 45 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of BrdU-positive cells that were labelled using the 2 protocols and the proportion of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) ipsilateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were higher than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CMS induced depressive behaviours in ischemic rats, and this was accompanied by reduced proliferation and survival/neurogenic fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these effects were reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support a putative role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis in what may be an adaptive or compensatory process, which is influenced by post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) and thus represents a potential target for therapy </plain></SENT>
