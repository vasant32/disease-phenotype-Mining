<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the neurogenerative effect of G-CSF has been intensely investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the possibility that G-CSF enhanced the cell proliferation in the rat dentate gyrus (DG) after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, using a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 7 days after tMCAO, the number of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the G-CSF-treated group was significantly increased compared with that in the vehicle-treated group in the ipsilateral SGZ (16.6+/-5.5/mm(2) in the vehicle-treated group versus 33.0+/-7.2/mm(2) in the G-CSF-treated group, **p&lt;0.01) and in the ipsilateral GCL (14.2+/-2.8/mm(2) in the vehicle-treated group versus 21.0+/-3.8/mm(2) in the G-CSF-treated group, *p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result showed the possibility of a neurogenerative role of G-CSF after tMCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
