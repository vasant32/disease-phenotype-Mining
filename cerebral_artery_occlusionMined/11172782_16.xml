<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are many examples of compounds showing neuroprotective efficacy in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but not in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these compounds possess poor therapeutic ratios, which results in the administration of sub-efficacious doses in order to avoid the emergence of side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to explore this possibility, this study compared the therapeutic ratios of a number of neuroprotective agents that have undergone clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective efficacy was established using the mouse permanent (24 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Side-effect liability was determined by assessment of motor coordination using the rotarod test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic ratio was calculated as the ratio between the minimum effective dose (MED) for significant impairment in rotarod performance and the MED for significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compounds were administered i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>30 min prior to rotarod testing or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drugs such as Ifenprodil, Cerestat and Selfotel, that have failed in clinical trials, were found to have very low therapeutic ratios of &lt; or = 1, whereas compounds with more tolerable clinical side-effect profiles were found to have higher therapeutic ratios (2, 10 and 10 for Sipatrigine, Remacemide and sPBN, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the lack of efficacy of a number of neuroprotectants in clinical trials may well be a consequence of their poor therapeutic ratios </plain></SENT>
