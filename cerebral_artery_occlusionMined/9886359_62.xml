<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study has ascertained the cellular localization and chronologic and topographic distribution of pro/mature interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) protein 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by subjecting rats to permanent unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1beta was localized immunocytochemically in vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells that expressed IL-1beta had the morphologic features of microglia and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1beta was first detected 1 hour after occlusion in ipsilateral meningeal macrophage-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 6 hours, pro/mature IL-1beta-immunoreactive (IL-1(beta)ir) putative microglia were present in the ischemic cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, caudoputamen, and surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 24 and 48 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the number and spread of IL-1(beta)ir cells increased greatly, including those resembling activated microglia and macrophages, as the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> became infiltrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1(beta)ir cells also were present in apparently undamaged tissue, adjacent to the lesion ipsilaterally, and contralaterally in the cerebral cortex, dorsal corpus callosum, dorsal caudoputamen, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the functional role of IL-1 in ischemic brain damage and reveal a distinct temporal and spatial expression of IL-1beta protein in cells believed to be microglia and macrophages </plain></SENT>
