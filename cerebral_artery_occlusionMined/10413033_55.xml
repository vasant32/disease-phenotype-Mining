<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent results have demonstrated that the spin trapping agent alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> nitrone (PBN) reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, even when given 1 to 3 hours after the start of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors assessed the effect of NXY-059, a novel nitrone that is more soluble than PBN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loading doses were given of 0.30, 3.0, or 30 mg x kg(-1) followed by 0.30, 3.0, or 30 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 24 or 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-response studies showed that when treatment was begun 1 hour after recirculation, 0.30 mg x kg(-1) had a small and 30 mg x kg(-1) a marked effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At equimolar doses (3.0 mg x kg(-1) for NXY-059 and 1.4 mg x kg(-1) for PBN), NXY-059 was more efficacious than PBN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when a recovery period of 7 days was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The window of therapeutic opportunity for NXY-059 was 3 to 6 hours after the start of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies of the transfer constant of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]NXY-059 showed that, in contrast to PBN, this more soluble nitrone penetrates the blood-brain barrier less extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This fact, and the pronounced antiischemic effect of NXY-059, suggest that the delayed events leading to infarction may be influenced by reactions occurring at the blood-endothelial interface </plain></SENT>
