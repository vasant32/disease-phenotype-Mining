<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The levels of protein kinase C-gamma (PKC-gamma ) and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-alpha (CaMKII-alpha) were measured in crude synaptosomal (P2), particulate (P3), and cytosolic (S3) fractions of the neocortex of rats exposed to 1-hour and 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 2-hour MCAO followed by 2-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During MCAO, PKC levels increased in P2 and P3 in the most severe ischemic areas concomitantly with a decrease in S3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra, PKCgamma decreased in S3 without any significant increases in P2 and P3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total PKC-gamma also decreased in the penumbra but not in the ischemic core, suggesting that the protein is degraded by an energy-dependent mechanism, possibly by the 26S proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CaMKII-alpha levels increased in P2 but not P3 during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischemic regions, particularly in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the levels in S3 decreased by 20% to 40% in the penumbra and by approximately 80% in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in the total levels of CaMKII-alpha during MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, PKC and CaMKII-alpha are translocated to the cell membranes, particularly synaptic membranes, where they may modulate cellular function, such as neurotransmission, and also affect cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drugs preventing PKC and/or CaMKII-alpha translocation may prove beneficial against ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
