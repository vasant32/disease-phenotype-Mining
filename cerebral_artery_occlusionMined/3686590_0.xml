<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Corticomotor evoked potentials have recently been used in experimental animals and patients as a measure of neurologic function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the fundamental electrophysiologic properties contributing to the formation of these potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define some of these properties, corticomotor evoked potentials were recorded from the contralateral hindlimb in response to transcortical stimulation in cats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These potentials were obtained hourly for 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four major identifiable components were recorded in control responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> component amplitudes were significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, after approximately 5 hours, the early latency components exceeded control values; late latency components were also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding somatosensory evoked potentials were abolished and did not return throughout the recording session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on classic neurophysiologic studies, the amplitude increment can be explained as combined activation of low-threshold brainstem facilitatory centers and/or direct activation of subcortical axonal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With further study, corticomotor evoked potentials may be a valuable adjunct to current electrophysiologic monitoring techniques, particularly with regard to defining the extent and location of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, as well as to assessing functional recovery </plain></SENT>
