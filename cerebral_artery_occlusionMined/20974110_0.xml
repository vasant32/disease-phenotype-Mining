<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have established and characterized a model of thromboembolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advantages of this model include a very low rate of spontaneous recanalization and good reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo T2* <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and postmortem assays were used for quantification of secondary brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our protocol, 12 thrombin-induced autologous blood clots are injected into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No spontaneous reperfusion occurs in the first 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, injection of rt-PA 2 or 4h thereafter leads to reperfusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, clinically important factors known to affect the extent and likelihood of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of thrombolysis also increase <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> size in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the model may serve to investigate the pathophysiology of thrombolysis-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as potential adjunctive therapies to prevent this complication </plain></SENT>
