<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of this photodynamic therapy on the non-neoplastic, adjacent brain tissue are incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied in adult Fisher rats the time-dependent (1 hour to 7 days) effects of photoactivated Photofrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our protocol was comparable to that used in the treatment of human <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural and functional changes spread from the treatment surface and from the center to the periphery to involve the entire cerebral cortex exposed under a 5 mm craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequential changes spreading from the surface to the deepest cortical layer involve first astrocytes (1 hour), then endothelial cells and, ultimately, neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> were first noted in the microvasculature after 18 hours and coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the entire area at risk occurred only after 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the photosensitizing agent crosses the intact blood-brain barrier and enters the astrocytic compartment where it becomes cytotoxic upon light activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comparison between the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> of photodynamic therapy and those induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> suggests that cell damage evolves along different paths in these two forms of brain injury </plain></SENT>
