<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the effect of duration of graded increases in serum osmolality with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and hypertonic saline (HS) on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption and regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in a well-characterized rat model of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient (2-h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by the intraluminal occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning at 6 h after MCAO, rats were treated with either no intravenous fluids or a continuous intravenous infusion (0.3 mL/h) of 0.9% saline, 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, 3% HS, or 7.5% HS for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was quantified by the Evans blue (EB) extravasation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments, water content was assessed by comparing wet-to-dry weight ratios in six predetermined brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption was maximal in rats treated with 0.9% saline for 48 h, but did not correlate with increases in serum osmolality or treatment duration with osmotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 7.5% HS attenuated water content in the periinfarct regions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subregions of the contralateral nonischemic hemisphere to a greater extent than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> did with no adverse effect on survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that (1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity is not affected by the duration and degree of serum osmolality with osmotic agents, and (2) attenuation of increases in brain water content with HS to target levels &gt;350 mOsm/L may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
