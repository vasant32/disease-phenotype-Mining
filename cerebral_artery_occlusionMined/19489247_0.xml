<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) group undergoing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with Longa's thread method, IL-10 group undergoing lateral ventricle injection of IL-10 after the establishment of I/R model, Vehicle group undergoing lateral ventricle injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline after the establishment of I/R model, and sham operation (Sham) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later the rats were killed with their brains taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of E-selectin and L-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The E-selectin and L-selectin expression levels of the I/R group were significantly up-regulated compared with the Sham group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of E-selectin and L-selectin positive vessels of the IL-10 group were 18.8 +/- 1.9/10 HP fields and 15.8 + 2.4/10 HP fields respectively, both significantly less than those of the vehicle group (24.7 +/- 2.4/10 HP fields and 20.9 + 3.3/10 HP fields respectively, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E-selectin and L-selectin gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of the IL-10 group were (0.431 +/- 0.029) and (0.318 +/- 0.048) respectively, both significantly lower than those of the Vehicle group [(0.497 +/- 0.019) and (0.433 +/- 0.087) respectively, both P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The E-selectin and L-selectin protein expression levels of the IL-10 group were (0.349 +/- 0.037) and (0.296 +/- 0.035) respectively, both significantly lower than those of the Vehicle group [(0.421 +/- 0.043,) and (0.348 +/- 0.044) respectively, both P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-10 suppresses the expression of E-selectin and L-selectin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
