<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
