<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) preconditioning-induced neuroprotection is known to be related to suppression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to determine if monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), a recently identified CCCH Zn finger-containing protein, plays a role in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and to elucidate the mechanisms of LPS-induced ischemic brain tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcription and expression of MCPIP1 gene was monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mouse microglia was prepared from cortices of C57BL/6 mouse brain and primary human microglia was acquired from Clonexpress, Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild type</z:mp> and MCPIP1 knockout mice were treated with LPS (0.2 mg/kg) 24 hours before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCPIP1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels significantly increased in both mouse and human microglia and mouse brain undergoing LPS preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCPIP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level significantly increased in mice ipsilateral brain than that of contralateral side after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality of MCPIP1 knockout mice was significantly higher than that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCPIP1 deficiency caused significant increase in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice undergoing LPS preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MCPIP1 deficiency caused significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MCPIP1 deficiency increased c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) activation substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of JNK signaling decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines in MCPIP1 knock out mice after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that absence of MCPIP1 exacerbates ischemic brain damage by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and that MCPIP1 participates in LPS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> tolerance </plain></SENT>
