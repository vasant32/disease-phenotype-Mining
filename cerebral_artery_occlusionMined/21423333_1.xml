<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using appropriate preparation methods, false negative results can be minimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats underwent a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the last imaging scan, Evans blue and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> of 4, 40, and 70 kDa molecular weight were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different histological preparation methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sites of blood-brain barrier leakage were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extravasation of Evans blue and high molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> (40 and 70 kDa) in the infarcted region could be detected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparation methods used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If exposed directly to saline, the signal intensity of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extravasation of the 4-kDa low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> could only be detected using freshly frozen tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preparations involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> resulted in the 4-kDa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> dissolving in these reactants and being washed out, giving the false negative result of no extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> represent a valuable tool to characterize altered blood-brain barrier permeability in animal models </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This pitfall needs to be known to avoid the false impression that there was no extravasation of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
