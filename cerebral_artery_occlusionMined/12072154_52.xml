<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45713">trans resveratrol</z:chebi> was evaluated in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral artery [<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>] occlusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45713">trans resveratrol</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days and were subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After two hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion reperfusion was allowed by retracting the thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were assessed for motor performance after 24 hours and subsequently rats were sacrificed for estimation of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> [malondialdehyde [<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>] and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>] and for evaluation of volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
