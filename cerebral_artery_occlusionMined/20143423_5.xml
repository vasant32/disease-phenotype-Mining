<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> can exacerbate brain and retina damage after ischemic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we made use of db/db mice with an AR null mutation (AR(-/-)db/db) to understand better the role of AR in the pathogenesis of brain and retina ischemic injuries under diabetic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral and <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> was induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in control and diabetic mice either with or without an AR null mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were evaluated for neurological deficits after 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 23.5 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the diabetic db/db mice had significantly more severe neurological deficit and larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size than the nondiabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> db/db mice, the AR(-/-)db/db mice had significantly lower neurological scores, smaller brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, and less hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> swelling was also significantly decreased in the AR(-/-)db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Less swelling in the brain and retina of the AR(-/-)db/db mice correlated with less expression of the water channel aquaporin 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data clearly show that deletion of AR leads to less severe brain and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischemic injuries in the diabetic db/db mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that inhibition of AR in diabetics may protect against damage in the brain and retina following ischemic reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
