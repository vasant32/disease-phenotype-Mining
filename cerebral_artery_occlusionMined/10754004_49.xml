<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The early ischemic lesions demonstrated by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are potentially reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to determine whether resolution of initial DWI lesions is transient or permanent after different brief periods of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and to evaluate histological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen rats were subjected to 10 minutes (n=7) or 30 minutes (n=7) of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham operation (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and T(2)-weighted imaging (T(2)WI) were performed during occlusion; immediately after reperfusion; and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the last MRI study, the brains were fixed, sectioned, stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and evaluated for neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No MRI or histological abnormalities were observed in the sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both the 10-minute and 30-minute groups, the perfusion deficits and DWI hyperintensities that occurred during occlusion disappeared shortly after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DWI, PWI, and T(2)WI results remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thereafter in the 10-minute group, whereas secondary DWI hyperintensity and T(2)WI abnormalities developed at the 12-hour observation point in the 30-minute group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations demonstrated neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in both groups, but the number of necrotic neurons was significantly higher in the 30-minute group (95+/-4%) than in the 10-minute group (17+/-10%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transient or permanent resolution of initial DWI lesions depends on the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient resolution of DWI lesions is associated with widespread neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>; moreover, permanent resolution of DWI lesions does not necessarily indicate complete salvage of brain tissue from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
