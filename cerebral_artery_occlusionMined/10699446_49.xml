<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of sensorimotor deficits in the mouse after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours after induction of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mice showed deficits in a range of sensory and motor tasks as assessed by the SHIRPA protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition they exhibited a decrease in rotarod performance and locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some behaviours, such as locomotor activity, were also impaired in sham operated animals compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, although these impairments were not as marked as those exhibited by the ischaemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first comprehensive analysis of the short term effects of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments in the rat, rates of recovery over time were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple (neurological grades, rotarod) and complex (sticky label test) tasks were examined in rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> up to 7 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic rats had a profound deficit in contralateral performance on the sticky label task with no evidence of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A less marked deficit was also observed in ipsilateral performance of this task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These deficits were still present 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic rats also exhibited a deficit on rotarod performance but this had recovered 7 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus different sensorimotor tasks have different rates of recovery after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further characterisation of these tasks will enhance their utility meaningful preclinical means of assessing functional recovery of the administration of potential neuroprotective and regenerative therapies </plain></SENT>
