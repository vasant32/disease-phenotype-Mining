<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether intravenously-infused PDA001 improves neurological functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, potential mechanisms underlying the PDA001-induced neuroprotective effect were investigated.Methods: Young adult male rats (2-3 months) were subjected to 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with PDA001 (4x10‚Å∂) or vehicle controls (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> vehicle or phosphate buffer saline (PBS)) via intravenous (IV) administration initiated at 4h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of functional tests and measurements of lesion volume and apoptotic cells were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining and ELISA assays for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were performed in the ischemic brain to test the potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of PDA001 cell treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>.Results: PDA001 cell treatment at 4h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly improved functional outcome, and as well as significantly decreased lesion volume, TUNEL and cleaved-Caspase-3 positive cell number in the ischemic brain, compared to MCAo-vehicle and MCAo-PBS control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with PDA001 cells also significantly increased HGF and VEGF expression in the ischemic border zone (IBZ) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA assays, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with PDA001 cells significantly increased VEGF, HGF and BDNF levels in the ischemic brain compared to controls.Conclusion: When administered intravenously at 4h after MCAo, PDA001 cells promoted neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects induced by PDA001 cell treatment may be related to the increase of VEGF, HGF and BDNF expression and a decrease of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PDA001 cells may provide a viable cell source to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
