<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, those studies were potentially flawed because the genotypes of tPA-/- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control mice were not entirely clear, and ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated in isolation of tPA effects on brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
