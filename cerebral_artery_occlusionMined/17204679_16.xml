<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Protein kinase C epsilon (epsilonPKC) has been implicated as a neuroprotectant in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied epsilonPKC activation (by its localization and proteolysis) in a rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and correlated the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with epsilonPKC activity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus 1 hour of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body temperatures were maintained at 37 degrees C or 30 degrees C during common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested at 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 24 hours after common carotid artery release, and the cortex corresponding to the ischemic core and penumbra was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>epsilonPKC localization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A caspase-3 inhibitor was used to test whether epsilonPKC cleavage is caspase dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: epsilonPKC in the membrane fraction and whole-protein homogenates decreased moderately in the penumbra but decreased markedly in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> blocked this decrease in both the ischemic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy confirmed that neuronal epsilonPKC expression decreased in the ischemic core at 4 hours after reperfusion, and this loss was prevented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two carboxyl-terminal cleavage products of epsilonPKC with molecular masses of 43 and 35 kDa were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the protein band of 43 kDa decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the 35-kDa band increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such changes were not dependent on caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> blocked changes in the cleavage form of 35 kDa but not 43 kDa after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> preserves epsilonPKC activity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
