<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few apoptotic cells were detected in the non-ischemic hemisphere of control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ischemic animals, scattered apoptotic cells were present in the ischemic core and clustered apoptotic cells were present and localized to the inner boundary zone of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteins were preferentially localized to the cellular cytoplasm of control rats and in the non-ischemic hemisphere of rats subjected to MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after MCAo these proteins were expressed and were preferentially localized to nuclei within the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA damage induced proteins (wt-p53 and p53-response proteins) were preferentially expressed within apoptotic cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA repair proteins and cell cycle proteins were preferentially expressed within morphologically intact cells and in reversibly damaged cells in the ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The selective expression of proteins associated with DNA damage, DNA repair and cell cycle observed in morphologically intact cells, ischemic injured cells and apoptotic cells suggests a differential role for these proteins in cell survival and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
