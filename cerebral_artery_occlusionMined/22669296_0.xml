<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Severe brain injury induced by neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causes significant mortality and disability, and effective therapies are currently lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can attenuate severe brain injury induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rat pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After confirming severe brain injury involving more than 50% of the ipsilateral hemisphere volume at 1 h after MCAO using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in postnatal day (P)10 rats, human UCB-derived MSCs were transplanted intraventricularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain MRI was evaluated periodically up to 28 d after MCAO (P38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor function and histology in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissues were evaluated at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe brain injury induced by permanent MCAO resulted in decreased survival and body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as measured by MRI, impaired functional tests such as the rotarod and cylinder test, and histologic abnormalities such as increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling, reactive microglial marker, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these abnormalities were significantly improved by MSC transplantation 6 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that human UCB-derived MSCs are a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of severe perinatal brain injury including neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
