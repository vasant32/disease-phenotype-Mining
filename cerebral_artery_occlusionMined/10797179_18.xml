<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous work by researchers in our laboratory has shown that in the rat, the exclusive use of the affected forelimb during an early critical period exaggerates lesion volume and retards functional recovery after electrolytic lesions of the forelimb sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effects of exclusive use of the affected forelimb after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> of moderate severity was produced in male Long-Evans rats through 45 minutes of occlusion of the left middle cerebral and both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusive use of either the affected or unaffected forelimb was forced through immobilization of either the ipsilateral (MCAO+ipsi) or contralateral (MCAO+contra) forelimb, respectively, for 10 days in a plaster cast, or the animal was left uncasted (MCAO+nocast) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham surgeries were performed, and animals were also casted for 10 days or left uncasted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor testing was performed during days 17 to 38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of sensorimotor testing, cognitive performance was tested with use of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, temperatures and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> levels were measured during the 10-day period after 45-minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and casting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MCAO+ipsi group performed worse on sensorimotor tasks than the MCAO+contra, MCAO+nocast, and sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly larger in the MCAO+ipsi group than in the sham and MCAO+contra groups but not in the MCAO+nocast group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No group differences were found with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, and no group differences were found in either temperature or plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The exclusive use of the affected forelimb immediately after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has detrimental effects on sensorimotor function that cannot be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> or stress </plain></SENT>
