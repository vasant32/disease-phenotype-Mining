<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-ischaemic changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> and D1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor (labelled with SCH23390) binding sites were evaluated in a rat unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The changes in binding were assessed acutely (2 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) in relation to local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) and chronically (24 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) in relation to histopathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hours following occlusion lCBF was significantly reduced throughout the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the widespread hypoperfusion, significant reductions in binding were only observed in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus--the region with the most profound reduction in blood flow (6% of the control contralateral lCBF value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> binding sites were reduced to 40% of the contralateral value while D1 binding sites were reduced to 80% of the contralateral value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> binding and CBF in the caudate nucleus revealed that the ischaemic threshold for alteration in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> binding sites 2 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was approximately 34 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four h post-occlusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> binding sites were further reduced in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus (to 6% of contralateral) while D1 binding showed minimal reduction from that observed at 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas of reduced binding corresponded to the area of histopathological change in the caudate nucleus and rostral neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> binding progresses further than reduction in D1 binding within the first 24 h following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> and D1 binding sites, the areas of reduced binding 24 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion predicted the area of histopathological change </plain></SENT>
