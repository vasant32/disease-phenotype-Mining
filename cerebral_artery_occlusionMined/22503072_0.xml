<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Matrine (Mat) and oxymatrine are two major <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloids</z:chebi> of the Chinese herb Sophora flavescens Ait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Leguminosae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous study has demonstrated that Mat reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, oxymatrine has been reported to produce neuroprotective effects against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB in the ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated whether direct protection on neurons and astrocytes via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway is associated with Mat's neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), Mat (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) reduced the infarction volume and improved the neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner, administered 10 min, 3h and even 6h following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mat 50 mg/kg also decreased the hemispheric water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of GFAP-positive cells was markedly decreased in the ischemic cortex at 12h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Mat increased the number of GFAP-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mat 50mg/kg has no effect on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary neuron or astrocyte cultures were exposed to a paradigm of ischemic insult by using an oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), Mat (50-200 μM) reduced LDH leakage and the number of neuronal and astrocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and increased the number of MAP2-positive and GFAP-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further observations revealed that Mat increased the protein levels of IκBα, and blocked the translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus in the ischemic cortex and injured neurons and astrocytes induced by in vitro OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Mat could down-regulate NF-κB p65 downstream pro-apoptotic gene p53 and/or c-Myc in the injured neurons and astrocytes induced by OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that Mat, even when administrated 6h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, has neuroprotective effects against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and directly protects neurons and astrocytes via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to matrine's neuroprotection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
