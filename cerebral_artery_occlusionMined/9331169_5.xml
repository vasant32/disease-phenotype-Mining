<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have shown increases in the immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y and tyrosine hydroxylase in the insular cortex surrounding the focal infarction after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y, leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> increased ipsilaterally in the amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increases in immunoreactivity were observed in nerve terminals and fibers; changes in the neuropeptides were maximal 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local excitotoxic injury of the insular cortex also elicited similar neuropeptide changes unilaterally in the same regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, immunohistochemistry was used following intracerebroventricular injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to determine whether blockade of axonal transport would prevent these neurochemical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These experiments would also locate the putative cellular origins of the neurochemicals involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control rats received either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> injection or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> enhanced the periinfarct increase in neuropeptide Y but did not alter the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuropeptide Y increase was observed in local cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> prevented the increases in immunoreactivity for the neuropeptides in the amygdala on the side of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although there were small perikarya that showed immunoreactivity for these neuropeptides within the amygdala on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that local cortical neurons are responsible for the increase in neuropeptide Y in the periinfarct region, that the cortical increase in tyrosine hydroxylase is not dependent on fast axonal transport, and that axonal transport of signals from the insular cortex to the amygdala is critical in mediating the amygdalar neuropeptide changes seen after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
