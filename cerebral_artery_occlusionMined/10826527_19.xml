<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801, to protect myelinated axons after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunocytochemistry was used to assess the anatomic extent of axonal injury, and conventional histopathology was used to assess the volume of ischemic damage to neuronal perikarya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded in 16 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cats were treated with either vehicle or MK-801 as a 0.5-mg/kg bolus at 15 minutes before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by an infusion of 0.14 mg/kg per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6 hours, the animals were killed and the brains processed for histology and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was determined from 16 preselected coronal levels of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The circumscribed zones of APP accumulation in axons were mapped onto images at the same 16 coronal levels, and quantitative analysis was performed using a transparent counting grid, randomly placed over each image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histologic appearance and anatomic location of axons with increased APP immunoreactivity was similar in animals treated with vehicle and MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MK-801 failed to reduce the hemispheric APP score significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated animals, there was a significant association between the volume of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and the amount of APP immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MK-801 significantly reduced the slope of the association between the volume of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and the amount of APP immunoreactivity compared with that observed in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, the ratio of hemispheric APP score and volume of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was significantly increased with MK-801 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> to protect axons may limit their functional efficacy in improving functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
