<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> on cardiac function in a mouse model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four hours after the induction of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, cardiac function was measured in mice by endovascular catheterization of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after hemodynamic measurements, mice were euthanized and brains were excised and sectioned to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the severity of insular cortex injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial damage was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum and heart levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 9 out of 14 mice that underwent left pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these 9 mice, the severity of left insular cortex lesion was greater than the mice with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum and heart levels of NE were significantly higher in left pMCAO mice with heart dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Liner regression analysis indicates significant inverse correlation between the severity of left insular cortex damage and heart dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice that underwent right pMCAO did not exhibit cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that left focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can produce cardiac dysfunction, which is associated with the extent of left insular cortex damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mice exhibiting cardiac dysfunction had elevated levels of NE in the serum and heart </plain></SENT>
