<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that administration of 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1-(4-phenylbutyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidine</z:chebi> (PPBP), a potent sigma-receptor ligand, during transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> would affect early postischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized cats underwent left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 90 minutes followed by 4 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control cats received saline (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental cats (2 groups, n = 10 per group) were treated with PPBP at a rate of 0.1 mumol/kg per hour (PPBP-0.1) or administered 1 mumol/kg per hour (PPBP-1) intravenously from 75 minutes after initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and continuing during the 4 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As measured by the microsphere method, blood flow to the ipsilateral caudate nucleus was decreased similarly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the ipsilateral inferior temporal cortex was decreased during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups but was higher in cats subsequently treated with PPBP at the highest dose, even before drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in blood flow to the ipsilateral caudate nucleus or inferior temporal cortex (area of greatest cortical injury) during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium-determined injury volume of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere (control, 29 +/- 5%; PPBP-0.1, 17 +/- 3%; PPBP-1, 6 +/- 1% of ipsilateral hemisphere; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and caudate nucleus (control, 49 +/- 5%; PPBP-0.1, 39 +/- 6%; PPBP-1, 25 +/- 5% of ipsilateral caudate nucleus) was less in cats treated with 1 mumol/kg per hour of PPBP compared with cats treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cats treated with 0.1 mumol/kg per hour had a 45% smaller hemispheric injury volume than the control group without differences in intraischemic blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recovery of somatosensory evoked potential amplitude was greater in cats treated with PPBP-1 compared with control (control, 18 +/- 11%; PPBP-0.1, 30 +/- 14%; PPBP-1, 54 +/- 14% of baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that sigma-receptors may play an important role in the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury in both the cortex and the caudate nucleus after 90 minutes of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because PPBP afforded protection when administered at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and during reperfusion, sigma-receptors may contribute to the progression of injury in ischemic border regions </plain></SENT>
