<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> exerts neuroprotective effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> attenuate ischemic brain injury in young female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, neurodegenerative events occur more frequently in elderly women who are chronically hypoestrogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether aging rats remain responsive to the neuroprotective actions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young (3-4 months) and middle-aged (9-12 months) rats were ovariectomized and treated for 1 week with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored in some animals at the time of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24 h after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that in both young and aging rats, low and high physiological doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> decrease ischemic injury by almost 50%, compared with oil-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> acts in both age groups via blood flow-independent mechanisms, as basal and postinjury blood flow was equivalent between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>- and oil-treated young and aging rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that replacement with physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related injury in young and aging female rats and strongly suggest that older animals remain responsive to the protective actions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
