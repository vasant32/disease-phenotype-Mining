<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that administering human umbilical cord blood cells after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, presumably by rescuing cells within the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined whether the cord blood cells enhanced astrocyte survival in an in vitro model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary astrocyte cultures were incubated for 2 h in no oxygen (95% N, 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) and low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1% compared to 4.5%) media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cord blood mononuclear cells were added to half the cultures at the beginning of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte viability was determined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> diacetate/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (FDA/PI) labeling and cytokine production by the astrocytes measured using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some studies, T cells, B cells or monocytes/macrophages isolated from the cord blood mononuclear fraction with magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS) were used instead to determine which cellular component of the cord blood mononuclear fraction was responsible for the observed effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-culturing mononuclear cord blood cells with astrocytes during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> stimulated production of IL-6 and IL-10 during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cord blood T cells decreased survival of the astrocytes after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> but had no effect on the examined cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the tested cord blood fractions do not enhance astrocyte survival when delivered individually, suggesting there is either another cellular component that is neuroprotective or an interaction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells is essential for protection </plain></SENT>
