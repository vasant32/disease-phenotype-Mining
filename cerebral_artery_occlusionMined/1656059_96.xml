<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two different techniques were utilized to identify the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) into cerebral tissue following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>: histologic analysis and a modified myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after producing permanent cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by occluding and severing the middle cerebral artery of male spontaneously hypertensive rats, contralateral hemiparalysis and sensory-motor deficits were observed due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of the frontal and parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-and-eosin-stained histologic sections, PMN, predominantly neutrophils, were identified at various stages of diapedesis from deep cerebral and meningeal vessels at the periphery of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, into brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When MPO activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue was studied initially, it could not be demonstrated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues extracted from non-washed homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, if tissue was homogenized in phosphate buffer (i.e., washed), MPO activity was expressed upon extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utilizing this modified assay, MPO activity was significantly increased only in the infarcted cortex compared to other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was observed in non-perfused animals and after perfusion with isotonic saline to remove blood constituents from the vasculature prior to brain removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased PMN infiltration and MPO activity were not observed in forebrain tissue of sham-operated control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, MPO activity was not increased in the ischemic cortex of MCAO rats perfused immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, indicating that blood was not trapped in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By using a leukocyte histochemical staining assay, activity of peroxidases was identified within vascular-adhering/infiltrating PMN in the infarcted cortex 24 hr after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of several blood components indicated that increased MPO activity was selective for PMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observed increase of approximately 0.3 U MPO/g wet weight ischemic tissue vs. nonischemic cerebral tissues probably reflects the increased vascular adherance/infiltration of approximately 600,000 PMN/g wet weight infarcted cortex 24 hr after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This combined biochemical and histological study strongly suggests that PMN adhere within blood vessels and infiltrate into brain tissue injured by focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that the associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> might contribute to delayed progressive tissue damage in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This modified MPO assay is a useful, quantitative index of PMN that can be utilized to elucidate the potential deleterious consequences of neutrophils infiltrating into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, trauma, or other pro-inflammatory stimuli </plain></SENT>
