<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the control group (n=9) received no treatment, HBO group (n=9) was treated for 90 min at 2.5 absolute atmosphere for 3 days, the U-74389G group (n=8) received single U-74389G injection (3 mg/kg), the HBO + U-74389G group (n=8) received both HBO and U-74389G treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatments were initiated within the first 10 min after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 days, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in rat brains were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratios were 25.6+/-6.5 % for the control group, 21.9+/-6.4 % for the HBO group, 15.7+/-5.7 % for U-74389G group and 12.5+/-3.8 % for HBO + U74389G group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly reduced in rats treated with U-74389G (p&lt;0.05) and combination therapy (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HBO failed to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that 1) U-74389G is more beneficial than HBO on permanent MCAO in rats, and 2) a combined therapy failed to significantly improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume more than either single treatment </plain></SENT>
