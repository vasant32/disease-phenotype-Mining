<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Astroglial proliferation and delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are two common pathological processes in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear if <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> causes delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we addressed this potential linkage by examining the relationship between attenuated astrocyte proliferation, induced by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibition, and delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in rat ischemic hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), astrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and proliferation were closely associated with delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, administration of olomoucine, a selective CDK inhibitor, not only suppressed astroglial proliferation and glial scar formation, but also decreased neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ischemic boundary zone and hippocampal CA1 region at days 1 and 30 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> and delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, at least in rat hippocampus, are sequential pathological events following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, suppressing astroglial cell cycle progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be beneficial to neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study also implies that cell cycle regulation should be considered as a promising future therapeutic intervention in treating those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> characterized by an excessive astrocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
