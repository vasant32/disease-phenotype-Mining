<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplanted neurospheres survived robustly in naive and ischemic brains 4 wk posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival was influenced by proximity of the graft to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion and was negatively correlated with the number of IB4-positive inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targeted migration of the human cells was seen in ischemic animals, with many human cells migrating long distances ( approximately 1.2 mm) predominantly toward the lesion; in naive rats, cells migrated radially from the injection site in smaller number and over shorter distances (0.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of migrating cells in ischemic rats had a neuronal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Migrating cells between the graft and the lesion expressed the neuroblast marker doublecortin, whereas human cells at the lesion border expressed the immature neuronal marker beta-tubulin, although a small percentage of cells at the lesion border also expressed glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, transplanted human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> (hCNS)-derived neurospheres survived robustly in naive and ischemic brains, and the microenvironment influenced their migration and fate </plain></SENT>
