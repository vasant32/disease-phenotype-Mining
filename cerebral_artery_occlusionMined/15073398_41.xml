<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Use of thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is limited by a short therapeutic window because delayed reperfusion may cause brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Available evidence suggests a role for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, NO, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in reperfusion-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, depending on their cellular origin and interactions between them, these molecules may exert protective or deleterious actions, neither of which is characterized in the intact brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi>, we determined <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation within neurons, astrocytes, and endothelium, and the association between oxidative/nitrative stress and vascular injury in mice brains subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 3 or 5 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both signals were colocalized, suggesting that the main source of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in the reperfused brain was a reaction between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation was particularly intense in microvessels and astrocytic end-feet surrounding them, and overlapped with dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sites of oxidative/nitrative stress on microvessels were colocalized with markers of vascular injury such as Evans blue (EB) leakage and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, suggesting an association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and microvascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supporting this idea, partial inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis at reperfusion with a low dose of L-nitroarginine (1 mg/kg IP) reduced 3-nitrotyrosine formation in microvessels and EB extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During reperfusion, intense <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, NO, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation on microvessels and surrounding end-feet may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by disrupting microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination of thrombolysis with agents diminishing oxidative/nitrative stress may reduce reperfusion-induced injury and extend the therapeutic window for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
