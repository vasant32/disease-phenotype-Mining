<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, we examined which range of values of the orientation-independent diffusion quantity Dav = 1/3Trace(D) = 1/3(Dxx + Dyy + Dzz) is an early noninvasive indicator of reduced cerebral perfusion and focal brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cats underwent either a 30-min occlusion followed by 3.5 h reperfusion (n = 7) or a 60-min occlusion followed by 4-h reperfusion (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated measurements of CBF were made with radiolabeled microspheres, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal injury was measured with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During occlusion, the decrease in Dav correlated with CBF for caudate [30-min occlusion (n = 13): p &lt; 0.0001: 60-min occlusion (n = 6): p &lt; 0.02] and for cortex [30-min occlusion (n = 12): p &lt; 0.0001: 60-min occlusion (n = 5): p &lt; 0.04] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variable caudate and hemispheric injury levels were found among cats in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of tissue injury demarcated by TTC began to correlate with the area of reduced Dav by 30 min of occlusion (p &lt; 0.02), and this correlation improved (p &lt; 0.0001) at 1, 1.5, and 2.0 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time necessary to reach a one-to-one correspondence between the percent of hemisphere injured and the percent of hemispheric area with Dav &lt; 0.65 x 10(-9) m2/s was 2 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absolute value of Dav is a good indicator of the risk of tissue injury, whereas the combination of Dav and the length of time of Dav reduction is an excellent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal tissue injury demarcated by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
