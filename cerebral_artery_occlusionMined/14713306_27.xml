<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our studies observed that, consistent with the literature, ischemic/hypoxic insults increased the expression of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (Kv) 1.2 potassium channel as well as elevating the endogenous level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in neurons of adult rat brain following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and in SH-SY5Y cells after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, we also observed that ischemic injury increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv 1.2 in in vivo and in vitro; the introduction of exogenous VEGF could attenuate cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in in vitro models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the protective effect of VEGF is mediated through its up-regulative actions on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv 1.2, which in turn has a direct influence on cell viability after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In substantiation of this result, we used anti-sense methodology to suppress the expression of endogenous VEGF, which significantly inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv 1.2 and increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> elicited by ischemic/hypoxic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel by VEGF in neuronal cells was significantly attenuated in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), or genestin, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, thus suggesting that the phosphorylation of Kv 1.2 induced by VEGF is mechanistically linked to the PI3-K pathway </plain></SENT>
