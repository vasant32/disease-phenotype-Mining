<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 65-year-old man who presented with mild, rapidly improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> magnetic resonance imaging disclosed no diffusion abnormalities but a tandem internal carotid artery/distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> associated with a large corresponding deficit on perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a cross-flow to the middle cerebral artery via the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intravenous thrombolysis was initiated that led to rapid reopening of the middle cerebral artery and left the patient free of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our observation highlights the possible benefit of systemic thrombolytic treatment even in the setting of an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the substantial contribution of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging for a risk-benefit estimate </plain></SENT>
