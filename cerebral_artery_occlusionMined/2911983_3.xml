<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of intravenous nicardipine in the prevention of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> has been investigated in a dose escalation study in 67 patients admitted within 1 week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcomes were noted in 52 patients (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was found by arteriography in 31 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dose-related trend was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the lower dose levels, angiographic spasm was observed in 68% and symptomatic vasospasm in 27% of 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only eight of 33 patients (24%) treated at the highest dose level (approximately 10 mg/hr) developed arteriographic evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was diagnosed in only two of 33 patients (6%) treated with this dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from vasospasm occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Verification of changes in tissue calcium has been obtained from the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, and we concluded that nicardipine administered after permanent occlusion may offer protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in this animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine uptake was greater at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site than in surrounding tissue, with the highest concentration in the area of maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine appears to affect changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> more than other ions: it significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> accumulation in the territory of the middle cerebral artery by 60% at 6 hours, and significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and K+ shifts in the same territory by 40% and 50%, respectively, at 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although much research remains to be done, a wide role for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> in a number of cerebrovascular conditions is emerging </plain></SENT>
