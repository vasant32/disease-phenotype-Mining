<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Remote ischemic conditioning is cardioprotective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and neuroprotective in mechanical occlusion models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no report on its therapeutic potential in a physiologically relevant embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) in combination with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested remote ischemic perconditioning therapy (RIPerC) at 2 hours after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the mouse with and without intravenous tPA at 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed cerebral blood flow up to 6 hours, neurological deficits, injury size, and phosphorylation of Akt (Serine(473)) as a prosurvival signal in the ischemic hemisphere at 48 hours poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RIPerC therapy alone improved the cerebral blood flow and neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>tPA alone at 4 hours did not significantly improve the neurological outcome even after successful thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individual treatments with RIPerC and intravenous tPA reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (25.7% and 23.8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy of RIPerC and tPA resulted in additive effects in further improving the neurological outcome and reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the therapeutic treatments upregulated phosphorylation of Akt in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RIPerC is effective alone after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and has additive effects in combination with intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RIPerC may be a simple, safe, and inexpensive combination therapy with intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
