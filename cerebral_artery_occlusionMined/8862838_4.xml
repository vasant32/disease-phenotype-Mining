<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The treatment was contrived for a two hour interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A (n = 16) was left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B (n = 16) received an intravenous infusion of LY231617 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group C (n = 16) received saline (86 microliters/min) by retrograde infusion of the cerebral vein (RICV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group D (n = 22) was administered LY231617 (10mg/kg/2 hr) in saline (86 microliters/min) by RICV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine and blood-brain transfer constant with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-alpha-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16135">isobutyric acid</z:chebi> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early ischemic damage was histologically examined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> and Luxol fast blue and with triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results revealed a marked increase in local cerebral blood flow (over 600%, p &lt; 0.01) after RICV with LY231617, with a significant improvement of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in rats from group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain damage measured with Luxol fast blue and triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> methods showed a significant improvement (50-91%) of ischemic damage in group D, as compared to groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Retrograde infusion of the cerebral vein with LY231617 resulted in a significant amelioration at seven hours post <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
