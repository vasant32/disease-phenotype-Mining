<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice subjected to 6-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with delayed tPA alone at 6 h, with combined tPA plus cilostazol at 6 h, or with vehicle at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used multiple imaging (electron microscopy, spectroscopy), histological and neurobehavioral measures to assess the effects of the treatment at 18 h and 7 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the mechanism of cilostazol to beneficial effect, we also performed an in vitro study with tPA and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor</z:chebi> in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with tPA plus cilostazol prevented development of hemorrhagic transformation, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, prevented endothelial injury via reduction MMP-9 activity, and prevented the blood-brain barrier opening by inhibiting decreased claudin-5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality at 18 h and 7 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the administration of both drugs prevented injury to brain human endothelial cells and human brain pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor</z:chebi> prevents the hemorrhagic transformation induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice treated with tPA </plain></SENT>
