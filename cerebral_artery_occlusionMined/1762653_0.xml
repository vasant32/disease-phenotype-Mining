<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the transorbital approach, a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was exposed and temporarily obstructed by a Zen's clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into ten groups (each group: N = 8) according to the ischemic time of 10, 20, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five hours after the recanalization, Evans' blue dye was injected intravenously and after further 30 minutes, the brain was fixed with transaortal perfusion for histological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cranial window was made above the ectosylvian gyrus which has poor anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pial vessel behavior was observed through the cranial window and evaluated using an intravital microscope and a videoangiometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the correlation between functional change of vessel behavior and pathological change in the brain, the threshold time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> inflicting irreversible damage was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 30 minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, deterioration of vessel behavior began to be observed as well as extravasation of Evans' blue dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the ischemic duration became longer, infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, which showed close correlation, increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was 6 hours, the infarcted area was significantly larger than that of the 4-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) markedly increased as soon as recanalization took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We think this phenomenon is due mainly to swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>About three hours after recanalization, ICP further increased due to severe vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
