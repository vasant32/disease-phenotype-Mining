<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSC-like multipotent precursor cells (PMSCs) have also been suggested to exist in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that treatment with PMSCs may have a therapeutic benefit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we compared the efficacy of systemic delivery of BMSCs and PMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rat was induced by intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with a microfilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat BMSCs and PMSCs were prepared in culture and intravenously injected into the rats 6 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was assessed at 6 h, and 1, 3, and 7 days using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic change of cerebral blood perfusion on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was assessed the same times using perfusion-weighted image (PWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed using the treadmill stress test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both BMSCs and PMSCs treated groups had reduced lesion volume, improved regional cerebral blood flow, and functional improvement compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic benefits of both MSC-treated groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PMSCs derived from peripheral blood could be an important cell source of cell therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
