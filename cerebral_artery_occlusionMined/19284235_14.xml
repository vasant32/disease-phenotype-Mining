<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have previously shown that EPO and IGF-I, when administered together, provide <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and prolonged neuroprotection in cerebrocortical cultures against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether intranasally applied EPO plus IGF-I can provide <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotection in an animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and to show that intranasal administration is more efficient at delivering EPO plus IGF-I to the brain when compared with intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The EPO and IGF-I were administered intranasally to mice that underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volumes were measured after 1 hour of MCAO and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the long-term effects of this treatment, behavioral outcomes were assessed at 3, 30, 60, and 90 days following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiography and liquid scintillation were used to visualize and quantify the uptake of radiolabeled 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I into the mouse brain after intranasal, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intranasal administration of EPO plus IGF-I reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes within 24 hours and improved neurological function in mice up to 90 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I were found in the brain within 20 minutes after intranasal administration and accumulated within the injured areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, intranasal administration delivered significantly higher levels of the applied 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I to the brain compared with intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that intranasal EPO plus IGF-I penetrates into the brain more efficiently than other drug delivery methods and could potentially provide a fast and efficient treatment to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
