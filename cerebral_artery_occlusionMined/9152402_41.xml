<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of a free radical scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one</z:chebi> (MCl-186), on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, neurological deficits and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), with use of a rat thrombotic distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) occlusion model to elucidate its possible therapeutic effects on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have attempted to measure 2-oxo-3-(phenylhydrazono)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">butanoic acid</z:chebi> (OPB), which is the major oxidation product of MCl-186, in the penumbral cortex of a thrombotic dMCA occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postischemic treatment with MCl-186 (3 mg/kg) significantly (P &lt; .05) decreased the size of the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCl-186 (3 mg/kg) significantly (P &lt; .05) improved the neurological deficits 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, MCl-186 had no effect on rCBF 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCl-186 mainly reacted into OPB by peroxidation in rat brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in OPB content in the ischemic penumbral cortex tissue was confirmed after 90 min of MCl-186 perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MCI-186 has a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> by reacting with oxygen radicals and that oxygen radicals are closely related to postischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
