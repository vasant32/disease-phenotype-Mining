<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many herbal drugs and extracts have been used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSâ„¢), a new herbal drug, on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE GROUPS: sham-operated, ischemic animals treated with distilled water as vehicle, ischemic animals treated with 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg of Semilil respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was used in NMRI rats and neuronal injury analyzed in hippocampal CA1 sector after 48 hrs of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of this study showed that treatment with semelil attenuated ischemic damages and has positive effects on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
