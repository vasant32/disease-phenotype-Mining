<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of ligustrazine on the migration of neuronal precursors (NPs) after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in adult rats and explore its acting mechanism on recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat model of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established by thread ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ligustrazine 40 mg/kg was injected peritoneally once a day 2 h after modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st day after operation, the migration of Doublecortin (DCX, the marker of NPs) in subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS) were observed with immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The migration of DCX-positive cells in SVZ (abbrev. as migration below) through RMS into the olfactory bulb started from the 3rd day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and lasted to the 21st day; the migration directly or through RMS into the ischemic penumbra of the adjacent striatum started on the 7th day, and increased significantly on the 14th day; and a few of DCX positive cells migrated through corpus callosum into the ischemic cortex on the 21st day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The migration was similar in the two groups in its pathway, but the extent in the ligustrazine group was more intensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine could promote direct migration of NPs into the ischemic cerebral cortex and striatum, suggesting that it might play an important role in promoting self-recovery of brain function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> through accelerating the migration of NPs </plain></SENT>
