<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further elucidate the endocannabinoid and cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1) involvment in the rapid ischemic tolerance induced by EA pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at investigating the involvement of the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) in the neuroprotection conferred by EA pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min at 2h and 24h following EA pretreatment in male Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic injury was evaluated by neurobehavioral scores and infarction volume percentages 72 h after reperfusion in the presence or absence of AM251, a selective CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and AM630, a selective CB2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of CB1 and CB2 receptor in the striatum of ischemic hemisphere was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rapid and delayed ischemic tolerance induced by EA pretreatment was respectively reversed by AM251 and AM630 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CB2 receptor expression was up-regulated in the striatum of rat brains at 24h after EA stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CB2 receptor contributed to the delayed neuroprotective effect whereas CB1 receptor to the rapid ischemic tolerance induced by EA pretreatment against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
