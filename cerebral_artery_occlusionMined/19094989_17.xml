<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses to account for the therapeutic mechanisms have been suggested, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is thought to be of critical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have reported the therapeutic benefits of hMSCs which have been transfected with the angiopoietin-1 gene in a rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To potentially enhance the therapeutic effects of angiopoietin-1 gene-modified hMSC (Ang-hMSC), we transfected hMSCs with the angiopoietin-1 gene and the VEGF gene, and investigated whether the combination of Ang-1 and VEGF gene-modified hMSCs (Ang-VEGF-hMSC) contribute to functional recovery in a rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We induced MCAO using intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and hMSCs, Ang-hMSCs, VEGF-hMSCs or Ang-VEGF-hMSCs were intravenously infused 6 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI and behavioral analyses revealed that rats receiving Ang-VEGF-hMSCs showed the greatest structural-functional recovery as compared to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intravenous administration of hMSCs transfected with the angiopoietin-1 and VEGF gene using a fiber-mutant adenovirus vector may represent a new strategy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
