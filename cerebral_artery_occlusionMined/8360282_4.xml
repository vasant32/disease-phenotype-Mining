<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BMS-181321 is therefore a marker of ischemic tissue at risk of infarction and its uptake, unlike that of x-ray and magnetic resonance contrast agents, does not require disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In keeping with this conclusion, we have found that the single-pass cerebral extraction fraction of BMS-181321 is 0.67 at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat whole-brain blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic images obtained from cats after MCAO show that the initial distribution of BMS-181321 approximates regional CBF and that selective retention subsequently produces a positive image within the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMS-181321 is the first Tc complex able to indicate not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but also ischemic tissue at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of this novel Tc complex to monitor biochemical events during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may contribute to the clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
