<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 120 min in adult SD rats with intracerebroventricular VIP administration at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to assay BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells, expressions of VEGF, flt-1 and flk-1 in the ischemic zone, and the protein expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the brain was measured using Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed significantly increased BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells on the margins of the ischemic lesion in rats treated with VIP as compared with that in the control rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VIP significantly increased the number of VEGF immunoreactive cells and flt-1- and flk-1-positive endothelial cells in comparison with the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed that VIP treatment resulted in significantly increased VEGF protein level in the ipsilateral hemisphere (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VIP enhances <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic brain by increasing the expressions of VEGF in the brain tissue and its receptors flt-1 and flk-1 in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
