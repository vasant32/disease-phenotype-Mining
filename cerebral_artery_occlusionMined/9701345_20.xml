<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that administration of an interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> protein (IL-1ra) reduces ischemic brain injury; however, the detrimental mechanism initiated by interleukin-1 (IL-1) in ischemic brain injury is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used mice that were transfected to overexpress human IL-1ra to elucidate the role of IL-1 in the activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunohistostaining were used as a marker of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral vector (1 x 10(9) particles) was administered by injection into the right lateral ventricle in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five days later, MCAO was performed on the mice using a suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO was achieved for 24 hours in the Ad.RSVIL-1ra-transfected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ad.RSVlacZ-transfected, and saline (control) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activity was quantified in each region and localization of MPO was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of MCAO, the surface cerebral blood flow was reduced to 13.5% +/- 3.4%, 10.75% +/- 2.6%, and 10.9% +/- 2.6% of baseline in the ischemic hemisphere in Ad.RSVIL-1ra-transfected, Ad.RSVlacZ-transfected, and saline-treated mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MPO activity in the ischemic hemisphere in the Ad.RSVlacZ group was similar to that in the saline control group (cortex: 0.40 +/- 0.22 versus 0.33 +/- 0.11; basal ganglia: 0.46 +/- 0.23 versus 0.49 +/- 0.17; P &gt; 0.05); however, it was significantly reduced in the Ad.RSVIL-1ra group (cortex: 0.18 +/- 0.07; basal ganglia: 0.26 +/- 0.15; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase immunohistochemistry showed that the massive accumulation of MPO-positive cells in the ischemic cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum regions was greatly attenuated in Ad.RSVIL-1ra-transfected mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Ad.RSVIL-1ra-transfected mice provide a useful tool to study the mechanism of action of IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MPO activity assay and immunostaining after 24 hours of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were significantly reduced in IL-1ra gene-transfected mice, suggesting that IL-1 may play an important role in the activation of inflammatory cells during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
