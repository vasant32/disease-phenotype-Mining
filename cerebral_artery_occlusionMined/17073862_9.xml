<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS8 are proteases involved in extracellular matrix proteolysis and antiangiogenesis, but little is known about their expression and function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the changes in ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS8 in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-actin, cyclophilin, and RPL13A were examined in order to validate the appropriate housekeeping genes for a long duration after inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to pMCAO, and ischemic penumbra was collected at 2, 24 h, 3, 7, and 21 days after inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ADAMTS1, ADAMTS8, and the four housekeeping genes were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of beta-actin increased up to 21 days, and that of GAPDH decreased at 24 h after pMCAO, with no statistically significant changes in RPL13A and cyclophilin being detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased at 2 h after pMCAO, peaked at 24 h, and remained at a high level until 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of ADAMTS8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decreased at 2 and 24 h after pMCAO, followed by a slight increase at 3 days, and then decreased again at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that RPL13A and cyclophilin are two appropriate housekeeping genes for the rat pMCAO model up to 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels increased, but ADAMTS8 decreased after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data provide new insight into the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and self-repair after injury </plain></SENT>
