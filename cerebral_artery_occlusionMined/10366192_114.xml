<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degradation of the basal lamina and extracellular matrix are, in part, responsible for the loss of vascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play a primary role in basal lamina degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using a sensitive modification of gelatin zymography, the authors investigated the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in frozen 10-microm sections of ischemic and nonischemic basal ganglia and plasma samples of 27 non-human primates after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) for various periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gelatinolytic activities were compared with parallel cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> incorporation in the ischemic zones of adjacent sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the brain, the integrated density of MMP-2 increased significantly by 1 hour after MCAO and was persistently elevated thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression was highly correlated with the extent of neuron injury and the number of injured neurons (r = 0.9763, SE = 0.004, 2P &lt; 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression only was significantly increased in subjects with hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In plasma, only MMP-9 increased transiently at 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the early potential role of MMP-2 in the degradation of basal lamina leading to neuronal injury, and an association of MMP-9 with hemorrhagic transformation after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
