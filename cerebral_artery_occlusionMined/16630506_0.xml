<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats prepared by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion were used as the research model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into A group (untreated), B group (DMSO control) and C group (treated with z-DEVD-fmk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before reperfusion, z-DEVD-fmk (7 microg/kg) was injected into the ischemic side of ventriculus cerebri of C group rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression and activation of caspase-3, expression and cleavage of poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP), and apoptotic neurons in the temporal-parietal cortex IRRs (SPAB method) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the rats were studied using Western blotting, in situ apoptotic detection (TUNEL method) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cerebral IRRs of A, B, C groups reperfused for 1 h and 24 h, the quantities of caspase-3 precursor were 16.7 +/- 3.0, 11.5 +/- 3.0 and 47.5 +/- 3.5, and 76.1 +/- 3.5, 71.3 +/- 6.4 and 88.2 +/- 5.5, respectively; the caspase-3 fragments (12,000) 8.2 +/- 2.3, 9.4 +/- 1.2 and 4.3 +/- 1.6, and 59.0 +/- 6.3, 60.5 +/- 7.2 and 17.3 +/- 2.8, respectively; the PARP 12.6 +/- 3.0, 13.9 +/- 2.0 and 53.7 +/- 4.1, and 67.5 +/- 8.6, 61.1 +/- 6.6 and 93.6 +/- 4.1, respectively; the PARP fragments (24,000) 6.0 +/- 0.7, 6.6 +/- 1.2, 3.6 +/- 1.1, and 27.4 +/- 2.6, 25.8 +/- 3.2, 12.1 +/- 2.8 (relative quantity, x+/- s); the densities of apoptotic neurons 83.3 +/- 7.5, 84.3 +/- 5.7 and 45.7 +/- 4.0, and 197.4 +/- 11.8, 185.2 +/- 11.2 and 99.1 +/- 5.8 (cell number/0.1 mm(2), x+/- s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that in the cerebral IRRs of both A and B groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> caspase-3 expression and activation, PARP expression and cleavage, and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were increased relevantly along with prolongation of the reperfusion time (P &lt; 0.05 - 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At each time point of the reperfusion, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cerebral IRR of C group were significantly less than those of the former two groups (P &lt; 0.05 - 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variations of the 5 parameters of A, B and C groups correlated positively with one another (r = 0.630 - 0.942, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cells expressing PARP were mainly neurons in the cerebral IRRs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals, but the difference of their number was not distinct among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is an important mechanism resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the injured neurons in the cerebral IRR that caspase-3 expression and activation abnormally increased by the reperfusion have more PARP rapidly inactivated by over-cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>z-DEVD-fmk may decrease PARP cleavage by inhibiting activity and auto-activation of caspase-3, and prevent the injured neurons from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
