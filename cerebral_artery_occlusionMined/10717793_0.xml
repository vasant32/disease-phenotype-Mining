<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EAA concentrations are regulated by uptake mechanisms through high-affinity EAA transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since EAA uptake is energy-dependent, it is a matter of interest to explore the relationship between the EAA transporter and derangement of flow-metabolism during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the regional changes in EAA transporters after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats by in vitro autoradiography using [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> as a ligand, and correlated these changes to the local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (LCMRglc) determined by in vivo double-labeled autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The values of specific binding of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> decreased maximally by 20% in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the reduction in specific binding correlated well with the changes in LCBF and LCMRglc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In half of the regions with LCMRglc between 80 and 120% of the intact side, the values of the specific binding were relatively preserved, while in the remainder of the regions in the ischemic hemisphere, with LCMRglc ranging from 40 to 160% of the intact side, there was a reduction in specific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that energy failure and the related perturbation caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can decrease EAA uptake capacity, leading to further deterioration </plain></SENT>
