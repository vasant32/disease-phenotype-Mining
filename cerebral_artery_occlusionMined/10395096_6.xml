<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24-h reperfusion, rats were treated with ethyl eicosapentate (100 mg kg(-1); ethyl eicosapentate treated) or saline (saline treated) by gavage, once a day for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization were measured autoradiographically, and infarction size was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic side, the local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization values in the parietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen, which constituted the ischemic core, were equivalent to zero in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peri-infarcted areas, i.e., the frontal cortex and medial caudoputamen, were significantly higher in the ethyl eicosapentate treated group than the saline treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the non-ischemic side, ethyl eicosapentate treated group had a tendency to improve local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization values in a medial caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ethyl eicosapentate treatment may be beneficial for maintaining cerebral circulation and metabolism except for infarction area after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
