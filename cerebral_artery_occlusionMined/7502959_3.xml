<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To correlate the location of large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with the site of cerebrovascular occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined CT and angiographic findings of 38 patients with major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> and newly developed large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 2.0 cm or more, which were classified into three types: striatocapsular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia, terminal supply area <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, and terminal supply area <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the centrum semiovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two or three of the types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were sometimes combined; the combination of the striatocapsular and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was the most frequent (14 [36.8%] of 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (89.5%) had atherosclerotic major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive diseases</z:e>; 22 (57.9%) had occlusive diseases of the internal carotid artery, and 12 (31.6%) had diseases of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 4 (10.5%) had embolic transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery occlusive diseases frequently produced striatocapsular (13 [81.3%] of 16) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (13 [81.3%] of 16) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but never induced the centrum semiovale lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in patients with internal carotid artery occlusive disease, the centrum semiovale (16 [72.7%] of 22) was more susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than the striatocapsular region (11 [50%] of 22) or the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (9 [40.9%] of 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Middle cerebral artery occlusive diseases frequently produced striatocapsular and/or <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but never induced the centrum semiovale lesions, which were usually associated with internal carotid artery occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
