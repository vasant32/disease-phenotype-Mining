<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and nNOS act in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-NO-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> cycle permitting a correct NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the brain, nNOS-positive neurons co-expressing ASS were known, while those co-expressing ASL were not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated by immunohistochemistry the presence of these types of neurons in the rat striatum to verify whether there was a correlation between their changes due to neurotoxic insults and animal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e>, a neurodegenerative insult model, was induced in rat brain by 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The striatum, the core of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, was examined at 24, 72 and 144 h after reperfusion and compared with that of rats in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ASS, ASL and nNOS-positive neurons, some of the latter also expressing ASS and ASL, were present both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after reperfusion, the number of the nNOS-positive neurons and the percentage of those co-expressing ASS and ASL were significantly increased in the animals with a longer survival and at 144 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> there was an almost complete restore of the number and/or percentage of these neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the neurons induced to express nNOS were the ASS- and ASL-positive ones and that the neurons co-expressing nNOS, ASS and ASL, since having the enzymes necessary to maintain a correct NO production, might protect from neurotoxic insults </plain></SENT>
