<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) is thought to represent cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary series of experiments, the infusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> model and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> models were used to confirm the direction of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> change in response to purely extracellular and cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> increased (p&lt;0.05) in the case of extracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and decreased (p&lt;0.001) in cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following these initial experiments, a new impact acceleration model was used to induce traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six adult Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into four groups; sham, trauma alone, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (HH), and THH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following trauma, a 30-minute insult of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (PaO2 of 40 mm Hg) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of 30 mm Hg) were imposed and the animals were resuscitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DWI was carried out at four 1-hour intervals postinjury, and MABP, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> in the control and HH groups remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> in the THH group rapidly decreased from a control level of 0.68 +/- 0.05 x 10(-3) mm2/second to 0.37 +/- 0.09 x 10(-3) mm2/second by 3 hours posttrauma (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this group, the decreased CBF and CPP during secondary insult remained low despite resuscitation, with the ICP increasing to 56 +/- 7 mm Hg by 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the trauma alone group, the rise in ICP reached a maximum value (28 +/- 3 mm Hg) at 30 minutes with a significant and sustained increase in CBF despite a gradual decrease in CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> in this group were not significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data lead the authors to suggest that the rise in ICP following severe trauma coupled with secondary insult in this model is predominately caused by cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plays a major role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after head injury </plain></SENT>
