<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the former model, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h, and the infarction area and volume were evaluated 24 h after the start of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter model, microthrombosis were induced by two injections of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> (interval, 2 days) into the internal carotid artery, and the neurologic deficits were evaluated on the day afer the 2nd injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ozagrel at 3 mg/kg decreased both the area and volume of the cortical infarction after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ozagrel also had suppressive effects on the neurologic deficits in the microthrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Norphenazone</z:chebi> at 1 and 3 mg/kg had no clear effects in either model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the suture-induced MCAO model and the microthrombosis model are models for occlusion-reperfusion of the major cerebral arteries and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, respectively, these results suggest a highly beneficial effect of ozagrel in the clinical therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
