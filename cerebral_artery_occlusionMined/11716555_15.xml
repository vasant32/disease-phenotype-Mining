<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Signal transduction pathways that lead to the modulation of genes related to survival and repair mechanisms are activated in neurons that survive injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These protein kinase/phosphatase cascades converge on transcription factors, the DNA binding proteins that directly regulate gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined expression of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit in the rat hippocampus 7 days after injury caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or trimethyltin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found increased levels of p50 in neurons throughout the hippocampus after both treatments, localized not only in cell bodies but also in processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the 7-day time point, Fluoro-Jade histochemistry revealed hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in trimethyltin-treated rats but not in those lesioned by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p50 was not expressed in Fluoro-Jade-positive degenerating cells, supporting the role of this transcriptional subunit in neurosurvival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because phosphorylation of the inhibitor IkappaB protein by IkappaB kinase is the classic step in NF-kappaB activation, phospho-IkappaBalpha immunoreactivity was examined as an indication of IkappaB kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha were increased in neurons throughout the hippocampus 7 days postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting for phospho-IkappaBalpha demonstrated increased levels 1 day postinjury that remained elevated for at least 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NF-kappaB signal transduction is involved in an adaptive response of neurons that survive injury </plain></SENT>
