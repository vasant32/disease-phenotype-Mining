<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the time-course of bradykinin production and kinin receptor expression as well as the conclusive role of bradykinin B2 receptors for brain damage after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have not been elucidated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to 45 mins of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h later brains were removed for the analysis of tissue bradykinin concentration and kinin B2 receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, functional outcome, and long-term survival were assessed in WT and B2-/- mice 24 h or 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue bradykinin was maximally increased 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (three-fold), while kinin B2 receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> upregulation peaked 24 to 48 h after MCAO (10- to 12-fold versus na√Øve brain tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that kinin B2 receptors were constitutively and widely expressed in mouse brain, were upregulated 2 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in cells showing signs of ischemic damage, and remained upregulated in the penumbra up to 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B2-/- mice had improved motor function (P&lt;0.05), smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (-38%; P&lt;0.01), developed less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (-87%; P&lt;0.05), and survived longer (P&lt;0.01) as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current results show that bradykinin is produced in the brain, kinin B2 receptors are upregulated on dying cells, and B2 receptors are involved in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
