<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the human genome, 16 different genes encoding for members of this emerging family of enzymes have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Known family members are PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-3, vPARP, tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2, each of them with a possible specific role in cell biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most studied member of the family is PARP-1, which is abundantly present in the nucleus and is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In pathological conditions, highly reactive radical species may cause DNA damage and PARP-1 hyperactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may lead to necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through massive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats treated with PARP inhibitors displayed reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, PARP inhibitors reduced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) or excitotoxins in primary cultures of murine cortical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, PARP inhibitors did not attenuate the OGD-induced selective loss of CA1 pyramidal cells in rat organotypic hippocampal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, they were not neuroprotective against transient bilateral carotid occlusion in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed that post-ischemic brain damage was predominally necrotic in cultured cortical cells, whereas a caspase-dependent apoptotic process was responsible for the CA1 pyramidal cell loss in hippocampal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, it appears reasonable to propose PARP inhibitors as useful therapeutic agents in pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393420" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain conditions</z:e> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> predominates </plain></SENT>
