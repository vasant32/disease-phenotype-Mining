<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel and specific ET(A) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, Ro 61-1790 [5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50414">methylpyridine</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi>-6-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-5-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-2-(2-1H-tetrazol-5-y l-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51643">pyridin-4-yl</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidin</z:chebi>-4-ylamide <z:chebi fb="8" ids="26714">sodium salt</z:chebi> (1:2)] (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), was used at doses that produced steady-state plasma concentrations and abolished ET-induced pial arteriolar vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cranial window preparation, 8 nmol/L ET constricted pial arterioles by 33 +/- 18% (mean +/- SD), but this response was ablated by intravenous Ro 61-1790 treatment (10-mg/kg bolus, 4-mg/kg/h infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In additional animal cohorts, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized cats were treated with 90 minutes of MCAO and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received Ro 61-1790 infusion beginning at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion and continuing for 6 or 24 hours (n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control cats were treated with 0.9% saline by intravenous infusion throughout reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in injury volume or neurologic evaluation score in saline-treated cats (n = 11; caudate 24 +/- 28%, cortical injury 7.5 +/- 5% of ipsilateral structure; score 52 +/- 8) versus the results in cats treated with Ro 61-1790 for either 24 hours (n = 6; caudate 22 +/- 23%, cortex 6 +/- 5%, injury volume of ipsilateral structure; score 55 +/- 3) or 6 hours (n = 11; caudate 33 +/- 30%, cortex 12 +/- 14%, injury volume of ipsilateral structure; score 50 +/- 10) </plain></SENT>
