<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications and side effects are common among these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study describes potential pitfalls in 3 techniques for middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to temporary MCAO for 90 minutes using the suture technique (group I; n=10) or to permanent MCAO using the suture technique (group II; n=10) or the macrosphere technique (group III; n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was performed after 3 hours and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours, animals underwent MRI and MRA to determine lesion size and the intracranial vascular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemispheric lesion volume was significantly smaller in group I (14.6%) compared with groups II (35.2%; P&lt;0.01) and III (21.3%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two animals (1 each in group II and III) did not demonstrate neurological deficits and had no lesion on MRI and a patent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was detected in 2 animals (1 each in group I and II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRA indicated a patent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem in 2 animals (group II), although both rats displayed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypothalamic infarction with subsequent pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in group II and in 1 rat in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Model failures occurred frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRA helps to identify animals that need to be excluded from experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
