<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model involving middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat which elicits changes in cardiac and autonomic variables that are similar to those observed clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is likely that these neurogenic autonomic responses are mediated by changes in neurotransmitter systems subsequent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This possibility was investigated by examining changes in immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y, leu-enkephalin, neurotoxins and dynorphin following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computerized image analysis was used to provide semi-quantitative measurements of the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic region was centered primarily in the insular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there are significant increases in immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y in the insular cortex within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropeptide Y staining was also significantly increased in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, ipsilateral to the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which did not appear to be included in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leu-enkephalin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> and dynorphin staining was significantly elevated in the central nucleus of the amygdala ipsilateral to the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These neurochemical changes are discussed as possible mechanisms mediating the cardiac and autonomic consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or as part of a process to provide neuro-protection following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
