<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are pathophysiological hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> still unamenable to therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contact-kinin system represents an interface between inflammatory and thrombotic circuits and is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C1-inhibitor counteracts activation of the contact-kinin system at multiple levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the therapeutic potential of C1-inhibitor in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female C57Bl/6 mice and rats of different ages were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with C1-inhibitor after 1 hour or 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and functional outcomes were assessed between day 1 and day 7, and findings were validated by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier damage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and the local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> were determined poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with 15.0 U C1-inhibitor, but not 7.5 U, 1 hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by â‰ˆ60% and improved clinical scores in mice of either sex on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This protective effect was preserved at later stages of infarction as well as in elderly mice and in another species, ie, rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed C1-inhibitor treatment still improved clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were significantly lower compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, C1-inhibitor showed strong antithrombotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: C1-inhibitor is a multifaceted antiinflammatory and antithrombotic compound that protects from ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in clinically meaningful settings </plain></SENT>
