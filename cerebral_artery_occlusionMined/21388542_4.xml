<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective efficacy of FTY720 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in two different application paradigms and to gather first data on the effect of FTY720 on the rate of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in C57BL/6 mice (strain J, groups of 10 animals) was performed with two different durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (90 min and 3 h) and FTY720 was applied 2 h after vessel occlusion to study the impact of reperfusion on the protective potency of FTY720 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was determined by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with FTY720 or vehicle were sacrificed 48 h after 90 min MCAO to determine the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> burden in lung and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FTY720 1 mg/kg significantly reduced ischemic lesion size when administered 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO for 3 h (45.4 ± 22.7 mm3 vs. 84.7 ± 23.6 mm3 in control mice, p = 0.001) and also when administered after reperfusion, 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO for 90 min (31.1 ± 28.49 mm3 vs. 69.6 ± 27.2 mm3 in control mice, p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> burden of lung homogenates 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not increase in the group treated with the immunomodulator FTY720 while there was no spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> 48 h after MCAO in treated and untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate the experimental evidence of the protective effect of FTY720 seen in different rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found no increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung infections</z:e> even though FTY720 strongly reduces the number of circulating leukocytes </plain></SENT>
