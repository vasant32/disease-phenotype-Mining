<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rats were randomly devided into sham, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and L-NA treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was prepared with thread embolism in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>L-NA was administrated respectively at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed and the mitochondria of cerebral tissue were isolated by differential centrifugation after L-NA treatment for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The swelling and the activity of mitochondria, and the activities of ATPase, SOD, GSH-Px in mitochondria and the contents of NO, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in mitochondria were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructure changes of neuronal mitochondria were examined by electronic microscope in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and L-NA treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The swelling of mitochondria was markedly increased and the activity of mitochondria was decreased, and the contents of mitochondria NO and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> were markedly increased, the activity of ATPase, SOD and GSH-Px in mitochondria were decreased significantly after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, the contents of NO were decreased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 2h, 6h, 12h administered by L-NA, and the swelling of mitochondria was decreased and the activity of mitochondria was increased, and the activities of ATPase, SOD, GSH-Px in mitochondria were enhanced and the contents of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in mitochondria were decreased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 12 h administered by L-NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuronal cytoplasm and the mitochondria swelled, the cristae were disrupted, dissolved or disappeared in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of L-NA could reduce these changes induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that L-NA could beneficially inhibit NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But it could't protect brain against damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It could improve mitochondria energy pump, ameliorate oxidative injury and increase the activities of mitochondria during postischemia, and then could effectively protect brain against damage induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
