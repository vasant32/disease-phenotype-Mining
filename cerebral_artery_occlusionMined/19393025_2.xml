<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that both the type of afferent connection, i.e., glutamatergic and/or GABAergic, and local cytoarchitecture, determined the effect MCAO had on metabolic activity in the non-ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was primarily excitatory input into non-ischemic regions that was affected by MCAO, perhaps enabling resetting of the excitatory/inhibitory balance, aiding reshaping of the receptive fields and thus facilitating recovery </plain></SENT>
