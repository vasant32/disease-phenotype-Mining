<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dye quenching assays showed that a hydrophobic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein (DAF), interacted with and was loaded into the hydrophobic core of the micelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-loaded R3V6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> micelles (R3V6-Dexa) were evaluated as a gene carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R3V6-Dexa had higher gene delivery efficiency in human embryonic kidney 293 cells compared to those of the R3V6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> might stabilize the micelle structure of the R3V6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> by forming strong hydrophobic cores and enhanced the transfection efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, R3V6-Dexa reduced the expression of an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), more efficiently in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced Raw264.7 cells than did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, suggesting that R3V6-Dexa is also a useful carrier for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion model was produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression plasmid DNA, pSV-HO-1, was delivered into the brain using R3V6-Dexa as a carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pSV-HO-1/R3V6-Dexa complex was injected into the brain 1hr prior to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the HO-1 expression of the pSV-HO-1/R3V6-Dexa injection group was higher than those of the MCAO control, pÎ²-Luc/R3V6-Dexa, and pSV-HO-1/PEI25k injection groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced due to the delivery of pSV-HO-1/R3V6-Dexa complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, R3V6-Dexa may be a useful carrier for HO-1 gene delivery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> gene therapy </plain></SENT>
