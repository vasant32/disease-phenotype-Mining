<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to elucidate the cellular/biochemical pathway(s) by which interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) contributes to the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo, IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI)-deficient mice showed smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and less neurological deficits than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals after a 90 min reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IL-1beta mediated an enhancement of hypoxic neuronal injury in murine cortical cultures that was lacking in cultures derived from IL-1RI null mutant animals and was blocked by the IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or an IL-1RI blocking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This IL-1beta-mediated potentiation of hypoxic neuronal injury was associated with an increase in both cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi> uptake ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>]i) and extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels ([<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>]e) and was prevented by either ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor antagonism or removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16283,50058">L-cystine</z:chebi>, suggesting a role for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> antiporter (System x(c)-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, dual System x(c)-/metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor subunit 1 (mGluR1) antagonism but not selective mGluR1 antagonism prevented neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cultures derived from mGluR1-deficient mice exhibited the same potentiation in injury after treatment with IL-1beta as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cultures, an effect prevented by System x(c)-/mGluR1 antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, assessment of System x(c)- function and kinetics in IL-1beta-treated cultures revealed an increase in velocity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi> transport (Vmax), in the absence of a change in affinity (Km) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the enhancement in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>]i, [<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>]e, or neuronal injury were observed in chimeric cultures consisting of IL-1RI(+/+) neurons plated on top of IL-1RI(-/-) astrocytes, highlighting the importance of astrocyte-mediated alterations in System x(c)- as a novel contributor to the development and progression of hypoxic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
