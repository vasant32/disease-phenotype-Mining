<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro synaptosomal neurotransmitter uptake, water content (specific gravity), and histopathology at the light and electron microscopic level were studied and the results compared with those obtained at deeper, critical levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (less than 15 ml 100 g-1 min-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[3H]4-Aminobutyric acid uptake was 104% of control in the marginal gyrus (NS), and 61 and 48% (p less than 0.05) in critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that impairment of in vivo synaptosomal uptake is a marker of simultaneous widespread damage to neurones, rather than of a change restricted to the synaptic compartment, although the present findings cannot exclude reversible, substrate-limited impairment of uptake in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reductions in specific gravity were seen only with critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 6 experiments, early or classical ischaemic neuronal cell changes and reactive glia were seen on light microscopy in restricted areas in the marginal gyrus, either in microfoci or scattered more diffusely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes were more frequent but were considered to affect only a minority of neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypotheses for selective electrophysiological suppression in penumbra are discussed </plain></SENT>
