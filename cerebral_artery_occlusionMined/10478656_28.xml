<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In noncerebral vascular systems, VEGF can induce endothelial integrin alpha(v)beta3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether VEGF, like integrin alpha(v)beta3, appears in the initial response of microvessels to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their coordinate expression in microvessels of the basal ganglia after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the nonhuman primate model was examined quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells incorporating deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>+) by the polymerase I reaction at 1 hour (n = 3), 2 hours (n = 3), and 7 days (n = 4) after MCAO defined the ischemic core (Ic) and peripheral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both VEGF and integrin alpha(v)beta3 were expressed by activated noncapillary (7.5- to 30.0-microm diameter) microvessels in the Ic region at 1 and 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 7 days after MCAO, the number of VEGF+, integrin alpha(v)beta3+, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive microvessels had decreased within the Ic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of VEGF, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were highly correlated on the same microvessels using hierarchical log-linear statistical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, VEGF and subunit alpha(v) messenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">ribonucleic acids</z:chebi> were coexpressed on selected microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, noncapillary microvessels are activated specifically early during a focal cerebral ischemic insult and rapidly express VEGF and integrin alpha(v)beta3 together </plain></SENT>
