<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of (S)-emopamil on the histopathologic consequences of permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three treatment protocols, intraperitoneal (S)-emopamil therapy was begun either 30 minutes prior to, immediately after, or 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in nontreated and saline-treated control rats were 85 +/- 22 and 66 +/- 19 mm3 (mean +/- SD), respectively, and did not differ statistically from one another </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the neocortex, striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was not altered by (S)-emopamil treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate the marked therapeutic efficacy of (S)-emopamil in focal cortical infarction, even when treatment is delayed for 1 hour following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
