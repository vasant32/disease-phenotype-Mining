<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> triggers increased progenitor proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the generation of medium spiny neurons in the damaged striatum of rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether intrastriatal infusion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult rats were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GDNF was infused into the ischemic striatum either during the first week after MCAO, with the animals being killed directly thereafter, or during the third and fourth weeks, with the rats being killed 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New cells were labeled with 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) on day 7 or during the second week, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis was assessed immunocytochemically with antibodies against BrdU and neuronal, glial, or progenitor markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GDNF receptor expression was analyzed in SVZ tissue and neurospheres by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GDNF infusion <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> in the ipsilateral SVZ and the recruitment of new neuroblasts into the striatum after MCAO and improved survival of new mature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GDNF receptor GFRalpha1 was upregulated in the SVZ 1 week after MCAO and was coexpressed with markers of dividing progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrastriatal infusion of GDNF in the postischemic period promotes several steps of striatal neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, partly through direct action on SVZ progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because delivery of GDNF has biological effects in the human brain, our data suggest that administration of this factor may promote neuroregenerative responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
