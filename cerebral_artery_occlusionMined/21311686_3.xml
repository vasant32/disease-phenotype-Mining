<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing number of reports demonstrate that VPA is neuroprotective against various insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite intensive efforts to develop new therapeutics for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> over the past two decades, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatments have thus far failed to show clinical effect because of treatment-limiting side effects of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a safety-validated drug like VPA would be an attractive candidate if it has neuroprotective effects against ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine whether pre- and post-insult treatments with VPA protect against brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and neurological deficits in mouse transient (tMCAO) and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the tMCAO (2 hr MCAO and 22 hr reperfusion) model, intraperitoneal injection of VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to MCAO significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VPA treatment immediately after reperfusion significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administration of VPA at 4 hr after reperfusion failed to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the pMCAO model, treatment with VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to MCAO significantly attenuated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, but did not affect the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of acetylated H3 and H4 protein levels in extracts from the ischemic cortical area showed that treatment with VPA increased the expression of acetylated H3 and H4 at 2 hrs after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that treatment with VPA prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> attenuated ischemic brain damage in both mice tMCAO and pMCAO models and treatment with VPA immediately after reperfusion reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in the tMCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VPA could therefore be evaluated for clinical use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
