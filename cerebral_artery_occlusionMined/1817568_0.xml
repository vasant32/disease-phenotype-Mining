<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SPECT instrument used was a brain dedicated highly sensitive four-camera system (TOMOMATIC 232) that allows to keep the radioactivity dose per study at 10 mCi (370 MBq) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler and angiography showed spontaneous disappearance of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> between days 5 and 8, while CBF showed reperfusion of the borderzone with flow increasing over several days after resolution of the occlusion with flows reaching levels above that of the opposite non-affected side ("Luxury Perfusion") </plain></SENT>
