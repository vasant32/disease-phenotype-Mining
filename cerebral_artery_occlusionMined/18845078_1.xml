<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transplantation on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the brain post focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operated group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group, vehicle group and MCAO+ADSC-treated group (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A permenant focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established with the modified Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADSC were labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One day after right MCAO, 30 muL of cell suspension containing 1x10(6) cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of MCAO+ADSC-treated group and the same dose of PBS was given to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On D4, D7 and D14 after MCAO, the rats were killed to detect the regeneration of microvessel and the expression of bFGF and VEGF in ischemic region by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A lot of microvessel proliferate in the injured cortex reached peak in 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The microvessel density in the brain tissues of rats treated with ADSC was higher than that in MCAO group and vehicle group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of bFGF and VEGF in the brain tissues of MCAO+ADSC-treated group was higher than that in MCAO group and vehicle group on D4, D7 and D14 post MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC can promote the revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats partly by enhancing bFGF and VEGF synthesis in brain </plain></SENT>
