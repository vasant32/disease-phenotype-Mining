<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, this study confirmed the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> in focal cerebral ischemic injury and investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> modulates a crucial survival pathway, Akt and its downstream targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg) 2h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24h after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">Nicotinamide</z:chebi> significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential activation was measured by phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser(241), Akt at Ser(473), and Bad at Ser(136) using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">Nicotinamide</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decrease of pPDK1, pAkt, and pBad levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>14-3-3 levels were not different between vehicle- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, pBad and 14-3-3 interaction levels decreased during MCAO, but were maintained in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi>, compared to levels in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> attenuates cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to focal cerebral ischemic injury and that neuroprotective effects are mediated through the Akt signaling pathway, thus enhancing neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
