<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the use of a new MMP activatable probe MMPSenseâ„¢ 750 FAST (MMPSense750) for in-vivo visualization of early MMP activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) optical imaging was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent images of MMPSense activation were acquired using an Olympus fluorescent microscope, 1.25 x objective, a CCD camera and an appropriate filter cube for detecting the activated probe with peak excitation and emission at 749 and 775 nm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were acquired starting at 2 or 24 hours after reperfusion over the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex before and for 3 hours after, MMPSense750 was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased intensities ipsilaterally were observed following MMPSense750 injection with ischemic injury but not in sham animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant ipsilateral and contralateral differences at 15 minutes (P &lt;0.05) in early ischemic reperfusion and at time 0 in 24 hours post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt;0.05) which persisted at 180 minutes in both these groups (P &lt;0.01), but not following sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in ipsilateral signal intensity was attenuated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations corresponded with a significant increase in the total MMP-9 protein levels, 5 and 24 hours following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion (P &lt;0.05) and their reduction by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Matrix-metalloproteinase upregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion can be imaged acutely in-vivo with NIRF using MMPSense750 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> attenuated both the optical increase in intensity after MMPSense750 and the increase in MMP-9 protein expression supporting the proof of concept that NIRF imaging using MMPSense can be used to assess potential therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
