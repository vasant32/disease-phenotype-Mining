<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes measured by 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 72 h after 2 h of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether improvement is found in both behavioral measures of protection and by histological measures of infarcted tissue at 7 and 14 days after 2 h rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg) was given once by intravenous injection 1 h after reperfusion, i.e. 3 h after initiation of rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral deficits were evaluated daily for 1 week or 2 weeks followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measurements by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi>-treated rats had significantly improved neurobehavioral deficit scores when evaluated daily throughout the 1 week or 2 week periods and showed significantly reduced median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured after 1 week and 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> values were 149 mm3 (interquartile range, IQR: 92 to 258) and 124 mm3 (IQR: 69 to 174) for the 1 and 2 week vehicle groups, respectively, compared with 5 mm3 (IQR: 3 to 16) and 4 mm3 (IQR: 0 to 48) for the comparable treated groups (both P &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test), giving a reduction of more than 90% in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a single administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> given 3 h after initiation of rMCAo is extremely effective in producing long-term neuroprotection as assessed by neurobehavioral measures and histopathology in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If these results are extrapolatable to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, these data indicate that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> may be a useful neuroprotectant </plain></SENT>
