<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of willed movement on the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and synaptophysin (SYP) in adult rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion, and explore the mechanism of willed movement in promoting nerve repair and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury were established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h followed by a 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The models were then divided randomly into 3 groups, namely the model group, environmental modification (EM) group, and willed movement (WM) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each group, neurological deficits were evaluated at 3, 7 and 15 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay were employed to examine the expression of GFAP and SYP in the brain tissue near the ischemic foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rats in WM group showed lessened neurological deficits at 15 days and lowered expression of GFAP and SYP at 7 and 15 days after reperfusion compared with the model and EM groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the expression of GFAP or SYP between the model group and EM group at any time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Willed movement can promote the functional recovery of neurological deficits following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion probably in relation to enhanced GFAP and SYP expressions in the ischemic brain tissues </plain></SENT>
