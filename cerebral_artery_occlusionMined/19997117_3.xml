<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 (HSP27tg) to examine the role of HSP27 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, using model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of 30% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was detected in HSP27tg animals compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To gain some insight into the mechanisms contributing to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and its attenuation by HSP27, we monitored the effect of induction of c-jun and ATF3 on tissue survival in MCAO and their effects on the expression of endogenous mouse HSP25 and HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important that, the c-jun induction seen at 4 h tended to be localized to regions that were salvageable in HSP27tg mice but became infarcted in WT animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results provide support for the powerful neuroprotective effects of HSP27 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
