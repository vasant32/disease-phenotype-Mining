<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) have the potential to migrate into the injured neural tissue and to differentiate into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> cells, indicating the possibility of autograft transplantation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to clarify whether the mouse BMSC can migrate into the lesion and differentiate into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> cells when transplanted into the mice subjected to focal cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BMSC were harvested from mice and characterized by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, the BMSC were labeled by bis-benzimide, a nuclear fluorescence dye, over 24 h, and were stereotactically transplanted into the brain or spinal cord of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cultured BMSC expressed low levels of CD45 and high levels of CD90 and Sca-1 on flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large number of grafted cells survived in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain 4 weeks after transplantation, many of which were located close to the transplanted sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They expressed the neuronal marker including NeuN, MAP2, and doublecortin on fluorescent immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the BMSC were transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, many of the grafted cells migrated into the corpus callosum and injured cortex, and also expressed the neuronal markers 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, NeuN was very useful to validate the differentiation of the grafted cells, because the marker was expressed in the nuclei and was overlapped with bis-benzimide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the mice subjected to spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, many of the transplanted BMSC expressed GFAP, an astrocytic protein, in injured spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that the mouse BMSC can migrate into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesion and differentiate into the neurons or astrocytes, and that bis-benzimide is a simple and useful marker to label the donor cells and to evaluate their migration and differentiation in the host neural tissues over a long period </plain></SENT>
