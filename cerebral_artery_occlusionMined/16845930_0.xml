<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect is manifested by positive changes in the parameters describing the behavior of animals in elevated plus maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No tolerance to the drug is developed during continuous afobazole injection within 12 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
