<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interstrain differences in the temporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats may considerably influence the results of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated, in 2 commonly used rat strains (Sprague-Dawley [SD] and Wistar-Kyoto [WK]), the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after permanent suture MCAO using diffusion and perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were performed up to 210 min after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were calculated by using previously established viability thresholds and correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume defined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-derived lesion volume increased rapidly during the first 120 min after MCAO and essentially stopped growing after 3 hours in SD rats, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion in WK rats increased progressively during the entire 210-min period and was significantly smaller at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal perfusion volume correlated highly with the TTC-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In WK rats, the abnormal perfusion volume was significantly larger than the abnormal diffusion volume up to 90 min after MCAO (P&lt;0.001), whereas the diffusion/perfusion mismatch was significant (P&lt;0.001) only at 45 min in SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-CBF scatterplots analysis revealed a slower and less robust <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decline over time in WK rats in pixels with severe (&lt;20% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) and moderate (21 to 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated substantial differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion evolution between SD and WK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These interstrain variations must be taken into account when assessing new therapeutic approaches on ischemic lesion evolution in the rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
