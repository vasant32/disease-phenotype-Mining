<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study and in situ hybridization showed that the expression of VEGF and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was enhanced in the ischemic core and penumbra of ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis further illustrated that VEGF induction was time-dependently changed in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-staining analysis indicated that VEGF-positive staining existed in the neuron, but not in the glia, and it colocalized with excision repair cross-complementing group 6 (ERCC6) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, a DNA repair factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEGF antisense oligodeoxynucleotide infusion reduced VEGF induction and resulted in an enlargement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the brain caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it also increased the number of DNA damaged cells and lessened the induction of ERCC6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the induction of endogenous VEGF in ischemic neurons plays a neuroprotective role probably associated with the expression of ERCC6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
