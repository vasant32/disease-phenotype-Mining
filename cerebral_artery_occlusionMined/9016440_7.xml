<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and reperfusion (120 min), previous studies have demonstrated that hemodilution with molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> decreases ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term recovery data on the therapeutic efficacy of molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we assessed the effect of hemodilution, with alpha-alpha diaspirin cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (DCLHb, 10 g/dl) on neurologic outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 120 min of MCAo and 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was achieved by passing a 0.26-mm suture, via the external carotid artery, to internally occlude the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after MCAo, the rats were randomized to one of the following groups: Control-hematocrit not manipulated (44%); 30/Hct-hematocrit maintained at 30% with DCLHb; or 16/Hct-hematocrit maintained at 16% with DCLHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 120 min of MCAo, the suture was removed and the rats allowed to recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daily neurologic examinations were performed, and after 72 h, the brains were analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume with TTC stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume (mm3) was less in the 30/Hct group (67 +/- 10; mean +/- SD) than in the Control group (141 +/- 17); and less in the 16/Hct group (40 +/- 12) than the other two groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcome was improved in both hemodilution groups versus the Control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with previous studies, performed in a model of short-term reperfusion, which indicate a dose-dependent decrease in ischemic injury by DCLHb </plain></SENT>
