<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The influence of noopept (N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, GVS-111) on the extent of ischemic cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was investigated in experiments on white mongrel male rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by a combination of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with ipsilateral common carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with noopept (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) according to the following schedule: 15 min and 2, 24, and 48 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Test rats were decapitated 72 h after occlusion, brains were extracted and frozen, and thin brain slices were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slices were scanned and processed using Auc 1 computer program, which estimates the percentage of damaged area relative to that of the whole ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditions of coagulation the distal segment of middle cerebral artery were selected, which caused <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> localized in the fronto-parietal and dorso-lateral regions of the brain cortex without any damage of subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of the brain damage in control group (treated by saline) was 18.6%, while that in the group treated with noopept was 12.2%, thus demonstrating a decrease in the infarction area by 34.5% (p &lt; 05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data on noopept efficacy on the model of the extensive ischemic injury of brain cortex show that this drug has good prospects for use in the neuroprotective treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
