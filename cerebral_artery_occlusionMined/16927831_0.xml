<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rats was established by ligation of the left internal carotid artery for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> with different doses (23.5, 47 and 94 micromol x kg(-1)) for three days before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain sections were collected after 1 , 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h of reperfusion, neuronal injury in the boundary zone of the infarction area was evaluated by TUNEL and Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of activated Caspase-3, total SAPK/JNK, p38MAPK and their phosphorylation (Thr183/Tyr185, Thr180/Tyr182) was investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting with corresponding antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although SAPK/JNK immunoreactivity did not increase at each time point in the boundary zone of the infarction area after reperfusion, p-SAPK/JNK immunoreactivity increased significantly at 1 h and then decreased gradually, and p38MAPK immunoreactivity was enhanced at each time point, peaked at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of p-p38MAPK peaked at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Activated Caspase-3 immunoreactivity appeared at 6 h in the boundary zone of the infarction area and peaked at 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TUNEL positive neurons were observed at 12 h and became more abundant at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of Nissl positive neurons decreased gradually and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> ratio of neurons peaked at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">Propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> reduced the immunoreactivity of SAPK/JNK, p-SAPK/JNK, p38MAPK and p-p38MAPK markedly at 1 and 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">Propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> with doses of 47 and 94 micromol x kg(-1) were more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inhibition on the activation of SAPK/JNK and p38MAPK is the possible protective mechanism of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> against neuronal injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
