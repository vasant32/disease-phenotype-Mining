<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compare the cerebral macro- and microvascular architecture of rats in two different models of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an innovative quantitative micro- and nano-CT imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 4h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in rats using the macrosphere method or the suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After contrast perfusion, brains were isolated and scanned en-bloc using micro-CT (8 mum)3 or nano-CT at 500 nm3 voxel size to generate 3D images of the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial vascular volume fraction and gray scale attenuation was determined and the significance of differences in measurements was tested with analysis of variance [ANOVA] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Micro-CT provided quantitative information on vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Micro- and nano-CT proved to visualize and differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> territories performed in both models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The suture technique leads to a remarkable decrease in the intravascular volume fraction of the middle cerebral artery perfusion territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blocking the medial cerebral artery with macrospheres, the vascular volume fraction of the involved hemisphere decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001), independently of the number of macrospheres, and was comparable to the suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We established gray scale measurements by which focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could be radiographically categorized (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nano-CT imaging demonstrates collateral perfusion related to different occluded vessel territories after macrosphere perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Micro- and Nano-CT imaging is feasible for analysis and differentiation of different models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
