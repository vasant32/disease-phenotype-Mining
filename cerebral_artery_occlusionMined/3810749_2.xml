<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the bilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in 17 cats, 5 with a 1-hour occlusion, 5 with a 4-hour occlusion, and 7 with a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time course of cerebral tissue radioactivity (Ci*(t)) was monitored by external coincidence counting during a programmed infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">[18F]</z:chebi>-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-2-FDG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial plasma concentration (Cp*(t)) of the tracer was kept constant during the first 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rate constants were estimated from Ci*(t) and Cp*(t) by a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lumped constant was estimated from the fit of the ratio of extraction fractions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-2-FDG by nonweighted, nonlinear least-squares fitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 4-hour-occlusion model, the transfer constant k1* was 23% lower, k3* 39% lower, and the lumped constant 78% higher than in the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 1-hour-occlusion model, k3* was 26% lower than in the sham-operated animals but the lumped constant was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was significantly different in the 4-hour-occlusion model compared to the sham-operated animals (48% decrease, p less than 0.05) but was not significantly different in the 1-hour-occlusion model </plain></SENT>
