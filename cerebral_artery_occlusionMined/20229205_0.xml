<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Major cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> often resists recanalization with currently available techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present their initial experience with a self-expanding stent for use in intracranial vascular reconstruction, permitting immediate recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic occlusions of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with the Cordis Enterprise self-expanding intracranial stent system for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic occlusion of the major anterior cerebral arteries were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment comprised systemic and intraarterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stent deployment, recanalization rate by means of Thrombolysis In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> (TICI) scores and the clinical outcome were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid T (n = 2) or proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 4) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation was 14; the mean age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful stent deployment and immediate recanalization were achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six with a TICI score of &gt;/= 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither distal emboli nor any procedure-related complications were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and two patients needed decompressive craniectomy after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score at 10 days was 10, but only one patient showed a complete recovery at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial placement of the Enterprise self-expanding stent has proven to be feasible and efficient in achieving immediate recanalization of occluded main cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of antiplatelet therapy after treatment may, however, increase the risk of reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
