<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight male SD(Sprague-Dawley)rats were randomly separated into 4 groups according to body mass: Sham operation (SO), middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), MCAO + low dose <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (MCAO + LFA), and MCAO + high dose <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (MCAO + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HFA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was made by operation with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method except for SO, and the rats were executed at the 14th d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> contents were measured with immune chemiluminescence before and 28d after <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation and 14d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain tissues neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was measured with TUNEL method, Notch1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization at the 14th d after the rats with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with MCAO, the rates of neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were more lower, the concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and the fluorescence intensity of Notch1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were more higher than those in both MCAO + LFA and MCAO + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HFA</z:e> after FA supplementation (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rates of neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by FA associated with the increase of Notch1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
