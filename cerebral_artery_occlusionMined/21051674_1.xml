<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although in vitro studies suggest that non-neurogenic regions of the adult central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system potentially contain multipotent parenchymal progenitors, neurons are clearly not replaced in most brain regions after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, in a well-established model of mild transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, we explored Olig2 antagonism and Pax6 overexpression as potential avenues to redirect endogenous progenitors proliferating in situ toward a neuronal fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retroviral vectors containing either Pax6 or a strong activator form of the repressor Olig2 (Olig2VP16), ie, a functionally dominant negative form of Olig2, were stereotaxically injected into the lateral striatum at 48 hours after 30 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo)/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Retroviral modulation of fate determinants resulted in a significant number of infected cells differentiating into Doublecortin (DCX)-expressing immature neurons that were not observed after injection of a control virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain slices showed that the percentage of virus-infected cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents was increased by inhibition of the repressor function of Olig2 and by overexpression of Pax6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, on retroviral transduction of fate determinants, we detected newly generated cells within the ischemic lesion that were capable of generating single action potentials and that received synaptic input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data show that resident glia in the striatum can be reprogrammed toward functional neuronal differentiation following brain injury </plain></SENT>
