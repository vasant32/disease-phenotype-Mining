<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A flexible artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was developed and applied to predict ischemic tissue fate on three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups: 30-, 60-minute, and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and spin-spin relaxation time constant (T2) were acquired during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase up to 3 hours and again at 24 hours followed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> was predicted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (30-minute) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, neighboring pixel information and infarction incidence were also incorporated into the ANN model to improve prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to quantify prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major findings were the following: (1) CBF alone poorly predicted the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> across three experimental groups; (2) <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> alone adequately predicted the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; (3) CBF+<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> improved the prediction accuracy; (4) inclusion of neighboring pixel information and infarction incidence further improved the prediction accuracy; and (5) prediction was more accurate for permanent occlusion, followed by 60- and 30-minute occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ANN predictive model could thus provide a flexible and objective framework for clinicians to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment options on an individual patient basis </plain></SENT>
