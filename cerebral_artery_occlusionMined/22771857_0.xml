<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of Nogo-A protein, a myelin-associated inhibitor of axon regeneration, with secondary damage of the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO) in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone, renovascular hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular infusion of NEP1-40, a Nogo-66 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, or vehicle was administered starting 24h after dMCAO and continued for 1, 2, or 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of Nogo-A in the ipsilateral SNr was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated using Nissl and terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glial activation was monitored by immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein and the oligodendrocyte marker RIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage and regeneration were determined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e>'s silver staining and immunoreactivity of growth associated protein 43 and microtubule associated protein 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found progressive damage in the center of the ipsilateral SNr through 4 weeks after dMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was topographically related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> that occurred indirectly from the infarcted cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nogo-A protein in oligodendrocytes was persistently increased in the damaged SNr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of NEP1-40 inhibited Nogo-A expression, the loss of neurons, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and proliferation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also boosted the regenerative response of injured axons and encouraged compensatory neurite growth in the ipsilateral SNr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that secondary damage in the ipsilateral SNr may be due to trans-synaptic <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> that followed the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further, we showed that Nogo-A is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp>, and NEP1-40 reduces secondary nigral damage after focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
