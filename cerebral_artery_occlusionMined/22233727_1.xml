<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been well established that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and probucol could elicit a variety of biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was to examine whether probucol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in combination had the enhanced protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the time course expression of Peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) and Foxo3a after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 was used to detect neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and probucol in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24h or 72h, neurologic deficit, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscope were used to analyze the expressions of Prx2, Foxo3a and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-control group, the expressions of Prx2 and Foxo3a were down-regulated in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the use of probucol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> alone, the combined treatment dramatically reduced the brain water content and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the decrease of Prx2, Foxo3a and Nrf2 was significantly alleviated in combined treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Probucol combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> can get the augmented neuroprotection from the damage caused by MCAO, this effect may be through up-regulation of Prx2, Foxo3a and Nrf2 </plain></SENT>
