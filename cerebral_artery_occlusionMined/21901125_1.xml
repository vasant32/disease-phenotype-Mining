<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prevention study: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) were subjected to high salt and randomly assigned to 4 groups: (1) untreated (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, n = 24), (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> (T; n = 27), (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> (R; n = 27) and (4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> (T+R; n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug doses were selected to keep blood pressure (BP) at 150 mmHg in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological signs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence at 50% mortality of untreated SHR-SP were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention study: Normotensive Wistar rats were treated s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 days prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Groups (n = 10 each): (1) sham, (2) vehicle (V; 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>), (3) T (0.5 mg/kg once daily), (4) R (0.01 mg/kg twice daily), (5) R (0.1 mg/kg twice daily) or (6) T (0.5 mg/kg once daily) plus R (0.01 mg/kg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four and 48 h after MCAO, neurological outcome (NO) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight h after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by MRI, neuronal survival, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> factors and neurotrophin receptor (TrkB) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence was reduced, survival was prolonged and neurological outcome was improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated SHR-SP with no differences between treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intervention study, T and T+R, but not R alone, improved NO, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (TNFα), and induced TrkB receptor and neuronal survival in comparison to V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T, R or T+R had similar beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and NO in hypertensive rats, confirming BP reduction as determinant factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, T and T+R provided superior neuroprotection in comparison to R alone in normotensive rats with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
