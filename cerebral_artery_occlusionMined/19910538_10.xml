<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography studies using the steady-state (15)O-gas inhalation method were performed to quantify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> metabolism, which was compared based on the infarction extent and immunohistochemical evaluation in 19 monkeys undergoing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (3 h), infusion of various LEH doses (n = 11), empty liposome (n = 4), or saline (n = 4) 5 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and reperfusion for 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> metabolism until 3 h after reperfusion, when the cerebral metabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> (CMRO(2)) was significantly less suppressed in the cortex [mild suppression in CMRO(2) (71-100%) of preischemic ipsilateral control as in the ischemic penumbra: 64.7 +/- 14.3% in empty liposome versus 32.4 +/- 7.9% in LEH (2 ml/kg) treatment, P &lt; 0.05] but not in basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed a reciprocal expression of microtubular-associated protein II expression in the cortex and LEH deposition in basal ganglia, suggesting the LEH perfusion, but not deposition, afforded the protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-response studies revealed that as little as 0.4 ml/kg LEH (24 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) was effective in preserving CMRO(2), whereas 2 and 10 ml/kg were protective in significantly reducing the area of infarction as well, by 66 and 56%, respectively, compared with animals receiving saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMRO(2) and histological integrity were better preserved early after 3-h occlusion and reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery of monkeys receiving LEH early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
