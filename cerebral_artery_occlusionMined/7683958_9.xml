<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological staining and immunohistochemical markers were used to characterize the temporal progression of the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed at different days after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 3 days after MCAO, an extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the cerebral parenchyma was accompanied by extravasation and by massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, GFAP marker showed a gliotic reaction with alteration of the astrocytes membrane permeability (S100 marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity for acid phosphatase staining indicated the presence of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At Day 14 and 21 following MCAO, the histological profile was essentially similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, at Day 7, 14 and 21, a previously unreported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> was observed in the subthalamic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis showed a significantly large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at Day 3 (7.88 +/- 1.95 mm3 +/- S.E.M.) compared to Day 7 (4.28 +/- 0.47 mm3 +/- S.E.M.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At Day 14 and Day 21 the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were further decreased to 2.00 +/- 0.52 and 1.43 +/- 0.39 mm3 +/- S.E.M., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it is important to consider the time of evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>-induced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, especially in studies which aim to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of putative therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
