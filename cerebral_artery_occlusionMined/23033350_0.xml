<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our goal was to compare outcomes of patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with those of patients treated with stent-based thrombectomy (SBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> included in our prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> defined as National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score≥10 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with tPA were compared with those treated with SBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disability was measured with the modified Rankin Scale and shifts toward favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale≤2) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine outcome modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 22 patients treated with SBT and 66 treated with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with SBT had higher admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores (median 21 vs 14.5; P&lt;0.001) and prolonged symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-treatment times (median 240 vs 95 minutes; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At discharge, the magnitude of change in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was larger in the thrombectomy group (median 12 vs 6 points; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 90 days poststroke there was a shift toward favorable outcome in the thrombectomy group (60% vs 37.5%; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment allocation did not impact outcome in the regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> with SBT resulted in a shift toward more favorable outcomes compared with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled studies are needed to explore whether treatment with SBT should be used in patients presenting within the first hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
