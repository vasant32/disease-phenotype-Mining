<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, assessment of sensorimotor performance has become increasingly important in neuroprotective drug research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, contradictions exist about procedures for testing functional outcome following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate a relatively simple set of neurological tests based on the most commonly used scoring systems, and to describe the functional recovery and correlation with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in rats sacrificed 2 or 14 days after permanent or transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of rats with transient occlusion was reflected in the neurological scores only during the first 6h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By day 14, no recovery occurred in postural signs, lateral resistance and spontaneous activity, other signs showed different degrees of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was found only on certain days in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, placing reactions, daily body weight and spontaneous activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to our observations, the most commonly used sensorimotor tests provide a useful initial screening of functional deficits, but these tests most probably measure deficits caused by infarction of the core area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that these tests should be completed by more refined tests when testing a neuroprotective drug which reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in penumbral areas </plain></SENT>
