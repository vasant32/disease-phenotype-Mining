<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning describes a phenomenon whereby a sub-injury inducing insult can protect against a later larger injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can protect against a prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (ischemic preconditioning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines rats undergoing ischemic preconditioning to test whether preconditioning may cause changes in behavior even though they do not cause an identifiable brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats had a transient (15 minutes) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or a sham occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forelimb placing and forelimb use asymmetry tests were used to assess behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain histology, microglia activation, heat shock protein and ferritin levels were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning did not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between ischemic preconditioning and sham rats in the two behavioral tests at day one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the ischemic preconditioning group showed impaired forelimb placing at days 3, 7 and 14 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That group also had a significant (p&lt;0.05) behavioral deficit in the forelimb use asymmetry test at days 3 and 7 (but not 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our present study demonstrated that a behavioral deficit occurred in ischemic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of whether induction of protective mechanisms by preconditioning stimuli necessarily involves some form of brain injury, detectable by changes in behavior though not by a lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This would be consistent with data suggesting that brain injury can initiate mechanisms potentially favorable to neuroplasticity and neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
