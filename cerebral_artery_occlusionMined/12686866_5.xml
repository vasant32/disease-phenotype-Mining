<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The maintenance of long lasting bladder overactivity caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is believed to require transcription in the pontine micturition center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the influence of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> (Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) on bladder overactivity induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>) into the bilateral dorsal pontine tegmentum, followed by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Awake rats were cystometrically examined for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-fos and zif268 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the dorsal pontine tegmentum was monitored with real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> produced a significant decrease in bladder capacity in sham operated rats but bladder capacity returned to control levels before sham operation within 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cerebral infarcted rats pretreated with vehicle bladder capacity was significantly decreased after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and it remained consistently below half of pre-occlusion capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">Actinomycin D</z:chebi> blocked the decrease in bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> treated cerebral infarcted rats bladder capacity gradually recovered and returned to the control level before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> within 10 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">Actinomycin D</z:chebi> suppressed an increase in c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as well as in zif268 3 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> 0.5 or 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> also suppressed bladder overactivity until at least 10 hours after occlusion but injection 3 hours after occlusion did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor can prevent a late stage of bladder overactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcription in the dorsal pontine tegmentum was found to be necessary to maintain the long lasting bladder overactivity caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
