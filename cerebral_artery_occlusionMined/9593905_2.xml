<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared in Wistar rats collateral blood flow through leptomeningeal anastomoses after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using craniotomy ('extravasal occlusion'), which results in a small volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and after intraluminal thread occlusion ('intravasal occlusion'), which produces a large volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry with two probes placed on the cerebral cortex was used to measure and compare collateral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extravasal occlusion caused a cortical blood flow reduction along a gradient in lateral direction, whereas blood flow reduction after intravasal occlusion was more uniformly distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that permanent intravasal occlusion compromises collateral blood flow and therefore may not be a suitable model for measuring the ability of pharmacotherapeutic agents, if any, to improve collateral blood flow acutely after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two models can be useful for testing drugs on parenchymal neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereby, the intraluminal technique is preferred because of the possibility to study reperfusion damage when transient occlusion is applied </plain></SENT>
