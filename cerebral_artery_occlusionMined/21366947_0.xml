<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty four male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group and the hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group, each n =8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral I/R model was reproduced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), followed by reperfusion after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group received hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 130/0.4206 ml × kg(-1)× d(-1) ia tail vein at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP and COP were evaluated at 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed by decapitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The water content of the right hemisphere was measured at 24 hours after the surgery, and the ratio of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neurons was observed by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hours after surgery the ICP (mm Hg, 1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) of model group and hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group was significantly increased compared with sham operation group (11.50 ± 1.43, 12.48 ± 0.75 vs. 7.95 ± 0.92, both P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With prolongation of time, the ICP gradually increased and reached the peak at 24 hours (22.76 ± 0.72, 23.32 ± 0.98 vs. 8.15 ± 1.09, both P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But there was no significant difference in ICP in the hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group compared with that of the model group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The COP (mm Hg) of hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group was significantly higher than the model group and sham operation group at each time point, and peaked at 6 hours after surgery (13.49 ± 0.50 vs. 12.04 ± 0.47, 12.00 ± 0.39, both P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in COP between the model group and the sham operation group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The brain water content, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group and model group was significantly higher than sham operation group [brain water content: (80.16 ± 0.44)%, (80.59 ± 0.67)% vs. (78.72 ± 0.52)%; neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>:(44.27 ± 7.86)%,(42.82 ± 7.82)%vs. (3.26 ± 0.00)%, P &lt;0.05 or P &lt;0.01], but there was no significant difference between the hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> group and model group (both P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous injection of hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 130/0.4 can increase the plasma COP, but it can not significantly reduce ICP and brain water content, and it also can not improve the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
