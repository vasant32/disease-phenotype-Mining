<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of rehabilitation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MCAO model was reproduced with two-kidney, two clip renovascular hypertensive rats <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone (RHRSP), which were divided into two groups, the treated group (treated with electric stimulus) and the control group (untreated model) randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rehabilitation of rats was evaluated by balance beam walking test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural changes of neurons and astrocytes, expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells, neurofilament (NF) protein, and cerebral capillary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> M-associated protein-2 (MAP2), as well as the neurons <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of cerebral capillary in the margin of infarcted area were observed by the end of 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th week after modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The motor function of paralysed limbs recovered better in the treated group than that in the control group by the end of 3-9th week after MCAO, the expression of GFAP-positive cells in astrocytes and NF, MAP2 in neurons as well as the number of cerebral capillary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at the margin of infarcted area were higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electric stimulation treatment could improve the recovery of motor function of paralyzed limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might be due to the effect of electric stimulus in increasing astrocytes proliferation, reinforcing activity of neurons and evoking the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of cerebral capillary </plain></SENT>
