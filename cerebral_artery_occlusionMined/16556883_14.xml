<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using diffusion and perfusion imaging, we compared the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in Sprague Dawley rats after permanent suture MCAO (sMCAO; n=8) and embolic MCAO (eMCAO; n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were performed up to 180 minutes after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF values within 5 different brain regions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF lesion volumes were calculated by using previously established viability thresholds and correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume defined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sMCAO animals, the threshold-derived CBF lesion volume was significantly larger in eMCAO at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&lt;0.01), remained relatively constant over time, and was highly correlated with the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume did not differ between models at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diffusion/perfusion mismatch was present significantly longer in eMCAO animals (P&lt;0.05), and these rats demonstrated larger absolute mismatch volumes that were statistically significant at 30, 60, and 90 minutes (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both models, CBF and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> declines were highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated substantial differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion evolution between the eMCAO and sMCAO models </plain></SENT>
