<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used an adaptation of a well-established rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) that is both minimally invasive and reproducible to determine the effects of time to reperfusion and administration of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) on the development of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomized to receive either t-PA 10 mg/kg (29 rats) or an equal volume of saline (29 rats) over 20 minutes, beginning 5 minutes before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time to artery reopening varied between 1 and 24 hours after MCAO in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 18-24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were preserved for analysis of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine the influence of time on HT risk and calculate the time at which 50% of animals developed HT (HT50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, HT was present in 17 of 29 animals in each group and was significantly influenced by the time of artery reopening: 3 (15%) of 20 animals reperfused less than 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 32 (84%) of 38 reperfused 3 or more hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in HT50% between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time to artery reopening is an important determinant of HT risk in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model may have utility in developing strategies to reduce HT formation after thrombolytic therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
