<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> is still unclear, it is now beyond doubt that body temperature influences the outcome of brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An elevated body temperature is often found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and denotes a bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the pathophysiologic basis and treatment options of elevated body temperature after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rapidly induced neuronal interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In IL-6-deficient mice, body temperature was markedly decreased after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was comparable to that in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If body temperature was controlled by external warming after MCAO, IL-6-deficient mice had a reduced survival, worse neurologic status, and larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cell culture, IL-6 exerted an antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IL-6 is a key regulator of body temperature and an endogenous neuroprotectant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective properties apparently compensate for its pyretic action after MCAO and enhance the safety of this endogenous pyrogen </plain></SENT>
