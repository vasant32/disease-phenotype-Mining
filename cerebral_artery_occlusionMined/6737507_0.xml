<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteriograms showed distal filling of the occluded <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, but no collateral blood flow from the carotid circulation, suggesting collateral flow from leptomeningeal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visual field sparing may occur in surgical occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, but rarely occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An infarction from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion is not excluded by complete visual field sparing, and studies looking for other causes of the neurologic deficit may not be necessary </plain></SENT>
