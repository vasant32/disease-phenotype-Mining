<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bcl-w is a newly described cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> suppressor member of the Bcl-2 gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these genes may have a role in the outcome of ischemic brain injury, the regional expression of Bcl-w protein in rat brain was examined at 6 to 72 hours after 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-w protein, although constitutively expressed at low levels in nonischemic brain, was found to be overexpressed in ischemic brain at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of Bcl-w protein was particularly abundant in the penumbral region of the cortex and mainly in cells lacking DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cortical penumbra, Bcl-w protein was detected predominantly in neurons and showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> localization, as determined using double-label immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-w expression was also detectable, to a lesser extent, in reactive astrocytes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone and in microvessel walls in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the mechanistic level, incubation of isolated brain mitochondria with the addition of recombinant Bax or high concentration of calcium resulted in release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> from the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of recombinant Bcl-w protein, however, the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> induced by Bax or calcium was largely inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, recombinant Bcl-w protein inhibited calcium-induced loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential, indicative of permeability transition, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Bcl-w may be an endogenous neuroprotectant against ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and that, like its analogues such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x-long, Bcl-w may achieve this protection via the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-regulatory pathway </plain></SENT>
