<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2alpha) has been implicated in the progression of cerebral injury following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in rodents suggest that cPLA2alpha enhances delayed injury extension and disruption of the blood brain barrier many hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the role of cPLA2alpha in early ischemic cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed on cPLA2alpha+/+ and cPLA2alpha-/- mice for 2 hours followed by 0, 2, or 6 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of cPLA2alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and reactive oxygen species in the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were evaluated by light and fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> content was compared between genotypes and hemispheres after MCAO and MCAO and 6 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was measured during MCAO and phosphorylation of relevant MAPKs in brain protein homogenates was measured by Western analysis after 6 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuronal cPLA2alpha protein increased by 2-fold immediately after MCAO and returned to pre-MCAO levels after 2 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 induction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentration were greater in cPLA2alpha+/+ compared to cPLA2alpha-/- ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuronal swelling in ischemic regions was significantly greater in the cPLA2alpha+/+ than in cPLA2alpha-/- brains (+/+:2.2+/-0.3 fold vs. -/-:1.7+/-0.4 fold increase; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in reactive oxygen species following 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was also significantly greater in the cPLA2alpha+/+ ischemic core than in cPLA2alpha-/- (+/+:7.12+/-1.2 fold vs. -/-:3.1+/-1.4 fold; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 6 hours of reperfusion ischemic cortex of cPLA2alpha+/+, but not cPLA2alpha-/-, had disruption of neuron <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of the MAPKs-p38, ERK 1/2, and MEK 1/2-was significantly greater in cPLA2a+/+ than in cPLA2alpha-/- ischemic cortex 6 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cPLA2alpha modulates the earliest molecular and injury responses after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and have implications for the potential clinical use of cPLA2alpha inhibitors </plain></SENT>
