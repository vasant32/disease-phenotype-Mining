<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, bind to a membrane receptor complex composed of the type-1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) and the accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The discovery of new orphan members of the IL-1 receptor superfamily (including ST2/T1, IL-1Rrp2, TIGIRR1 and -2, SIGGIR, IL-18Ralpha and IL-18Rbeta) has increased speculation that alternative IL-1 ligands signalling pathways exist in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the IL-1R-like orphan receptors are expressed by many brain cell types including astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytic progenitor cells and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-18Rbeta expression was significantly increased in response to treatment of mixed glia with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) in vitro, whereas expression of IL-1Rrp2 and TIGIRR1 was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-18Rbeta, IL-1Rrp2, but not TIGIRR1 expression, was increased in the brain in vivo in response to peripheral administration of LPS or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest possible roles for newly identified members of the IL-1 receptor family in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> diseases </plain></SENT>
