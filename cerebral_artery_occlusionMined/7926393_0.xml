<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One common final pathway in neuronal ischemic damage is the uncontrolled influx of calcium into the cell, mediated by voltage dependent channels or activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl D-aspartate</z:chebi>) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic utility of a non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> blocker (MK-801, 2 mg/kg i.p.), to prevent the neuronal ischemic damage in an experimental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model has been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered 10 minutes before (group 3) and one hour after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (group 4), and the results were compared with a group in which no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52217">medicament</z:chebi> was utilized (group 2) and a control group (sham operation, group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK-801 reduced significantly the area of infarction in relation to the control group (p &lt; 0.05), mainly if the MK-801 was administered before the occlusion (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MK-801 may be useful for the prevention of the neuronal ischemic damage caused by focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, before recommending its use in humans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the possible collateral effects must be defined </plain></SENT>
