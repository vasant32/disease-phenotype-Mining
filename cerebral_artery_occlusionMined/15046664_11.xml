<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has long been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, which is currently being induced by whole-body surface cooling, has been limited primarily because of management problems and severe side effects (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether local infusion of saline into ischemic territory could induce regional brain cooling and neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A novel procedure was used to block the middle cerebral artery of rats for 3 hours with a hollow filament and locally infuse the middle cerebral artery-supplied territory with 6 ml cold saline (20 degrees C) for 10 minutes before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cold saline infusion rapidly and significantly reduced temperature in cerebral cortex from 37.2 +/- 0.1 to 33.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C and in striatum from 37.5 +/- 0.2 to 33.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> remained for up to 60 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant (P &lt; 0.01) reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (approximately 90%) were evident after 48 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ischemic rats that received the same amount of cold saline systemically through a femoral artery, a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced only in the cerebral cortex (35.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were observed in this group or in the ischemic group with local warm saline infusion or without infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, brain-cooling infusion significantly (P &lt; 0.01) improved motor behavior in ischemic rats after 14 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This improvement continued for up to 28 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local prereperfusion infusion effectively induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and ameliorated brain injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinically, this procedure could be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, possibly in combination with intra-arterial thrombolysis or mechanical disruption of clot by means of a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
