<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous study has demonstrated that the rapid tolerance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment was possibly mediated through an endocannabinoid system-related mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether activation of epsilon protein kinase C (εPKC) was involved in EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection via cannabinoid receptor type 1 in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The activation of εPKC in the ipsilateral brain tissues after EA pretreatment was investigated in the presence or absence of cannabinoid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 2 hours after the end of EA pretreatment, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 minutes in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were evaluated after reperfusion in the presence or absence of εPKC-selective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor (TAT-εV1-2) or activator (TAT-ψεRACK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EA pretreatment enhanced εPKC activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic delivery of TAT-ψεRACK conferred neuroprotection against a subsequent cerebral ischemic event when delivered 2 hours before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with EA reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, improved neurological outcome, inhibited neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and increased the Bcl-2-to-Bax ratio after reperfusion, and the beneficial effects were attenuated by TAT-εV1-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the blockade of cannabinoid receptor type 1, but not cannabinoid receptor type 2 receptor, reversed the increase in εPKC activation and neuroprotection induced by EA pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EA pretreatment may activate endogenous εPKC-mediated anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to protect against ischemic damage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> via cannabinoid receptor type 1, which represents a new mechanism of EA pretreatment-induced rapid tolerance to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
