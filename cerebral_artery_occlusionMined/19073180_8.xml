<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that MMP-9 siRNA can be effective as an MMP-9 protein inhibitor in a rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (156) were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (by using the suture insertion method) followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, 5 microl MMP-9 siRNA was administrated by intracerebroventricular injection within 60 min after 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The siRNA transfection was demonstrated by fluorescence conjugated siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MMP-9 siRNA produced a significant reduction in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume, brain water content, mortality rate and accompanying neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The followings were recorded: Evan's blue and IgG extravasation were reduced; the expression of MMP-9 mRNA and protein were significantly silenced; and immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of MMP-9 and VEGF were reduced while occludin and collagen-IV were up-regulated in brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide evidence that a liposomal formulation of siRNA might be used in vivo to silence the MMP-9 gene and could potentially serve as an important therapeutic alternative in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
