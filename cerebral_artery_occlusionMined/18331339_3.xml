<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) produced similar corticostriatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in MOP-knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of BrdU/doublecortin-colabelled cells in the granule cell layer 14 days after MCAO showed that ischemic knockouts contained more immature neurons generated during days 9-11 than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 29 days, similar quantities of BrdU/NeuN-labelled cells were found in ischemic knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice, suggesting that granule cells that were formed in excess during days 9-11 in the knockouts were eliminated by day 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis was similar in knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice subjected to sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to a transient increase in neurogenesis, MCAO caused a transient up-regulation of preprodynorphin and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the granule cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that activated signalling via endogenous opioids and the MOP limits the enhanced generation of neuronal cells after ischemic corticostriatal lesions </plain></SENT>
