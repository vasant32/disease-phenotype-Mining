<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Orthovanadate is a competitive inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of its reported biologic effects are its insulin mimetic property and its activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported its neuroprotective effect on delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of gerbil hippocampal CA1 neurons via Akt and ERK activation after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of postischemic intraperitoneal administration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> orthovanadate (2 l/kg of 50-mmol/l <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> orthovanadate in saline) was investigated in rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated 1 day and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of orthovanadate was significant in the cortex but not the caudate putamen (ischemic core) at both 1 and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In orthovanadate group, the activities of Akt and ERK were maintained after reperfusion; they were decreased in saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level decreased but within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was lower than that of saline group only at 0 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that orthovanadate has neuroprotective effects in rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and that these effects are mediated by Akt and ERK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and gradual recovery of regional cerebral blood flow may contribute to neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
