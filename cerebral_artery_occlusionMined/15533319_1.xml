<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> (0.5-10 mg kg(-1)) in a permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> model in mice, and compared its effect to that of MK-801 (0.3-3 mg kg(-1)) following administration 30 min prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A battery of histological and behavioural tests was employed following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to assess any neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> (1-5 mg kg(-1)) and MK-801 (1 or 3 mg kg(-1)) caused a comparable and significant reduction in the percentage hemisphere lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both drugs significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and neurological deficit score to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Locomotor activity in MCAO mice was not significantly improved by MK-801 or N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi>, although N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> induced a trend towards significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in rotarod performance was observed at neuroprotective doses with both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon comparison of the profile of effects, N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> at least matched the effectiveness of MK-801 as a neuroprotective agent in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in sham-operated control mice, N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> was well tolerated, in contrast to the pronounced adverse effects of MK-801 on locomotor activity and rotarod performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has shown that N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> is as effective a neuroprotective drug as MK-801 in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in contrast to MK-801, N(1)-dansyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> could be a promising therapeutic candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as it is well tolerated at neuroprotective doses in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
