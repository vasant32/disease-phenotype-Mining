<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rats were pretreated with resvreratrol at the dose of 10, 20, 40 mg kg(-1) for 7 days and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the neurological deficit were determined by the method of TTC (2, 3, 5-triphenylterazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>) staining and Longa's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The permeability of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) was evaluated by measurement of the evans blue (EB) content in the brain with spectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of interleukin-lbeta, interleukin-6 (IL-6, IL-1beta) in serum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), myeloperoxidase (MPO) in brain were determined by radio-immunoassay and ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, ameliorated the neurological deficit and the permeability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, the content of IL-6, IL-1beta in serum and TNF-alpha, MPO activity in brain tissue also were significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> had protective effects on cerebral injury by inhibiting the releasing of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
