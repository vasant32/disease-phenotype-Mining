<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we described cellular changes following Permanent Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes following PMCAO included a time-related focal pan <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, inflammatory cell infiltration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, and eventual loss of necrotic tissue post PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now characterized changes which occur after Temporary Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (TMCAO; 80 or 160 min) followed by reperfusion and compared these changes to those which occur following PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TMCAO with reperfusion results in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> which vary in size in an occlusion-time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 h of reperfusion, ischemic changes were observed histologically, including microhemorrhages and the beginning of a slight inflammatory infiltration in and around the meningeal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This infiltrate consisted primarily of neutrophils, which by 6 h of reperfusion was significant with infiltration from deep blood vessels into brain tissue, including the presence of some monocytes adhering within blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration occurred sooner and to a greater extent in reperfused tissues than in permanently occluded tissues, where it only began at 12 h post PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As occurred following PMCAO, increased Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity indicating <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> was first observed at 12 h postTMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 1-3 days of reperfusion, a heavy macrophage infiltrate was observed in the reperfused tissues in addition to a continued influx of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following 5 days of reperfusion, the lesion was completely replaced with inflammatory cells, of which macrophages predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike PMCAO, which resulted in focal spots of neutrophil accumulation, neutrophils were more distributed throughout the infarcted cortex following TMCAO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
