<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi>-anesthetized rat, the proximal portion of right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) was occluded, and H2 needle electrode was implanted in right striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF was monitored in striatum using hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten min after RMCA occlusion (RMCAO), NBP (5, 10, 20 mg.kg-1 i.p.) markedly increased rCBF to striatum (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When NBP was given i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>40 min after RMCAO, the increasing effect on rCBF was also observed (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when NBP was injected i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>60 min after RMCAO, the increasing effect of NBP on rCBF was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In NBP-pretreated (i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>40 min before RMCAO) group, rCBF in striatum measured at different time points of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after RMCAO were increased by 97%, 107%, 136%, 211%, 173%, and 317%, respectively, compared with the percentages of vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potency of the effect of Nim (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.p.) was similar to that of NBP (10 mg.kg-1 i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBP pre-treatment or post-treatment markedly enhanced the rCBF to striatum in RMCAO rats </plain></SENT>
