<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blocking oxidant radicals, reducing matrix metalloproteinase-induced neuronal damage, and use of stem cell therapy have been proposed and tested individually in prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we provide a comprehensive integrative management approach to reducing damage and promoting recovery by combining biological therapies targeting these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) gene delivery vectors were used to overexpress tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (TIMP1 and TIMP2) 3 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After occlusion, autologous bone marrow cells alone or in combination with agents to improve NO bioavailability were administered intraarterially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, BrdU incorporation, and motor function recovery were determined in the treatment groups the largest beneficial effect was seen in rats receiving the triple combined therapy, surpassing effects of single or double therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights the utility of combined drug, gene, and cell therapy in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
