<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, CI model, Acupunct (acupuncture), DCSI, Acupunct + DCSI groups, with 18 cases in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI model was duplicated by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DCSI (80 mg/kg) was given via the rat's tail vein, once daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Shuigou" (GV 26), "Neiguan" (PC 6), "Hegu" (LI 4), "Taichong" (LR 3) and "Zusanli" (ST 36), once daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit score (NDS), cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (CIV), water and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> (LA) contents in cerebral tissues were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control group, NDS, CIV, cerebral water content and LA in model group increased significantly (P&lt;0.05); while compared with model group, NDS, CIV, cerebral water content and LA in Acupunct, DCSI and Acupunct + DCSI groups decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison among DCSI group, Acupunct group and DCSI + Acupunct group showed that NDS, CIV, cerebral water and LA contents of Acupunct + DCSI group were significantly lower than those of the former two groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between DCSI and Acupunct groups in the above-mentioned 4 indexes (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined application of DCSI and acupuncture has a definite effect in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and is superior to that of simple acupuncture or DCSI alone </plain></SENT>
