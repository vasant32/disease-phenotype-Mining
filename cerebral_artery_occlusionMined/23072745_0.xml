<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated PHLPP1 knockout (KO) mice and used them to explore the ability of enhanced in vivo Akt signaling to protect the brain against ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brains from KO mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 hours showed significantly greater increases in Akt activity and less neurovascular damage after reperfusion than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the PHLPP1 KO was significantly reduced compared with WT (12.7±2.7% versus 22.9±3.1%) and this was prevented by Akt inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes from KO mice and neurons in which PHLPP1 was downregulated showed enhanced Akt activation and diminished cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in response to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, deletion of PHLPP1 can enhance Akt activation in neurons and astrocytes, and can significantly increase cell survival and diminish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PHLPP could be a therapeutic approach to minimize damage after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 17 October 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.150 </plain></SENT>
