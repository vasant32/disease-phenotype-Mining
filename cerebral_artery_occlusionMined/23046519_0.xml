<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including thrombolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator offer great promise for the treatment, but complimentary neuroprotective treatments are likely to provide a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To counteract the ischemic brain injury in mice, a new therapeutic approach has been employed by using palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PEA is one of the members of N-acyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi> family maintain not only redox balance but also inhibit the mechanisms of secondary injury on ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo)-induced animals with PEA reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and brain infractions as evidenced by decreased 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining across brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PEA-mediated improvements in tissues histology shown by reduction of lesion size and improvement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> level (assayed by Bax and Bcl-2) further support the efficacy of PEA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that PEA treatment blocked infiltration of astrocytes and restored MCAo-mediated reduced expression of PAR, nitrotyrosine, iNOS, chymase, tryptase, growth factors (BDNF and GDNF) and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PEA also inhibited the MCAo-mediated increased expression of pJNK, NF-κB, and degradation of IκB-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PEA-treated injured animals improved neurobehavioral functions as evaluated by motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings we propose that PEA would be useful in lowering the risk of damage or improving function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury-related disorders </plain></SENT>
