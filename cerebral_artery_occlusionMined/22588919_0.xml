<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomized equally into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and sham-operated groups, and right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in the former group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells and Foxp3 expression, respectively, in the peripheral blood and brain tissue at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> of the rats were evaluated using an improved NSS neurological functional scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological function scores of the two groups both gradually declined after the operation, and showed significant differences between the two groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the time points of measurement (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD4(+)CD25 T cells in the peripheral blood were similar between the two group at 1 and 3 days after the operation (P&gt;0.05), but increased significantly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group at 7 and 14 days (P&lt;0.05) with an inverse correlation to the neurological scores (r=-0.68, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry detected the presence of Foxp3 primarily in the ischemic region of the brain tissue 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; the contralateral hemisphere also showed a small quantity of Foxp3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No Foxp3 expression was detected in the brain tissue of the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CD4(+)CD25 T regulatory cells participate in the inflammatory immune reactions as early as 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, which might be a protective mechanism of the brain cells </plain></SENT>
