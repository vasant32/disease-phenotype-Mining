<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation state of 31 protein kinases/signaling proteins and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-)) production in the contralateral and ipsilateral cortex was measured after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in ovariectomized rats treated with placebo or TMX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study revealed that pMCAO modulated the phosphorylation of a number of kinases/proteins in the penumbra at 2 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of significant interest, phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) was elevated significantly after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TMX attenuated the elevation of pERK1/2, an effect correlated with reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ detection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) production showed a significant elevation at 1-2 h after pMCAO in the ischemic cortex with enhanced oxidative damage detected at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ERK activation may be downstream of free radicals, a suggestion supported by the findings that cells positive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) had high pERK activation and that a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) mimetic, tempol, significantly attenuated pERK activation after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TMX treatment significantly reduced the MCAO-induced elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) production, oxidative damage, and proapoptotic caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, pMCAO induced a significant reduction in the levels of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD (MnSOD), which scavenge <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-), an effect largely prevented by TMX treatment, thus providing a potential mechanistic basis for the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effects of TMX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a whole, these studies suggest that TMX neuroprotection may be achieved via an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> mechanism that involves enhancement of primarily MnSOD levels, with a corresponding reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) production, and downstream kinase and caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
