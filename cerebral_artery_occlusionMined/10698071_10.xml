<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the plasminogen activation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with and without reperfusion (reperfusion intervals 9 and 24 hours) in rats by histologic zymography and compared areas of increased plasminogen activation to areas of structural injury, which were detected immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, increased plasminogen activation was observed in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affected area measured 5.2%+/-8.5% and 19.4%+/-30.1% of the total basal ganglia and cortex area, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion for 9 hours after 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> led to a significant expansion of plasminogen activation in the basal ganglia (68.8%+/-42.2%, P &lt; 0.05) but not in the cortex (43.0%+/-34.6%, P = 0.394) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the basal ganglia, areas of increased plasminogen activation were related to areas of structural injury (r = 0.873, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No such correlation was found in the cortex (r = 0.299, P = 0.228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, increased plasminogen activation was demonstrated early in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This activation may promote early secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and also secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
