<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On intracerebroventricular injection of vehicle or TAK-779, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the vehicle-treated group was 44.2 +/- 13.2% of the contralateral hemispheric volume, and TAK-779 (25 and 250 ng/mouse) dose-dependently reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 35.0 +/- 12.2% and 31.1 +/- 12.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On intravenous injection, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the vehicle-treated group was 32.0 +/- 16.1%, and TAK-779 (5 microg per 20 g body weight) significantly reduced this to 22.0 +/- 10.5% </plain></SENT>
