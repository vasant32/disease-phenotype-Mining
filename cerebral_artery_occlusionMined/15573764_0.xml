<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion model was established by blocking the rat's middle cerebral artery with a pre-set nylon thread and removing it from the internal carotid artery 2 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>20 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were randomly divided into two groups: Group A, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, for control; Group B, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> treated with DCXW via gavage, 4.13 g/kg x d, twice a day for 3 days, while group A being given the same volume of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours after reperfusion, the neurological function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats was evaluated according to Longa, and the rats were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the samples of cerebrum were processed and embedded in paraffin and cut into sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> &amp; Eosin to measure the infarction volume and evaluate the effects of DCXW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The grade of neurological function of the treatment group (1.5+/-0.71) was lower than that of the control group (2.3+/-0.82), there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.032); the infarction volume of the treatment group was smaller than that of the control group, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that DCXW has a protective effect on the cerebrum undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
