<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the potential role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the brain's response to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in the permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated ERK p44 and p42 were increased time-dependently and significantly 18- and 28-fold, respectively, at 24-h post-pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, IL-1beta protein levels were significantly increased with the peak at 24 h in the lesioned core of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies using various stimuli have shown ERK-dependent IL-1 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from our study suggest that this relation may also exist in vivo in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the progressive nature of IL-1 induction, we hypothetized that inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE) could provide an extended time-window for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we applied N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD x fmk), an ICE blocker 3 or 6 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reductions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, however, were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together with previous results, where we showed protective activity of zVAD x fmk when given immediately after pMCAO, we conclude that the time window for zVAD x fmk is less than 3 h </plain></SENT>
