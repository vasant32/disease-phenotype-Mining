<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to measure the electrophysiological response of an array of individual neurons to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A custom-made microwire electrode array (16 channels) was implanted in the cortical area supplied by the middle cerebral artery, spanning the core and boundary of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological activity of individual neurons was simultaneously recorded before, during and one week after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuronal activities were significantly reduced immediately after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermittent silent periods (SP) appeared within minutes or hours after MCAo and lasted variable times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between intermittent SP, neurons fired irregular bursting spikes (BS) with small magnitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intermittent SP and irregular BS progressed in one day post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to persistent SP in channels close to the ischemic core or to regular BS with small amplitudes in the penumbral zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both persistent SP and regular BS persisted for at least seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrode array can be used to simultaneously record multiple individual neurons in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence that the primary electrophysiological activity of multiple individual neurons to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is reduced in the lesion boundary and/or stopped in and adjacent to the lesion core </plain></SENT>
