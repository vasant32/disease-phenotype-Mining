<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are few studies that denote whether bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) show the same therapeutic effects, when directly transplanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study therefore aimed to compare their biological properties and behaviors in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mouse BMSC were harvested and cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mouse MNC were obtained through centrifugation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their cell markers were analyzed with FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MNC (10(6) cells; n = 10) or BMSC (2 x 10(5) cells; n = 10) were stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their survival, migration, and differentiation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain were precisely analyzed using immunohistochemistry 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MNC were positive for CD34, CD45, CD90, but were negative for Sca-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BMSC were positive for CD90 and Sca-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transplanted BMSC, but not MNC, extensively migrated into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 20% of the transplanted BMSC expressed a neuronal marker, NeuN in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain, although only 1.4% of the transplanted MNC expressed NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that there are large, biological differences between MNC and BMSC as cell sources of regenerative medicine for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
