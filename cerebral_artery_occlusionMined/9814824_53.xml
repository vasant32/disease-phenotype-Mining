<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents the time course and a cellular localization of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, visualized by in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemical staining for microglia, macrophages, or astrocytes, on brain sections from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to transient proximal occlusion of their middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, an early and transient neuronal and microglial expression of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in the extraischemic cingulate and frontal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both early and protracted expression of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the caudate-putamen and neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and in the caudate-putamen penumbra colocalized with OX42/ED1-immunoreactive microglia and macrophages, whereas TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the neocortical penumbra colocalized with OX42/ED1-immunoreactive cells of a microglial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No astrocytes were double-labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing microglia and macrophages increased strongly during the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> became increasingly restricted to the neocortical penumbra (3 weeks), and after 3 months it was confined to activated microglia in the anterior commissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data establish activated microglia and macrophages as the major source of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> following experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, TGF-beta1-mediated functions may be exerted by microglia both in the early degenerative phase, and later in combination with blood-borne macrophages, in the remodeling and healing phase after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
