<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that the inhibition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) reduces ischemic brain injury; however, the molecular mechanism of the action of IL-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are investigating currently the role of NFkappaB during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, using mutant mice deficient in the interleukin-1 converting enzyme gene (ICE KO) in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male ICE KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (n = 120) underwent up to 24 hr of permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic phospho-NFkappaB/p65 expression in ischemic brain was examined using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NFkappaB DNA-binding activity was detected using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression was examined in both the ICE KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and immunostaining showed that the level of cytosolic phosphorylated NFkappaB/p65 increased after 2 and 4 hr of MCAO in WT mice; however, NFkappaB/p65 was significantly reduced after MCAO in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EMSA showed that NFkappaB DNA-binding activity increased after MCAO in WT mice; but this effect was reduced in the ICE KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of ICAM-1-positive vessels in the ischemic hemisphere was greatly attenuated in the ICE KO mice (P &lt; 0.05), which paralleled the results of immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that NFkappaB phosphorylation is reduced in ICE KO mice, suggesting that ICE or IL-1 are involved in early NFkappaB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced infarction is significantly reduced in ICE KO mice, we conclude that early NFkappaB phosphorylation plays a disruptive role in the ischemic process </plain></SENT>
