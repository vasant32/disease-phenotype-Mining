<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was developed by Koizumi in 1986 to simulate this impactful human pathology in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A modification of the MCAO method was later presented by Longa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both techniques have been widely used to identify molecular mechanisms of brain injury resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and potential therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This relatively noninvasive method in rats has been extended to use in mice to take advantage of transgenic and knockout strains </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retracting the suture after a specified period of time mimics spontaneous reperfusion, but the suture can also be permanently retained </plain></SENT>
