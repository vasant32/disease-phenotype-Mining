<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether autologous transplantation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) has a neuroprotective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into the sham, I/R injury model (I/R), and model plus autologous transplantation of ADMSCs (ADMSC) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral I/R injury was induced by 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in the I/R and ADMSC groups were intravenously injected with culture medium and ADMSCs (2.0x10(6)), respectively, at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion and 12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was detected by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histopathological changes and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic penumbra were evaluated with H&amp;E staining and the TUNEL assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) content, caspase-3 activity and the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression in the ischemic regions of rats was determined by immunohistochemical staining, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that autologous transplantation of ADMSCs significantly reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved the I/R injury-induced brain damages and inhibited the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ADMSC implantation also decreased caspase-3 activity and the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio, and markedly downregulated the expression of iNOS and thus prevented NO release in response to cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrated that autologous transplantation of ADMSCs can protect the brain against cerebral I/R injury via the inhibition of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
