<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture has been known to be effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is considered as a potential therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data have also shown that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> indeed brings benefit to cerebral circulation and behavior improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of electroacupuncture on vascular endothelial cell proliferation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced using the method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (with MCAO) and the electroacupuncture group (with MCAO+electroacupuncture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation were stained by double-immunofluorescence labeling method (Ki67 and vWF), region cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF), and the neurological scores was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture stimulation was applied to the acupoint GV26 (Shuigou) during the occlusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, the EC proliferation started at 24 hours, was sustained for at least 7 days with a maximum induction at 3 days, decreased thereafter at 7 days, and was absent at 12 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, EC proliferation started at 12 hours after MCAO in electroacupuncture group, and increased significantly in the number of cells at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days compared with control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture increased significantly the rCBF, and reduced markedly the neurological scores compared with control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This result suggests that the effect of electroacupuncture might be closely associated with promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the cerebral ischemic condition </plain></SENT>
