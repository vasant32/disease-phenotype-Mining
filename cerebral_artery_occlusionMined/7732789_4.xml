<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study was carried out on the striata of rats which had undergone transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there was a marked reduction in the number of calretinin-positive neurons in the ipsilateral ischemic lesion, although the striatal interneurons positive for parvalbumin, which are a neuronal population distinct from the calretinin-immunoreactive cells in the striatum, were spared in the insulted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that the striatal calretinin-positive neurons are less resistant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, suggesting that there may exist vulnerability differences among the striatal interneurons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
