<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have demonstrated strong expression of this transporter in cultured astrocytes, whereas in situ hybridization analysis has so far detected SVCT2 only in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the response of SVCT2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the brain to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced for 2 h by unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression patterns of SVCT2 and the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-activated immediate early gene Arc were investigated at 2 and 22 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SVCT2 and Arc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was lost in the ischemic core at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In areas outside the core, Arc was strongly up-regulated, primarily at 2 h, whereas SVCT2 showed an increase at 2 and 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SVCT2 expression was increased in neurons as well as in astrocytes, providing the first evidence for SVCT2 expression in astrocytes in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> as a neuroprotective agent and may have implications for therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the increase of SVCT2 in astrocytes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> suggests that cultured astrocytes are exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
