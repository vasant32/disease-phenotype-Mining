<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Determination of extent of infarction in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is most commonly achieved by either classical histology (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52295">thionin</z:chebi> staining) and light microscopy or staining with 2,3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques have limitations and we now describe a novel technique and its validation for assessment of the neuroprotective activity of AM-36, a novel arylalkypiperazine compound with combined <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocking activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AM-36 (1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle, was administered 30 min, 24 and 48 h after endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 72 h, brains removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to coronal sectioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a simple apparatus relying on basic principles of light propagation and a computerised image analysis system, ischemic damage in unstained slide-mounted sections was clearly visualised and measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AM-36 significantly reduced the area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in both cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method was verified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52295">thionin</z:chebi> staining, and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between methods at 72 h for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in the cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Highly significant correlations between methods were found at 3 and 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our method quickly and clearly delineates areas of damage in a manner superior to conventional staining methods </plain></SENT>
