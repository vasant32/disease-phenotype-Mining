<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We observed that the pro-opiomelanocortin-derived neuropeptide, gamma 2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi>), has various peripheral and central hemodynamic effects in the rat, including a marked enhancing effect on cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hemodynamic profile might be of interest in the pharmacotherapeutic approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Being an adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) analogue, gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> might also possess direct neuronal protective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in two rat models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> we studied the effects of gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi>, with nimodipine, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, as a reference compound, on parasagittal laser-Doppler-assessed cortical blood flow and infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized Wistar and F344 rats i.v. bolus infusions (four in total) of gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> or nimodipine or their vehicle controls were given 1 h before, 1 min after, and 1 h and 2 h after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used both an intravasal and an extravasal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> technique because pilot experiments had shown differences in the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with the two techniques. gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> (100 nmol/kg in 1 min) increased cortical blood flow significantly but transiently, both pre- and post-ischemically, whereas nimodipine (20 micrograms/kg in 1 min) increased cortical blood flow only pre-ischemically in both models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>. gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> had no effect on cortical and striatal infarction volume, while nimodipine caused a significant reduction of cortical infarction volume in the extravasal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To conclude, despite its hemodynamic and possible neuroprotective properties, gamma 2-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> did not prevent ischemic neuronal damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This might be partly due to the short half-life of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, leading to a transient increase in cortical blood flow and short neuronal exposure time, suggesting that prolonged infusion of the neuropeptide might be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results with nimodipine support the notion that it attenuates cortical ischemic damage, independently of effects on cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
