<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported differential alterations of the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work studied the evolution of opioid receptor types following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tMCAO), as well as the putative predictive potential of early neurochemical alterations on the delayed ischemic damage. delta receptors were significantly decreased as early as 6 h post tMCAO (-22% approximately -57% vs. sham group), followed by a decrease in the mu binding site density at 24 h post tMCAO (-18% approximately -65%), in infarcted and penumbral cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, early decreases in cortical opioid mu and delta receptor densities were found to significantly correlate (P &lt; 0.001, r(2) = 0.48 and 0.75, respectively) with the occurrence of delayed histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high correlation between decreases in mu and delta receptor densities at 6 h post tMCAO and the histological damage that occurred at 24 h post tMCAO suggests that these early neurochemical alterations could be used as predictive markers of delayed ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
