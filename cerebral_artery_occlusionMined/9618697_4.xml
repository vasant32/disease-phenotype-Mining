<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, a formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly reduced at one day by the treatment with GDNF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the induction of immunoreactive 70-kd heat shock protein (HSP70) was slightly ameliorated by the GDNF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the treatment with GDNF has a significant effect on ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation after continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and the effect is greatly associated with the reduction of apoptotic changes, but slightly with that of stress response of cells </plain></SENT>
