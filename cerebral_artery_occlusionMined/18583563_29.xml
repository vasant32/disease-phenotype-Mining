<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic postconditioning (Postcond) is defined as a series of intermittent interruptions of blood flow in the early phase of reperfusion that mechanically alters the hydrodynamics of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that Postcond reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the mechanisms of Postcond in cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of Postcond in focal cerebral I/R injury in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Postcond after 60 minutes of occlusion (beginning of reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed at 24 and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was evaluated by malondialdehyde assay, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related molecules were studied by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postcond treatment upregulated Bcl-2 and heat-shock protein 70 expression and downregulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release to the cytosol, Bax translocation to the mitochondria, and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postcond treatment also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels and improved neurologic scores compared with the I/R-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Postcond inhibits focal cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotective effect is likely achieved by antiapoptotic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
