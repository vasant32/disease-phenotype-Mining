<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to longitudinally examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of DKI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in an animal model of permanent and transient (45 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) during the hyperacute, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusional kurtosis showed different spatiotemporal dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, mean kurtosis (MK) was sensitive to hyperacute and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> changes, and exhibited different contrast than mean diffusivity (MD) and higher contrast than fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK contrast persisted 1 to 7 days post-occlusion, whereas MD showed renormalization at day 1-2 and reversed contrast at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current study showed that DKI has the potential to complement existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> imaging techniques, particularly in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> evolution </plain></SENT>
