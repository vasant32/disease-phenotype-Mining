<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 is secreted in latent form (pro-MMP-2), but the activation of pro-MMP-2 in the ischemic territory has not been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies of the expression of the direct activators of MMP-2, MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP, and the indirect activation system tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase (u-PA), its receptor (u-PAR), and its inhibitor PAI-1 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion were undertaken in basal ganglia samples from 26 adolescent male baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three MMPs, u-PA, u-PAR, and PA1-1, but not tissue plasminogen activator, were increased from 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts confirmed the increases in latent MMP-2, u-PA, u-PAR, and PAI-1 antigen very early after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns are consistent with secretion of pro-MMP-2 and its activators in the ischemic core, perhaps from separate cell compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rapid and coordinate appearance of pro-MMP-2 and its activation apparatus suggest that in the primate striatum this protease may participate in matrix injury during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
