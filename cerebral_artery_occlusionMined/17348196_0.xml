<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were subjected to MCAO by nylon thread, except the sham-group rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divied into four groups: sham-group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model-group, GETO-group(6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) )and Duxil-group (7.3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry technique we measured the expression quantity of CRF and PKC protein in hippocampus of MCAO rats at 2 h,6 h and 24 h after reperfusion, contrasted to Duxil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: CRF: There were lots of positive and deeper dyeing neurons in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of positive and lighter dyeing neurons in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO -group and Duxil-group respectively( P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PKC: There were a great number of denser positive granules in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of scattered positive granules in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group respectively( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the same time there was not significant difference about the expression of CRF and PKC protein between GETO group and Duxil-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high expression of CRF and PKC induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be one important factor that resulted in the delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GETO can down-regulate the expression of CRF and PKC induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which may be one of the mechanisms that the Chinese herbal extract complex, protect cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
