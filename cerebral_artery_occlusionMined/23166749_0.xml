<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Paeoniflorin (PF), the principal component of Paeoniae Radix prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to exhibit many pharmacological effects including protection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of PF on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are still under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that PF treatment for 14 days could significantly inhibit transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced over-activation of astrocytes and microglia, and prevented up-regulations of pro-inflamamtory mediators (TNFα, IL-1β, iNOS, COX(2) and 5-LOX) in plasma and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further study demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with PF suppressed the activations of JNK and p38 MAPK, but enhanced ERK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And PF could reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our in vitro study revealed that PF treatment protected against TNFα-induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present study demonstrates that PF produces a delayed protection in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-injured rats via inhibiting MAPKs/NF-κB mediated peripheral and cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals that PF might be a potential neuroprotective agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
