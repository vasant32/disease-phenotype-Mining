<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protective mechanisms involve enhanced cerebral vasodilation during ischemic stress as well as direct preservation of neuronal viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that if the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor subtype-alpha (ERalpha) is important to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>'s signaling in the ischemic brain, then ERalpha-deficient (knockout) (ERalphaKO) female mice would sustain exaggerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The histopathology of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-stained tissues was evaluated after reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 hours, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion) in ERalphaKO transgenic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice (C57BL/6J background strain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic cerebral blood flow mapping was obtained from additional female murine cohorts by using [(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total hemispheric tissue damage was not altered by ERalpha deficiency in female mice: 51.9+/-10.6 mm(3) in ERalphaKO versus 60.5+/-5.0 mm(3) in WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Striatal infarction was equivalent, 12.2+/-1.7 mm(3) in ERalphaKO and 13.4+/-1.0 mm(3) in WT mice, but cortical infarction was paradoxically smaller relative to that of the WT (20.7+/-4.5 mm(3) in ERalphaKO versus 30.6+/-4.1 mm(3) in WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraocclusion blood flow to the parietal cortex was higher in ERalphaKO than in WT mice, likely accounting for the reduced infarction in this anatomic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes by region or genotype in male animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of ERalpha does not enhance tissue damage in the female animal, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> inhibits brain injury by mechanisms that do not depend on activation of this receptor subtype </plain></SENT>
