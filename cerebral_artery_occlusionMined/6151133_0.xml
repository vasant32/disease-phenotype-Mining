<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, who had internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> that resulted in neurological deficit persisting for an average of more than 10 weeks, it was possible to perform a postoperative follow-up study for a period of six to eight years after extra-intracranial vascular anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial neurological examinations with grading of motor deficit and EEG analyses were performed to assess the clinical course of the cerebral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These long term examinations showed a postoperative continuing improvement of electrical brain activity in nearly two thirds of the patients, nine patients showed no significant changes and three worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EEG analytical findings correlated well to the neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of electrical brain activity was bilateral with accentuation over the affected hemisphere, a phenomenon known from follow-up nrCBF measurements after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up one patient died five years, one six years following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> under signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and one after six years suffering from a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> opposite to the side of anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the findings indicate that EEG analysis is of value for assessment of long term follow-up of cerebral ischaemic lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischaemic alterations of the brain can be improved by anastomosis, and especially in comparison to a non-operated group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the course of the operated one seemed to be more advantageous, as the five-year survival rate of the Framingham study for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims is 69% </plain></SENT>
