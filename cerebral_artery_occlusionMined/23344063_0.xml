<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous experiments showed that ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (ULMWH) reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and neurologic deficit in rats followed by transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but the mechanisms of its neuroprotective effect are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reported the effect of ULMWH on energy metabolism, inflammatory reaction and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ULMWH (0.5, 1 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered after the MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>24 h after the reperfusion, Spectrophotometric assay was used to determine the activity of ATPase and the content of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ICAM-1 and Caspase-3 genes were investigated by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the apoptotic percentage of cells in hippocampus was quantified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group, ULMWH significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> content and increased ATPase activity in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, ULMWH inhibited the neural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and decreased the expressions of ICAM-1 and Caspase-3 mRNA in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ULMWH exhibits a neuroprotective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury, partly through improving energy metabolism, inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and attenuating inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
