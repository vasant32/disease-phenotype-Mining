<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Clipping of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> often requires temporary vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, however, increases exponentially with occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that prolonged temporary occlusion might be tolerated if the occluded vessels were perfused with cold physiological saline solution (CPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A low-flow perfusion rate would permit surgical manipulation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> distal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the authors temporarily occluded the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) with an endovascular catheter in 6 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three animals, the treatment group, were perfused with 5-ml CPSS/hour through the occluding endovascular catheter into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and the other 3 served as an ischemic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the catheter was removed after 90 minutes of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain temperature was monitored with a stereotactically placed probe in the caudate-putamen in 2 separate experimental groups (11 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging perfusion scanning during vessel occlusion confirmed similar reduction of cerebral blood flow during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in both the simple-occlusion and perfusion-occlusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion scans performed 24 hours after temporary occlusion revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the ischemic control group of 138.3 +/- 28.0 mm(3) versus 9.9 +/- 9.9 mm(3) in the cold saline group (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A focal cooling effect during perfusion with CPSS was demonstrated (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged temporary cerebral vessel occlusion can be tolerated using superselective CPSS perfusion through an occluding endovascular catheter into the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique could possibly be applied in neurosurgery practice to the management of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
