<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin on neutrophil migration and expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin for 7 d and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by an MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 2-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and a 24-h reperfusion, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit were determined by the method of TTC staining and the Longa's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin on the migration of neutrophils was evaluated by measuring the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin significantly reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ameliorated the neurological deficit (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MPO activity and the expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in the vehicle-treated rats were increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin, the enzymatic activity of MPO and the expressions of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were significantly reduced compared with the vehicle-treated group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin can attenuate brain injury, down-regulate the protein expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selectin, and reduce the migration of neutrophils after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
