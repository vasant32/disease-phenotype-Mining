<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Systemic infection</z:e> has been shown to be a common preexisting condition in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine a possible consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e>, we used a novel electrochemical technique, which combines measurement of cerebral blood flow with measurement of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> concentrations, to examine the effect of pretreatment of pial vasculature with a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1 beta, on cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> concentration in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, neutrophil recruitment was measured using an immunohistochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that exposure of pial and cerebral vasculature to IL-1 beta significantly accelerates recruitment of neutrophils, reduces cerebral blood flow, and increases <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> concentration at the pial surface during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support the idea that prior exposure of brain vasculature to IL-1 beta results in acceleration of cerebrovascular injury by accelerating recruitment of neutrophils, which secrete <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding has possible implications for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with reperfusion agents in patients with preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
