<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treating rats that had permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a single dose of an anti-CD11b/18 monoclonal antibody injected 1 hour after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To mimic the clinical situation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> who may be treated within 1 hour of the ischemic event, the artery remained occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-one adult Wistar rats had permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and one was subjected to a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour later, 22 rats received CD11b/18 monoclonal antibody and an additional 20 were injected either with a nonspecific antibody (n = 10) or a buffer solution (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated at intervals ranging 12 to 96 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included neurological testing, daily evaluation of body weight, counts of white blood cells in the peripheral blood, measurement of the area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> in the ischemic hemisphere, counts of necrotic neurons, and counts of leukocytes sequestered in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In experiments terminated 12 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (n = 4), there were fewer necrotic neurons in the group treated with the CD11b/18 monoclonal antibody compared with the two controls (P &lt; .05), but this difference was not reflected in the neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numbers of necrotic neurons in experiments terminated &gt; 12 hours later were not different among the three subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>White blood cell counts in peripheral blood were lower in animals with <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> injected with the monoclonal antibody CD11b/18 (P &lt; .05); numbers of leukocytes sequestered in the ischemic hemisphere were not different in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither changes in body weight nor in the volume of the area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> were significantly different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
