<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The induction of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is considered to be an important marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury, and c-fos may upregulate the expression of other genes related to the secondary injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>dl-3-n-Butylphthaline(NBP) had been shown to have good anti-cerebral ischemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the in situ hybridization and Northern blot technique, the effect of NBP on the expression of hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and c-fos in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) rat caused by intraluminal thread was studied, and found that the expression of hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was at the lesioned site at 1 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It increased gradually with the duration of reperfusion time and peaked at 12 h at the lesioned site </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10 mg.kg-1 10 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or 20 mg.kg-1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), the expression of hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> attenuated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For c-fos, the expression appeared at 0.5 h of reperfusion, peaked at 3 h, and decreased at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NBP pretreatment (10 mg.kg-1 10 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) also decreased the c-fos expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same results were obtained with Northern blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since NBP had been shown to have good anti-cerebral ischemic effects, the attenuating effect on gene expression seemed to be the secondary effect after the alleviation of tissue injury </plain></SENT>
