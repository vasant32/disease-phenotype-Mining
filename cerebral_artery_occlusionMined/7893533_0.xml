<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that Cu-Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase transgenic mouse (tg-mouse) which is overexpressing Cu-Zn SOD, prevents post ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of free radicals and free radical scavengers on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), we established in vitro <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> model, using cultured brain endothelial cells (BECs) which were extracted from the tg-mice and non tg-mice (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To make the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> model, the BECs were cultured on the membrane which has 0.45 micron pores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After cells became confluent, the electrical resistance across the cell monolayer, which reflects the para-cellular flux of ionic molecules, was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> model of the tg-mouse were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28869">menadione</z:chebi> (Vitamin K3, intracellular <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> producting agent), and the segmental changes of the electrical resistance through the monolayer were compared with those of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to investigate the effect of the ironic ions which influence the metabolism of free radicals, desferroxamine mesylate (Fe chelating agent) was added to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> models before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28869">menadione</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cultured brain endothelial cells of tg-mouse has 1.7 times higher SOD activity than that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28869">menadione</z:chebi> treatment, it showed a significant decrease of electrical resistance in the tg-mouse earlier than that of the control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
