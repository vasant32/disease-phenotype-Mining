<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the mechanisms mediating Epo's neuroprotective activity in vivo, we made use of our transgenic mouse line tg21 that constitutively expresses human Epo in brain without inducing excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that human Epo is expressed in tg21 brains and that cortical and striatal neurons carry the Epo receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, human Epo potently protected brains of tg21 mice against ischemic injury, both when severe (90 min) and mild (30 min) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was imposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histochemical studies revealed that Epo induced an activation of JAK-2, ERK-1/-2, and Akt pathways in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activation was associated with elevated Bcl-XL and decreased NO synthase-1 and -2 levels in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injections of selective inhibitors of ERK-1/-2 (PD98059) or Akt (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>) pathways revealed that both ERK-1/-2 and Akt were required for Epo's neuroprotective function, antagonization of either pathway completely abolishing tissue protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, ERK-1/-2 and Akt blockade did not reverse the neuronal NO synthase-1/-2 inhibition, indicating that Epo down-regulates these NO synthases in an ERK-1/-2 and Akt independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data, the dual activation of ERK-1/-2 and Akt is crucial for Epo's neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
