<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As neurons rely almost exclusively on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as an energy substrate, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport is of critical importance to cerebral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two specific facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters, GT1 and -3, predominate in brain, with the latter exclusively expressed by neurons, whereas GT1 is expressed by astrocytes and vascular elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the regulation of these transporters at the genetic level or the extent to which their expression may change in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes in metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we employed in situ hybridization to evaluate changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter gene expression in the rat brain in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most remarkable responses were demonstrated by GT1, which within an hour of ischemic insult demonstrated a global increase in gene expression throughout the forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ensuing hours, GT1 expression further intensified and became lateralized to the lesioned hemisphere, with normalization of expression contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased GT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were found in astroglia and microvessels and were also present in distinct neuronal populations, including the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, and medial habenula, which normally do not express GT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 24 h post-MCAO, glial cells of the ipsilateral cortex surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone still demonstrated elevated GT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, but expression had returned to baseline in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it was not until GT1 expression had subsided (24 h post-MCAO), that there was a modest increase in neuronal GT3 gene expression in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GT2 and GT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were not detected in the rat brain under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induces an immediate and sustained increase in brain GT1 gene expression in both glial cells and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This augmentation of GT1 expression could represent a defensive strategy aimed at repletion of the brain's energy stores and stabilization of neuronal membrane potential </plain></SENT>
