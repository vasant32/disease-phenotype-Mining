<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although some clinical studies report a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence by <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, others have found increased mortality and morbidity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diathermy occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCAO), one of the most reproducible rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, has consequently been employed to investigate physiologic and supraphysiologic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-oestradiol</z:chebi> on ischaemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lister Hooded rats were ovariectomised (OVX) and a 21-day release pellet (placebo, 0.025 or 0.25 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-oestradiol</z:chebi>) implanted in the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks after OVX, animals underwent MCAO and were perfusion fixed 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal perikaryal damage was assessed from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained sections and in adjacent sections, axonal pathology was assessed with amyloid precursor protein and Neurofilament 200 (NF-200) immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-Oestradiol</z:chebi> induced a dose-dependent increase in neuronal perikaryal damage, 0.025 and 0.25 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-oestradiol</z:chebi> increased damage by 20% (P&lt;0.05) and 27.5% (P&lt;0.01) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-Oestradiol</z:chebi> did not influence axonal pathology compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-oestradiol</z:chebi> treatment can exacerbate brain damage in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, further investigation into the role of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> and the mechanisms which mediate its effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is required </plain></SENT>
