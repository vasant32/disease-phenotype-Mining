<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fruit juice of Morinda citrifolia (Noni juice) is a well-known health drink and has various pharmacological properties including <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hitherto found the protective effect of Noni juice on brain damage caused by ischemic stress in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also recently reported that regulation of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> might be important for good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on the effect of Noni juice on the development of the post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> as a cerebral protective mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noni juice was obtained from the mature fruit grown in Okinawa (about 1.5 L/4 kg of fruit; 100% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were given 10% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> in drinking water for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, mice were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ingestion of 10% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> suppressed the development of neuronal damage after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> observed on the 1st day after MCAO completely disappeared after 10% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> treatment significantly increased serum insulin levels much further than the control group on the 1st day, while serum adiponectin levels were not affected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> could facilitate insulin secretion after ischemic stress and may attenuate the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms may contribute to the neuronal protective effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e> against ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
