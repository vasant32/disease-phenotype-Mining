<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon (IFN)-beta, an immunomodulatory agent approved for treatment of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, is being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> rat IFN-beta and its pegylated counterpart (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN-beta) in a model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats (n=12/group) were treated with IV tail injections of 8 or 16 mug of IFN-beta in 300 muL of PBS once daily for 3 or 7 days or with IV or SC injections of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN-beta for 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were assessed daily for weight and for neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional animals underwent complete hematology and chemistry profiles, as well as complete multiorgan necropsy studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the brain tissue was evaluated for assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, neutrophil infiltration, and presence of hemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFN-beta and <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN-beta failed to protect against experimental ischemic brain injury as assessed by histopathology and neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IFN-beta treatment was associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and alterations in hematology and chemistry profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that additional preclinical studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
