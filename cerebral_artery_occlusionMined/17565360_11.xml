<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although neurons and glia inevitably undergo degeneration in the core of ischemic lesions, many cells, particularly immune cells, infiltrate the core and survive in it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such infiltrating cells may play certain roles in the regeneration and repair of damaged brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized macrophage-like cells that accumulated in the ischemic core of a rat brain whose right middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded for 90 mins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of the accumulated macrophage-like cells expressed Iba1, a marker of macrophages/microglia, as well as NG2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> (NG2), which has been recognized as a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such macrophage-like cells were termed BINCs (brain Iba1(+)/NG2(+) cells) to distinguish them from NG2(-)/Iba1(+) or NG2(+)/Iba1(-) cells that were also present in the perilesion and the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed the localization of NG2 along the plasma membrane of cells that had many phagosomes and irregular-shaped or reniform heterochromatin-rich nuclei, which are characteristics of monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain Iba1(+)/NG2(+) cells were highly proliferative and their number peaked at 7 days post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunoblot analysis of NG2 revealed the presence of two NG2s: one expressed by BINCs with a molecular weight of 300 kDa, and the other found in the contralateral hemisphere with a molecular weight of 290 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken the various functions of NG2, BINCs may be involved in not only phagocytosis of degenerated cells but also the healing and regeneration of lesion cores </plain></SENT>
