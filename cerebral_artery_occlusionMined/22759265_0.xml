<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> using pharmacological reagents has become a target of research for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, is induced during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and enhances inflammatory reactions through the release of enzymatic products, such as <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and COX-2 knockout (COX-2KO) mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, brain slices derived from these mice or brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were assessed and correlated with the state of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that components of the ECM, and specifically laminin, are transiently highly upregulated on endothelial cells after MCAO or OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This upregulation is not observed in COX-2KO mice or WT mice treated with COX-2 inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, suggesting that COX-2 is associated with changes in the levels of laminins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we report that transient ECM remodeling takes place early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and suggest that this increase in ECM protein expression may constitute an effort to revascularize and oxygenate the tissue </plain></SENT>
