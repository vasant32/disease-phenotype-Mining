<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Qualitatively and quantitatively different gross lesions marked by Evans blue-albumin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, large areas of strikingly altered cortical histology, postoperative survival and motor behavioral deficits differentiate young SHRSP from sham operated controls and the normotensive WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the limited focal lesion observed in normotensive and sham operated rats is primarily due to surgical trauma of exposing the vessel and passing the ligature deep to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The grossly larger and qualitatively different lesion in the SHRSP is the result of an inadequate circulation provided by the dorsal cerebral arterial collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the 5-6 week old SHRSP were only mildly hypertensive (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg), the inadequate collateral circulation appears to be related to either a genetic or acquired problem rather than being secondary to a vascular lesion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
