<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) monitoring was carried out in 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> cases where temporary clipping was employed electively under moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusion times ranged from 6.3 to 52 minutes at 28.7 degrees C to 32.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 15 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion cases the SEP was lost within 5 or 6 minutes in two cases undergoing early surgery and in one case with marked vasospasm and was lost within 9 minutes in one case with pre-existing infarction in the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SEP persisted throughout <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion periods of 6.3 to 52 minutes in 8 cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least 2 minutes of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion after loss of the SEP were tolerated without neurological sequelae, while transient new deficits were seen when <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was continued for 4 and for 4 + 11 minutes and an increased deficit was seen when occlusion was continued for 7 minutes after loss of the SEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each of the internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and bilateral anterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> groups the SEP was lost in one case and was absent for about one minute before reperfusion was instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ICA case had a transient deficit lasting about 4 hours; no other complications were seen in these two groups </plain></SENT>
