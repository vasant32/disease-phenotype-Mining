<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male SD rats received right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min and AST (40 mg/kg) was orally administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were decapitated 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and water content of brain were measured; the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), and the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (LD) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) of brain tissue were detected too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of inducible nitric synthase (iNOS), nerve growth factor (NGF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were measured by RT-PCR or real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AST could significantly reduce the neurological deficit score; infract volume and water content, increase SOD and LDH activities, decrease NOS activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, LD and NO content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AST treatment could down-regulate expression of iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, while, NGF and TrkA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that AST have the protective effects on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats at the different reperfusion time points, the mechanism may be related to the antioxidation, regulated the expressions of iNOS, NGF and TrkA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
