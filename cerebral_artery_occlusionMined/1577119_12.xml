<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study is focused on the survival of fetal neocortical grafts placed in the infarcted adult host cortex of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and describes the ability of host <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> into the graft after a focal ischaemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five to seven days following ligation of the right middle cerebral artery, dissociated neocortical primordium from fetuses of gestational age 12-18 days was implanted into the infarcted cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surviving transplants were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, although grafts derived from gestational age 12-14 days displayed an irregular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> rich in sinusoid-like cavities and containing fewer cells of apparently mature neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grafts from older donors contained perikarya of neuronal appearance; however, they lacked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortical lamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten days postgrafting, fibers stained by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-beta-hydroxylase, and 5-hydroxytryptamine immunohistochemistry were found in the grafts, and by 10-23 weeks after transplantation the fiber density had increased substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the retrograde tracer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">Fluoro-Gold</z:chebi> was injected into the grafted tissue, labeled cells were found in several subcortical nuclei of the host, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral pallidum, thalamus, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, as well as the ipsilateral and contralateral neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that grafts of dissociated neocortical tissue exhibit good survival and growth potential when implanted into infarcted neocortex and that several nerve fiber systems of the adult host have a regenerative capacity sufficient to innervate the grafted tissue </plain></SENT>
