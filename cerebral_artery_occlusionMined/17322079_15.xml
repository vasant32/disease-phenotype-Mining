<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation is a major factor limiting the use of tissue plasminogen activator for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased hemorrhagic transformation is also found in animals undergoing transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>; this study examined whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) could reduce such hemorrhagic transformation in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats received an injection of 50% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (6 mL/kg intraperitoneally) and had a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 10 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with HBO (3 ATA for 1 hour) 30 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control rats received normobaric room air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent reperfusion 2 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier permeability (Evans blue), hemorrhagic transformation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and mortality were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HBO treatment reduced Evans blue leakage in the ipsilateral hemisphere (28.4+/-3.5 versus 71.8+/-13.1 microg/g in control group, P&lt;0.01) 2 hours after reperfusion and hemorrhagic transformation (0.13+/-0.13 versus 0.31+/-0.28 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in the control group, P&lt;0.05) 22 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was less in the HBO group (4% versus 27% in controls, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and swelling in the caudate were also less in HBO-treated rats (P&lt;0.05), but HBO failed to reduce brain water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early intraischemic HBO treatment reduces the blood-brain barrier disruption, hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> suggesting that HBO could be used to reduce hemorrhagic conversion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
