<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral examination at 60 minutes after occlusion substantiated a high-grade deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two subgroups, LCBF was measured with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine at either 1.5 hours of MCAO, or at 1 hour of recirculation after suture removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two other matched subgroups, LCMRglc was measured with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> at 1.5 to 2.25 hours of MCAO, and at 0.75 to 1.5 hours of recirculation after 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average image data sets were generated for LCBF, LCMRglc, and the LCMRglc/LCBF ratio for each study time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours induced graded LCBF decrements affecting ipsilateral cortical and basal ganglionic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1 hour of recirculation, LCBF in previously ischemic neocortical regions increased by 40% to 200% above ischemic levels, but remained depressed, on average, at about 40% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, frank hyperemia was noted in the previously ischemic caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean cortical LCBF values during MCAO correlated highly with their respective LCBF values after 1 hour of recirculation (R = 0.93), suggesting that post-ischemic LCBF recovery is related to the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, LCMRglc during approximately 2 hours of MCAO was preserved, on average, at near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels; but following approximately 1 h of recirculation, LCMRglc became markedly depressed (on average, 55% of control in previously densely ischemic cortical regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis indicated that this depressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was determined largely by the intensity of antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By pixel analysis, the ischemic core (defined as LCBF 0% to 20% of control) comprised 33% of the ischemic hemisphere, and the penumbra (LCBF 20% to 40%) accounted for 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The penumbra was concentrated at the coronal poles of the ischemic lesion and formed a thin shell around the central ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During 2 hours of MCAO, the LCMRglc/LCBF ratio within the ischemic penumbra was increased four-fold above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (average, 179 umol/100 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In marked contrast, after approximately 1 h recirculation, this uncoupling had almost completely subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The companion study (Zhao et al., 1997) further analyzes these findings in relation to patterns of infarctive histopathology </plain></SENT>
