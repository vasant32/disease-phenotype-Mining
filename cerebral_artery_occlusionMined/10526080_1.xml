<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporalis muscle temperature as an indicator of brain temperature was monitored throughout the experiment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, which were randomly divided into seven groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, control rats received intravenous saline in a normothermic condition; treated rats had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and intravenous saline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, normothermia and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, normothermia and insulin, normothermia, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and insulin applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the experiment, the animals were killed, and brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were determined using a camera attached to the microscope, and analysed by image analysis software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total volume of infarcted tissue, right hemispheric volume, and the percentage of infarction were determined at the end of the image analysis investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on the control group was found to be 128.16+/-6.67 mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes in hypothermic groups were significantly smaller than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in the hypothermic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> have the greatest neuro-protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In normothermic rats, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume decreased proportionally but not statistically (p&gt;0.05) whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> or insulin was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results also demonstrate that pre-, and post-ischaemic serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations influence the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rats that had had pre-ischaemic high serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations had a higher volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than the hypothermic rats (p&lt;0.05), while rats with post-ischaemic low serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations had a lower volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than the control rats </plain></SENT>
