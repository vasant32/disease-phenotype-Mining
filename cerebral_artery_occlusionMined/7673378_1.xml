<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have made measurements of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> influx rate constant (K1) with [3H]<z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in three conditions: raised plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> concentrations induced by infusion with 50 mM <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (10 microliters/100 g/min); osmotic stress induced by i.p. injections of 1.5 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (2 ml/100 g) or distilled water (10 ml/100 g); and 4 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rats with MCAo, additional determinations were made of tissue water and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> contents, and blood-brain barrier passive permeability with [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> infusion increased plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> from 110 +/- 63 microM (SD) to 407 +/- 63 (p &lt; 0.001) and decreased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> K1 at the blood-brain barrier by 70% (p &lt; 0.001), signifying saturable uptake that maintained unidirectional influx constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, although hypo- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperosmolality</z:e> increased and decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> concentration, respectively, a reciprocal relationship between K1 and plasma <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in these experiments ensured that unidirectional fluxes of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> into brain were unchanged by osmotic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During MCAo, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> K1 was reduced 80% in the ipsilateral ischemic tissue compared with the contralateral nonischemic tissue (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decline may be due to a release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> into the brain circulation, because there was a concomitant loss of tissue <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> of 7.4 +/- 2.4 mmol/g dry weight (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternately, if <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> uptake is <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> dependent, the decline might reflect a disruption of the endothelial <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> gradient </plain></SENT>
