<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effect of low-dose (nonhypoglycemogenic) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> in 3 rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involving proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo): a thromboembolic model, a permanent suture occlusion model, and a temporary suture occlusion model with reperfusion (105 minutes occlusion, 2-day reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started at various times up to 6 hours post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were measured 48 hours post-MCAo using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> reduced total lesion volume by 53% in the thromboembolic MCAo model at 6 hours, reduced corrected cortical lesion volume by 51% in the permanent MCAo model at 4 hours, and reduced corrected cortical lesion volume by 41% in the temporary MCAo model at 5.75 hours (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of pooled data from the permanent MCAo and temporary MCAo series indicated a sigmoidal relationship between hemispheric swelling and corrected cortical lesion volume with the half-maximum cortical lesion volume being observed with 10% hemispheric swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> has a strong beneficial effect on lesion volume and has a highly favorable therapeutic window in several models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
