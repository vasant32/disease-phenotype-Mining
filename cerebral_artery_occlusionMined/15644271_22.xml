<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of brain was assessed in the brain slices stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hydrogen clearance techniques were used to monitor regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), spectrophotometric assay methods were used to determine the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-peroxidase (GSH-Px), contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the respiratory control ratio (RCR=State 3/State 4) was assessed in the brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that sublingual vein injection of 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 at doses of 10 and 5 mg kg(-1), but not 2.5 mg kg(-1) exhibited significant neuroprotective effects on rats against focal cerebral ischemic injury by markedly decreasing neurological deficit scores, reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and enhancing the rCBF compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time, 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism, antagonized decreases in SOD and GSH-Px activities and increase in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings suggest that 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 might provide neuroprotection against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced injury in rat brain through reducing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>, scavenging free radicals and improving the energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
