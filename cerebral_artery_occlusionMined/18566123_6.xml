<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is becoming increasingly clear that protein phosphatases are important modulators of cellular function and that disruption of these proteins are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) such as protein phosphatase PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin are involved in hyperphosphorylation of tau- as well as beta-amyloid-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown serine/threonine protein phosphatases to be involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin in the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> mediated neuroprotection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with protein phosphatases inhibitor II, endothall, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, which are specific inhibitors of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin, respectively, did not have an effect on cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in combination, these inhibitors adversely affected cell survival, which suggests the importance of serine/threonine protein phosphatases in maintenance of cellular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin attenuated the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced -neurotoxicity but did not completely abrogate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The attenuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection was achieved through decrease in the activity of theses serine/threonine phosphatases without the concomitant decrease in protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an animal model, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused a 50% decrease in levels of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B ipsilateral to the lesion in a manner that was prevented by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that in the face of cytotoxic challenges in vitro and in vivo, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> maintain the function of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin </plain></SENT>
