<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tight junction protein degradation is a principal characteristic of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage that occurs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We investigated the mechanisms of occludin degradation that underlie permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Western blot and Co-immunoprecipitation data indicated ubiquitination and degradation of occludin in brain after pMCAO, which was consistent with ZO-1 degradation in penumbra regions as observed at 24 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further investigated candidate protease(s) responsible for the degradation of occludin during pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intraventricular administration of γ-secretase blocker DAPT significantly inhibited the pMCAO-induced neurovascular damage, whereas ALLM and Batimastat, which are inhibitors of calpain and metalloproteinase proteases, respectively, were less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, we found that DAPT significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in comparison with vehicle treatment, as assessed by Evans blue excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the confocal immunostaining revealed that activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Itch</z:e> is associated with degradation of occludin in brain microvessels following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the inhibition of γ-secretase signaling and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itch</z:e>-mediated ubiquitination of occludin likely underlie the vasoprotective effect of DAPT after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The γ-secretase blocker DAPT reduces the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> by decreasing the ubiquitination and degradation of occludin during permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, suggesting that γ-secretase may represent a novel therapeutic target for preventing neurovascular damage </plain></SENT>
