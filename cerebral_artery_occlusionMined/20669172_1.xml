<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been shown to produce focal signal intensity changes in the ischemic boundary on MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes have been attributed to the influx of iron-laden blood-borne macrophages, although it has been suggested that this effect might not always be completely specific to inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate this phenomenon in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> time frame that is more relevant to the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging experiments (T(2) -, T(2)*- and T(1) -weighted sequences) were acquired in Wistar rats 6 days after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were intravenously infused with different doses of ultrasmall superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO) nanoparticles (300, 600 or 1000 µmol Fe/kg), or saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>, and imaged again 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue was immediately processed for immunohistochemistry with the macrophage marker ED-1, in combination with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> for iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic tissue exhibited a large increase in T(2) values, and overall contrast enhancement was apparent in the brain and surrounding muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast with previous reports, there were no regions of focal signal intensity changes in the ischemic territory in any of the images, although a region of interest analysis revealed a trend towards iron accumulation in the ischemic hemisphere, particularly in the cortex of T(2)* images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, histological examination revealed that, despite extensive ED-1-positive macrophage accumulation in the entire ischemic territory, none of these cells were <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> positive, except in the meninges of one animal that received a high dose of USPIO nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results imply that the observed trend is a result of the presence of contrast agent in the blood, or meninges, and not iron-containing inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
