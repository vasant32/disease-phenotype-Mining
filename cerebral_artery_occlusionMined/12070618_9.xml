<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant association exists between focal cerebral injury and an excessive release of extracellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo microdialysis was used in the present study to examine the effect of HBO on <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> release in the striatum during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histological changes occurring were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) using a surgically placed intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control rats (n=8) were subjected to 1 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whilst the study rats (n=8) were in addition treated with HBO (2.8 atmospheres of absolute pressure 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups were returned to breathing room air at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis samples were continuously collected at 15 min intervals at 2 microl.min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The [mean (SE)] increase in release of striatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> attained significance after 30 min of occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> [170 (24)%], and continued to increase [268 (26)% at 45 min] reaching a peak level at 60 min [672 (59)%] before returning to the baseline level during the late reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> in HBO treated rats during the period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and neuronal shrinkage were observed by histological examination in HBO treated rats when compared to the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HBO, when administered during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, offered significant neuroprotection in our experimental model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism seems to imply, at least in part, a reduced level of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
