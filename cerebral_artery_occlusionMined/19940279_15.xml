<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likely linked to the stage of differentiation of the cells at the time of implantation, formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can also be influenced by factors released by the host tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the relative effects of the stage of differentiation and the postischemic environment on the formation of adverse structures by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four differentiation stages were identified on the basis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of pluripotency, proliferation, and differentiation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neural progenitors were transplanted at these 4 stages into rats with no, small, or large middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fate of each transplant was compared with their pretransplantation status 1 to 4 months posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The influence of the postischemic environment was limited to graft survival and occurrence of nonneuroectodermal structures after transplantation of very immature neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both effects were lost with differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified a particular stage of differentiation characterized in vitro by a rebound of proliferative activity that produced highly proliferative grafts susceptible to threaten surrounding host tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the ischemic environment on the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors are limited to early differentiation stages that will likely not be used for stem cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hyperproliferation observed at later stages of differentiation corresponds to an intrinsic activity that should be monitored to avoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
