<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> has been shown to provide cortical as well as, under certain conditions, subcortical neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models so far (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal asphyxia</z:e>, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has led to the suggestion that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> could be a cost-efficient alternative to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>, a metabolically inert gas thought to be gold standard in gas pharmacology but whose clinical development suffers its little availability and excessive cost of production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> interacts with the thrombolytic agent tissue plasminogen activator, which is the only approved therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to date, still remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This latter point is not trivial since previous data have clearly demonstrated the inhibiting effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> on tPA enzymatic and thrombolytic efficiency and the critical importance of the time at which <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> is administered, during or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in order not to block thrombolysis and to obtain neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> on tPA enzymatic and thrombolytic efficiency using in vitro methods shown to provide reliable prediction of the in vivo effects of both oxygen and the noble <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33309">inert gases</z:chebi> on tPA-induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> has a concentration-dependent dual effect on tPA enzymatic and thrombolytic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low and high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> of 25 and 75Â vol% respectively block and increase tPA enzymatic and thrombolytic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible use of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> at low and high concentrations in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> if given during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or after tPA-induced reperfusion is discussed as regards to its neuroprotectant action and its inhibiting and facilitating effects on tPA-induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-tPA interactions are also discussed </plain></SENT>
