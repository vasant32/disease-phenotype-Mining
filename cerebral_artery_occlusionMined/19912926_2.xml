<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 1 h postlesion (PL), there was a striking increase in EGR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in neurons throughout the ipsilateral cortex, with a lesser increase occurring in a patchy distribution in the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral hemispheric reaction was maximal at 1 h PL, slightly reduced after 3 and 5 h, and resolved after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham surgery limited to meningeal disruption resulted in a similar though less intense induction of EGR1 gene expression in the ipsilateral cortex only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After MCAO but not sham surgery, there was a vivid induction of EGR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral hippocampal formation (CA3 &gt; CA1 &gt; DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the hemispheric cortical and hippocampal increases in EGR1 expression had normalized at 24 h PL, intense EGR1 gene expression was seen in neurons of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EGR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also increased in reactive glial cells in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone from 1 to 9 days after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, successive waves of transient EGR1 gene expression mark the brain's response to ischemic injury: these include the widespread, unilateral cortical induction associated with the phenomenon of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, an apparent trans-synaptic activation of contralateral cortex and ipsilateral hippocampal formation-and more sustained responses in injured but surviving neurons and reactive glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extensive EGR1 expression demonstrated in this experimental paradigm suggests that EGR1 is a fundamental component of neural cell activation </plain></SENT>
