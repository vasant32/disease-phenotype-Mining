<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten days after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the SEP was absent in the majority of rats tested and in the remainder the wave amplitude was reduced compared to the potential recorded from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemisphere but latency was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histochemical staining with Tetrazolium for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size has shown that loss of the SEP correlated with ischaemic damage to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEP recording can be used to assess the extent of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in this small animal model </plain></SENT>
