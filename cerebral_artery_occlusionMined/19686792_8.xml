<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We and others have shown that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces lateral migration of neuroblasts from the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) to the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathways underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the role of osteopontin (OPN) in post-ischemic lateral migration of neuroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult spontaneous hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of OPN in the ischemic brain was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, which showed that an up-regulation of OPN expression in the ipsilateral striatum at day 3, 7, 14 and 1 month of reperfusion with a peak at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed co-localization of OPN with ED1(+) macrophages/microglia in the ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of OPN activity by infusing a neutralizing antibody against OPN into the ischemic striatum significantly decreased the area covered with doublecortin(+) neuroblasts in the ipsilateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, OPN treatment did not affect the proliferation of neural progenitors, but induced an increased trans-well and radial migration of neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cultured neural progenitors expressed the OPN receptors CD44 and integrin beta(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blockade of the CD44 receptor had no effects on OPN mediated trans-well and radial migration of neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, blockade of integrin beta(1) receptor abolished the migration of neural progenitors in the absence or the presence of OPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that up-regulated expression of OPN produced by macrophages/microglia in the ischemic brain is an attractant and inducer for the lateral migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ to the injured region </plain></SENT>
