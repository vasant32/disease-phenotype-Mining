<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavenging enzyme, Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD-1), ameliorates various types of brain injury resulting from temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006080'>CNS ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have compared the cerebroprotective properties of human SOD-1 (hSOD-1) with a novel recombinant SOD-1 hybrid protein, SOD:Tet451, composed of hSOD-1 linked to the neuronal binding fragment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxin (TTxC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following 2 h of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats infused with equivalent activities of either hSOD-1 or SOD:Tet451 for the initial 3 h of reperfusion showed reductions in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 43 and 57%, respectively, compared to saline-treated controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum hSOD-1 concentrations in rats receiving SOD:Tet451 were seven-fold higher than those in rats receiving the native enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with SOD:Tet451 also demonstrated an extended persistence of hSOD-1 in the bloodstream during drug washout as compared to animals given free enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination of brain sections from an SOD:Tet451-treated ischemic rat showed positive immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex using either anti-TTxC or anti-human SOD-1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results document that both hSOD-1 and SOD:Tet451 significantly reduce brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our findings suggest that the cerebroprotective effects of SOD-1 may be enhanced by neuronal targeting as seen with the hybrid protein SOD:Tet451 </plain></SENT>
