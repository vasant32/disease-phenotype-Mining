<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human umbilical cord multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) have recently been identified as ideal candidate stem cells for cell-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate therapeutic potentials of intracerebral administration of UC-MSC in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 2-hr middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and received 2 10 UC-MSC or phosphate-buffered saline as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function evaluation was conducted weekly after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain injury volume and in vivo differentiation of transplanted UC-MSC were detected 2 or 5 weeks after the UC-MSC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, vascular density, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor expression in ipsilateral hemisphere after treatment and in vitro angiogenic potential of UC-MSC were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transplanted UC-MSC survived for at least 5 weeks in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the phosphate-buffered saline control, the UC-MSC treatment significantly reduced injury volume and neurologic functional deficits of rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ischemic brain, UC-MSC widely incorporated into cerebral vasculature and a subset of them was capable of differentiating into endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the UC-MSC treatment substantially increased vascular density and vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor expression in ipsilateral hemisphere of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro induction and tube formation assay further confirmed their angiogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UC-MSC transplantation could accelerate neurologic functional recovery of rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which may be mediated by their ability to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
