<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fodrin breakdown was measured by western blot followed by a densitometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In slices of the rat cerebral cortex, a pronounced fodrin breakdown was observed under hypoxic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of fodrin breakdown was completely blocked by omission of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and significantly inhibited by calpain inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi> and calpain inhibitor-I, thereby suggesting that the fodrin breakdown induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is due to the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-stimulated neutral protease calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NS-7 (1-30 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-induced fodrin breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats with unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a pronounced fodrin breakdown was observed in the cerebral cortex and striatum, although the time course for the development of the fodrin breakdown was much slower in the cerebral cortex than in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NS-7 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), when injected immediately after MCAO, suppressed not only the fodrin breakdown but also the infarction in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results it is suggested that inhibition of calpain activation is implicated in the neuroprotective action of NS-7 </plain></SENT>
