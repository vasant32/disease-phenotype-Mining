<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated how various steps of neurogenesis are affected by intrastriatal transplantation of human NSCs at different time points after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and with different numbers of cells in each implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and then received intrastriatal transplants of NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation shortly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (48 hours) resulted in better cell survival than did transplantation 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the delayed transplantation did not influence the magnitude of migration, neuronal differentiation, and cell proliferation in the grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplanting greater numbers of grafted NSCs did not result in a greater number of surviving cells or increased neuronal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of activated microglia was observed at 48 hours after the insult in the injured striatum, but reached maximum levels 1 to 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that the best survival of grafted human NSCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-damaged brain requires optimum numbers of cells to be transplanted in the early poststroke phase, before the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings, therefore, have direct clinical implications </plain></SENT>
