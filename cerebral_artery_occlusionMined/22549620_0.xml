<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects of MSCs are often attributed to their immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the influence of MSCs on the immune system after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is poorly understood, but requires special consideration because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced immunodepression that predisposes to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we intravenously transplanted syngeneic murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (mMSCs) into C57BL/6 mice at 6 hours after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo; 60 minutes) to investigate the impact of MSCs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced immunodepression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of syngeneic splenocytes or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An immune status was determined by flow cytometry on days 3 and 14 after MCAo, which did not reveal any negative effects of cell transplantation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced immunodepression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although our mMSCs were found to exert immunosuppressive effects in vitro, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001819'>immune cell dysfunction</z:mp> was not altered by mMSCs in ex-vivo stimulation assays with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, systemic inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factorα, interferonγ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) remained unchanged in the sera of mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results reduce safety concerns about MSC administration in ongoing clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
