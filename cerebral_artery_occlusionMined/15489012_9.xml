<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have reported that ICAM-1 is localized in astrocytes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the regulation of astroglial ICAM-1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is not elucidated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the gene and protein expression of TNFR1 after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) by using real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we determined the relationship of TNFR1 and ICAM-1 in the astrocyte in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of TNFR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral cortex was noted slightly during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and was significantly increased at 12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few TNFR1-like imuunoreactivity (TNFR1-LI) was observed in the cortex of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, TNFR1-LI was increased at 1 h during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, then it was decreased at 3-6 h, and was increased again at 12-24 h after reperfusion in the core of ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNFR1-LI was demonstrated in both neurons and astrocytes but not in oligodendrocytes and microglia/macrophages at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 96 h after tMCAO, TNFR1-LI was increased in the perifocal region and it appeared to be displayed the astrocyte-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By use of double immunostaining method, we found that the ICAM-1-LI was overlapped with GFAP-LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicates that the expression of TNFR1 is up-regulated in accordance with ischemic insult and delayed expressed TNFR1-LI co-localized with ICAM-1-LI in astrocytes after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that astroglial ICAM-1 is regulated by TNF-alpha dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
