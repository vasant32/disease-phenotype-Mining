<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1998) Neuroscience 85, 15-27] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis in an identical paradigm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>. whether alterations in the densities of both excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors may underlie these pathophysiological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations in densities of [3H]dizocilpine, [3H]D,L-amino-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, [3H]kainate and [3H]muscimol binding sites were demonstrated with quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> binding sites were severely reduced in the core of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A completely different reaction was found in the exofocal, histologically inconspicuous parts of the somatosensory cortex and the more remote neocortical areas of both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The [3H]muscimol binding sites were significantly reduced four weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the motor cortex, hindlimb representation area and exofocal parts of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The focus of the reduction in [3H]muscimol binding sites was found in lower layer V and upper layer VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrastingly, the densities of [3H]dizocilpine binding sites were found to be increased in these areas, whereas those of [3H]D,L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and [3H]kainate binding sites did not show significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The [3H]dizocilpine binding site density increased predominantly in layers III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> binding sites were also reduced in the retrogradely reacting, gliotic part of the ipsilateral ventroposterior thalamic nucleus, whereas the [3H]D,L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid binding sites were increased in the surround of the ipsilateral nucleus and no changes in binding sites were seen in the whole contralateral nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that permanent local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> leads to a long-term and widespread impairment of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> balance between binding sites of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in neocortical areas far away from the focus of the post-ischemic tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The imbalance comprises an up-regulation of the [3H]dizocilpine binding sites in the ion channels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptors and a down-regulation of [3H]muscimol binding sites of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors in the ipsi- and contralateral neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These changes at the receptor level explain the previously observed hyperexcitability with the appearance of epileptiform field potentials and the long duration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials four weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
