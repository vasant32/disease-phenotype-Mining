<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The effect of pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> / <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchange inhibitor was studied in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male wistar rats were subjected to 2 hr of MCAO followed by 22-hr reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grip strength, locomotor activity, and spontaneous alternation performance were assessed after 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after behavioral activities, animals were sacrificed and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers were estimated in brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS), reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes activities, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) were observed following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (0.91 and 1.82 mg/kg p.o) significantly reversed the MCAO-induced elevation in TBARS but could not reverse the other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> further reduced the levels of GPx, GR, and SOD, but no significant changes were observed in the catalase activity, grip strength, and spontaneous alternation behavior of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Locomotor activity was reduced slightly but reversed on pretreatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although pretreatment with single dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> showed reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, further multiple doses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as pre- and post-treatments are required to establish its potential to be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
