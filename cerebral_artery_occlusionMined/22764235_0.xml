<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CNTF increases rapidly and greatly following traumatic or ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Understanding the underlying mechanisms would help to design pharmacological treatments to increase endogenous CNTF levels for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that astroglial CNTF expression in the adult mouse striatum is increased twofold within 1 h and increases up to &gt;30-fold over 2 weeks following a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> caused by intrastriatal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> resulted in a comparable increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cocultured neurons reduced CNTF expression in astrocytes, which was prevented by light trypsinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) blocking <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> induced CNTF expression, which was dependent on transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Astroglial CNTF expression was not affected by diffusible neuronal molecules or by <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> does not seem to directly increase CNTF, as intrastriatal injection of an ischemic solution or exposure of naive mice or cultured cells to severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> had minimal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory mechanisms were probably also not involved, as intrastriatal injection of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL6) in naive mice had no or small effects, and anti-inflammatory treatments did not diminish the increase in CNTF after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CNTF-/- mice had more extensive tissue loss and similar astrocyte activation after MCAO than their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that contact-mediated integrin signaling between neurons and astrocytes normally represses CNTF expression and that neuronal dysfunction causes a rapid protective response by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
