<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A few studies have shown that rTMS might protect against delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, enhance long-term potentiation in ischemic conditions and affect regional brain blood flow and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) content and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) expression in rat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To study the effects of different timecourses of rTMS on ATP content and MAP-2 expression, 90 rats were randomly divided into three groups (30 rats in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study the effects of multiple rTMS parameters on ATP content and MAP-2 expression, the rats in each group were further divided into six subgroups (five rats each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed at 1-hour, 24-hour and 48-hour intervals after reperfusion, and the brain tissues were collected for the detection of ATP and MAP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rTMS could significantly increase ATP content and MAP-2 expression in the left brain following ischemic insult (P &lt; 0.01) and different rTMS parameters had different effects on the ATP level and the MAP-2 expression in the left striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high-frequency rTMS played an important role in MAP-2 expression and ATP preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that rTMS induced significant increase of ATP content and MAP-2 expression in the injured area of the brain, suggesting that the regulation of both ATP and MAP-2 may be involved in the biological mechanism of the effect of rTMS on neural recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rTMS may become a potential adjunctive therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
