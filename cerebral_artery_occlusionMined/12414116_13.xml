<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated form of PTEN (p-PTEN) is a key survival factor relating PI3K-Akt pathway and their downstream effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A spatiotemporal profiles of PTEN and p-PTEN expression were immunohistochemically examined after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, PTEN progressively decreased by 3 days, whereas a rapid but transient increase of p-PTEN was found with a peak at 1 h after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the ischemic penumbra, PTEN showed a minor change and a gradual but sustained p-PTEN expression was observed in the ischemic penumbra with a peak at 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the balance of population among strongly, moderately, and weakly stained cells was different between the ischemic core and penumbra at their peak time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an important role of p-PTEN for cell survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as an upstream regulator for PI3K-Akt </plain></SENT>
