<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction remains unclear but several studies suggest that it is preferentially triggered by mild/moderate microcirculatory disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined in cats whether induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after 2.5 h of unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus 10 h of reperfusion is influenced by the degree of cerebral microcirculatory disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative monitoring over time of the disturbances of cerebral microcirculation in ischemic brain areas and evaluation of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> associated with perfusion deficits was achieved by using two noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques: (a) high-speed echo planar imaging combined with a bolus of magnetic susceptibility contrast agent; and (b) diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-positive cells were counted in anatomic areas with different severity of ischemic injury characterized by magnetic resonance imaging, triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and hemotoxylin and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-positive cells was significantly higher in anatomic areas with severe perfusion deficits during occlusion and detectable histologic changes 10 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in areas where perfusion was reduced but maintained during occlusion there were no detectable histological changes and significantly fewer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar number of cells that undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were shown in regions with transient or prolonged subtotal perfusion deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the apoptotic process is induced in the ischemic core and contributes significantly in the degeneration of neurons associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
