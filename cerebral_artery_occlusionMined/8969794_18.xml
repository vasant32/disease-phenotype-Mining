<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tacrolimus (FK506) is a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> that is presently in clinical use for prevention of allograft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, animal studies reporting significant reductions in the volume of tissue damage associated with cardiac, hepatic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> suggest that tacrolimus may also be of use in the clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examine whether the neuroprotective effects of tacrolimus, as assessed by histological outcome, are accompanied by an amelioration of the skilled motor deficits induced in the rat by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Animals were trained to perform a skilled paw-reaching task before MCAO by perivascular microinjections of endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus (1 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) was administered by intravenous infusion 1 minute after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 5-day postoperative recovery period, the rats were retested for skilled paw-reaching ability for an additional 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vehicle-treated rats, MCAO resulted in a profound bilateral impairment in skilled paw use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with tacrolimus, although still impaired, performed significantly better than those treated with vehicle alone (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis, 14 days after occlusion, confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of tacrolimus with a 66% reduction in the volume of hemispheric brain damage produced by MCAO (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present studies show that tacrolimus not only protects neural tissue from focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> but also significantly ameliorates the deficits in skilled motor ability produced by this lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide further support for the view that tacrolimus may be of use in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
