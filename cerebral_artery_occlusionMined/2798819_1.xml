<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examinations were performed with Helmholtz coil and multiple echo sequences with TR 1,500 ms and TE 30-240 ms (8 echoes) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2 prolongation was noted already 3 hours after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the values increased during the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted images were much less sensitive for the detection of increased water content </plain></SENT>
