<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it has been shown that cells present within this region can be rescued and resuscitated by restoring perfusion and through other protective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the early detection of the ischemic penumbra can be exploited to improve outcomes after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcription factor induced by a reduction in molecular oxygen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the role of HIF-1 in the ischemic penumbra remains unknown, there is a strong correlation between areas with HIF-1 activity and the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recently developed a near-infrared fluorescently labeled-fusion protein, POH-N, with an oxygen-dependent degradation property identical to the alpha subunit of HIF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we conduct in vivo imaging of HIF-active regions using POH-N in ischemic brains after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced using the intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> technique in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that POH-N enables the in vivo monitoring and ex vivo detection of HIF-1-active regions after ischemic brain injury and suggest its potential in imaging and drug delivery to HIF-1-active areas in ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
