<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> EP2 receptor has been shown to be important in dictating outcomes in various neuroinflammatory disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the importance of the EP2 receptor in short- and long-term ischemic outcomes by subjecting <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> (WT) and EP2 knockout (EP2-/-) mice to two distinct and complementary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models [transient and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO and pMCAO)] and by using the EP2 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> ONO-AE1-259-01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, WT and EP2-/- mice were subjected to 90-min tMCAO with a monofilament followed by 4-day reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, WT mice were infused intracerebroventricularly with vehicle or ONO-AE1-259-01 45-50 min before being subjected to tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, WT and EP2-/- mice were subjected to pMCAO and allowed to survive for an extended period of 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes in EP2-/- mice were 55.0 +/- 9.1% larger after tMCAO and 33.3 +/- 8.6% larger after pMCAO than those in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral deficits also were significantly greater in the EP2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EP2 is beneficial and that activation is sustained for days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that pharmacologic activation of EP2 with 1.0- and 2.0-nmol doses of ONO-AE1-259-01 was sufficient to significantly reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in WT mice compared with that in vehicle-treated controls (20.1 +/- 3.9% vs. 37.1 +/- 4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reduction correlated with improved neurologic scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant effect on physiologic parameters was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Together, our results reveal that pharmacologic stimulation of the EP2 receptor has an important beneficial role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and might be considered as an adjunct therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
