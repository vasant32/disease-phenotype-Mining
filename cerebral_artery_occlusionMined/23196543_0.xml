<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be produced from basically any part of patients, with high reproduction ability and pluripotency to differentiate into various types of cells, suggesting that iPS cells can provide a hopeful therapy for cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, transplantation of iPS cells into ischemic brain has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that the iPS cells fate in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Undifferentiated iPS cells (5Ã—10(5)) were transplanted into ipsilateral striatum and cortex at 24 h after 30 mins of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral and histologic analyses were performed at 28 day after the cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, the transplanted iPS cells expanded and formed much larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in mice postischemic brain than in sham-operated brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical recovery of the MCAO+iPS group was delayed as compared with the MCAO+PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>iPS cells formed tridermal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>, but could supply a great number of Dcx-positive neuroblasts and a few mature neurons in the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>iPS cells have a promising potential to provide neural cells after ischemic brain injury, if <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> is properly controlled </plain></SENT>
