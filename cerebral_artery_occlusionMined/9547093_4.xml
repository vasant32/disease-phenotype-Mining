<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The response of microglia and astrocytes, as detected immunohistochemically by the monoclonal antibody OX-42 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) respectively, was studied in the rat lumbar spinal cord following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> produced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) above the rhinal fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 2 days after right-sided <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, OX-42 immunoreactivity of microglia in both the contralateral dorsal and ventral horns of the lumbar spinal cord was moderately increased compared with cells of the ipsilateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microglial reaction was progressive, with some cells transformed into amoeboid form considered to be macrophages at day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 5 days, many of the reactive microglia, notably in the ventral horn, appeared to encircle the soma of motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, the microglial reaction had subsided while astrocytes in the same area were hypertrophied to replace the perineuronal microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The microglial response in both the cerebral cortex and lumbar spinal cord was effectively reduced by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present results suggest that following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the vigorous response of microglia, and subsequently astrocytes, in the spinal cord in extra-focal areas far removed from the primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> may be mediated by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> released from the ischaemic corticospinal neurons through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors on the postsynaptic spinal cord neurons </plain></SENT>
