<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to delineate the behavioral correlates of focal thrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery in rats and to compare the pattern of deficits and subsequent recovery to that following proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten Sprague-Dawley rats underwent photothrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery with tandem occlusion of the common carotid arteries (dMCAO group); 10 animals served as operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beginning on postischemia day 2, animals were given a battery of five tests that assessed sensorimotor integration, attentional mechanisms, and muscle strength; testing continued twice weekly until day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine days of cognitive testing on the learning set of the water maze task were then given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were determined for each dMCAO animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the dMCAO group exhibited significant behavioral deficits in posture reflex, ability to place a forelimb to various stimuli, limb adduction during rearing, and neglect of contralateral space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These deficits showed variable recovery rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No deficits were observed in muscle strength or cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deficits and patterns of recovery were related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location and to degree of hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that a battery of tests is necessary to fully characterize the pattern of behavioral deficits after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage and associated degree of hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were important variables in determining behavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results are compared with those of the more traditional model of electrocoagulation of the proximal middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
