<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) transplanted into the ischemic boundary zone, survive, differentiate and improve functional recovery after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs were harvested from adult rats and cultured with or without nerve growth factor (NGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For cellular identification, MSCs were prelabeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats (n=24) were subjected to 2 h of MCAo, received grafts at 24 h and were euthanized at 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test groups consisted of: (1) control-MCAo alone (n=8); (2) intracerebral transplantation of MSCs (n=8); (3) intracerebral transplantation of MSCs cultured with NGF (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells from MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (rotarod, adhesive-removal and modified neurological severity score [NSS]) were performed before and after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that MSCs survive, migrate and differentiate into phenotypic neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery of somatosensory behavior (p&lt;0.05) and NSS (p&lt;0.05) were found in animals transplanted with MSCs compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals that received MSCs cultured with NGF displayed significant recovery in motor (p&lt;0.05), somatosensory (p&lt;0.05) and NSS (p&lt;0.05) behavioral tests compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that intracerebral transplantation of MSCs may provide a powerful autoplastic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
