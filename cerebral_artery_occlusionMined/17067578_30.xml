<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whereas behavioral impairments after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are increasingly studied in the rat, little is known about the long-term functional consequences of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, Swiss mice underwent transient (60 min) intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor (chimney, accelerating rotarod, pole, corner, adhesive removal and staircase tests) and cognitive (passive avoidance and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>) performances were regularly assessed during 1 month, after which the final histological lesion was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor coordination and balance, assessed by the chimney and rotarod tests, were transiently altered by MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002067'>bradykinesia</z:hpo> was evidenced by the pole test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most striking and long-lasting (1 month) sensorimotor deficits were postural asymmetries on the corner test, bilateral skilled forepaw reaching deficits on the staircase test and a contralateral sensorimotor impairment on the adhesive removal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAo animals showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spatial learning abilities on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test, but they displayed learning deficits measured by the passive avoidance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter deficit was significantly correlated with both cortical and striatal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of three tests that had never been reported in the mouse after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>: the adhesive removal, staircase and pole tests, which showed deficits 1 month after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and should therefore constitute meaningful tools in mice for assessing both neuroprotective and regenerative therapies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> preclinical studies </plain></SENT>
