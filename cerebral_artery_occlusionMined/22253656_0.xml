<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Baboons were chosen because of their relatively large brain volume and that they are evolutionarily close to humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced using a minimally invasive endovascular approach to guide an inflatable balloon catheter into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and followed by permanently or transiently inflate the balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multimodal MRI, including perfusion and diffusion imaging, the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of the ischemic lesions in permanent and transient occlusion experiments in baboons were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-diffusion mismatch, which approximates the ischemic penumbra, was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO group (n = 2), the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 29 ml (17% of total brain volume) whereas in the transient MCAO group (n = 2, 60 or 90 min of occlusion), the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 15 ml (9% of total brain volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substantial perfusion-diffusion mismatch tissue (~50%) was salvaged by reperfusion compared to permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This baboon <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model has the potential to become a translational platform to better design clinical studies, guide clinical diagnosis and improve treatment time windows in patients </plain></SENT>
