<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent evidence strongly suggests that endothelins (ETs) play an important role in the regulation of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of ETs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability change after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the brain tissue ET-1 content and evaluated the time and dose response of the therapeutic effects of the specific ET type A receptor (ET(A)) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, S-0139, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation, development of infarction, and disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1-hour MCAO and reperfusion, the brain ET-1 content did not change during the first 3 hours, increased at 6 hours, and rose almost continuously over 48 hours in the ischemic region as well as in the ischemic rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats infused with S-0139 (0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg per hour) during reperfusion showed dose-dependent and significant attenuation of the increase in brain water content 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the infusion of S-0139 was begun after 10 minutes and 1 hour of reperfusion, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, posttreatment with S-0139 significantly attenuated the increased Evans blue dye-quantified albumin extravasation and improved the mortality of animals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that infusion with S-0139, an ET(A) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, results in significant reduction of brain injury and plasma extravasation after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ETs may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury at least partly by increasing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability via ET(A)s </plain></SENT>
