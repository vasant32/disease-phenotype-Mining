<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-A (CsA) and anti-inflammatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MP) in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were initially subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) then randomly assigned to one of the following treatment conditions: low dose CsA, MP, low dose CsA plus MP, high dose CsA, or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic animals that received low dose CsA, MP or vehicle exhibited significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, as revealed by passive avoidance and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tasks, at days 1-3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ischemic animals that received high dose CsA exhibited near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive performance throughout the test period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic animals that received low dose CsA plus MP also showed significantly less <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> but such attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced behavioral impairments was only consistently reflected in the passive avoidance task, while performance in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task deteriorated over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis at 3 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> revealed that only those ischemic animals treated with high dose CsA had significantly reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that despite overt cerebral damage, alterations in simple, but not complex, cognitive tasks produced by MCAo could be ameliorated by low dose CsA when combined with MP </plain></SENT>
