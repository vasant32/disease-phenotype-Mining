<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into following groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, sham, model, BYHWD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats in latter three groups were subdivided into subgroups of 1, 3, and 7 days after medication, with 5 rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right side focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> model was reproduced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats in BYHWD group were gavaged with BYHWD of 10 ml/kg (14.2 g/kg, once a day) 2 hours after operation </plain></SENT>
