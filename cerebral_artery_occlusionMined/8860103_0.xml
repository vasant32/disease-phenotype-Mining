<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such FFA accumulations may signal regional <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membrane damage and are postulated to participate in the pathogenesis of progressive infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have examined the regional levels of FFAS in the cortices of cats after 8 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of specific FFAs (palmitic, stearic, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acids</z:chebi>) were 1.5 and 2.0 times higher in the penumbral and dense ischemic regions, respectively, than those in the non-ischemic contralateral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no significant differences were found between the penumbra and dense ischemic regions in the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> in both of these regions were significantly higher than those in the contralateral region (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that enhanced accumulation of FFAs are regionally distributed after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may contribute to neuronal damage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in non-rodent species </plain></SENT>
