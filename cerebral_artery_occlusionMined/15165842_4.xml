<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel neuroprotective compound AM-36, when screened for activity at the most common receptor and ion channel binding sites, revealed activity at site 2 Na+ channels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the endothelin-1 (ET-1) model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in conscious rats, both AM-36 (6 mg/kg i.p.) and sipatrigine (10 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min post-MCAo significantly reduced cortical, but not striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the refractiveness of the striatum is likely to be dependent on the route and time of drug administration, AM-36 (1 mg/kg i.v.) was administered 3 or 5 h after MCAo and significantly reduced both cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present studies demonstrate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> channel blocking activity of AM-36 both in vitro and in vivo, together with significant neuroprotection when administration is delayed up to 5 h following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
