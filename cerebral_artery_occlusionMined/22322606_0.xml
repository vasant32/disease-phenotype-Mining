<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recanalization with the Wingspan stent, which can be deployed rapidly and safely, is an option for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> when intravenous thrombolysis has failed or is contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate feasibility, efficacy, and safety of recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using the Wingspan stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in whom recanalization was not achieved with a standard intravenous thrombolysis, or who were ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis, or who presented after 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and in whom the stent placement could be completed within 8 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed angiographic and clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful recanalization with the Wingspan stent was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score on admission was 12.7 points (range 4-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occlusion sites were located in the 1st segment (n = 7; 2 left, 5 right) and 2nd segment (n = 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> right) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to stent placement was 344.8 ± 76.3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, or dissections occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients improved on the NIHSS at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient did not have a change in the NIHSS score, even though the occluded artery was completely recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, the NIHSS score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 4.4 ± 4.7 (median 4, range 0-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At discharge, an mRS of ≤ 3 was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and an mRS of ≤ 2 was achieved in 7 patients (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This small case series demonstrates the feasibility of using the Wingspan stent safely and effectively for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions when standard treatments are ineffective or not available </plain></SENT>
