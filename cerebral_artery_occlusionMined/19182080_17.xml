<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent placement has been applied in small case series as a rescue therapy in combination with different thrombolytic agents, percutaneous balloon angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>), and mechanical thromboembolectomy (MT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies report a considerable mortality and a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> when balloon-mounted stents were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate feasibility, efficacy, and safety of intracranial artery recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> using a self-expandable stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with an intracranial stent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment comprised intraarterial thrombolysis, thromboaspiration, MT, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization result was assessed by follow-up angiography immediately after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications related to the procedure and outcome at 3 months were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (median NIHSS 14, mean age 63 years) were treated with intracranial stents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occlusions were located in the posterior vertebrobasilar circulation (n=6) and in the anterior circulation (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stent placement was feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures and resulted in partial or complete recanalization (TIMI 2/3) in 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, subarachnoid, or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One dissection was found after thromboaspiration and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients (25%) had a good outcome (mRS 0 to 2), 3 (25%) a moderate outcome (mRS 3), and 6 (50%) a poor outcome (mRS 4 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial placement of a self-expandable stent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is feasible and seems to be safe to achieve sufficient recanalization </plain></SENT>
