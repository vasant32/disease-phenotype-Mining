<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, we found that a novel subtype of prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2)) receptor clearly distinct from the peripheral subtype in terms of ligand specificity is expressed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(15R)-16-m-tolyl-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin (15R-TIC) was synthesized and demonstrated to be a specific ligand for this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we demonstrated 15R-TIC to be neuroprotective in vivo during transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbils and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this compound was shown to exert an anti-apoptotic effect on primary cultured hippocampal neurons, indicating its neuroprotective effect against ischemic insults occurs via direct action on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Local cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured simultaneously by using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography with the (15)O steady-state method, before and up to 18 hours after 3-hour transient MCAO reperfusion in cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">Methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> of 15R-TIC (50 microg/kg, n=4) or its vehicle (10% Intralipos, n=4) was injected intravenously within 5 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO and continuously infused for 5 hours (50 microg/kg per hour) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuropathology showed that 15R-TIC significantly reduced cortical damage after 3-hour MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography results showed 15R-TIC significantly reduced the volume of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>" region of interest and attenuated the decrease in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and oxygen extraction fraction, and these protective effects were not attributable to improvement of cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 15R-TIC has a potent neuroprotective effect against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a monkey MCAO via its direct action on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2) receptors </plain></SENT>
