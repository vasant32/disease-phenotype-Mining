<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study was conducted to examine whether swelling of the brain due to vasogenic-type and cytotoxic-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is isotropic or anisotropic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was induced by cryogenic injury in cats, and coronal sections of the brain were examined at 4-5 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The swelling of the edematous white matter longitudinal to and transverse to the subcortical neuronal fibers was 2.3% and 91.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was examined using cortical tissue specimens of cat brain subjected to either middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 h or immersion in saline after decapitation for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The swelling parallel to the left-right axis, caudo-rostral axis and antero-posterior axis was 9.6%, 10.1% and 8.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroglial cell swelling was prominent in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus swelling of the white matter in vasogenic-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was anisotropic, whereas that of gray matter in cytotoxic-type (ischemic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was isotropic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observed difference in the biomechanical properties of brain tissue should be taken into account when the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-mediated tissue injury, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is investigated </plain></SENT>
