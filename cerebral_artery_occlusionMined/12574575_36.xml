<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We and others have previously reported that bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), given before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), reduces ischemic injury in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that receptors for BMP are upregulated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is possible that this upregulation may facilitate endogenous neurorepair in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the neuroregenerative effects of BMP-7 given parenterally after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded by a filament inserted through the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The filament was removed after 60-minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to allow reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some animals were killed 24 hours after MCAO to examine BMP-7 mRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other animals received a single dose of intravenous BMP-7 or vehicle at 24 hours after MCAO and were used for subsequent behavioral studies and BMP-7 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMP-7 mRNA was upregulated 24 hours after MCAO in untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMP-7 immunoreactivity was dose-dependently increased on the ischemic side of the hippocampus/dentate on day 6 after MCAO in animals receiving intravenous injection of BMP-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving BMP-7 also showed a decrease in body asymmetry from day 7 to day 14 and an increase in locomotor activity on day 14 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that BMP-7, given parenterally after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, can pass through the blood-brain barrier on the ischemic side and induce behavioral recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals at longer testing times </plain></SENT>
