<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether neuronal damage in rats could be characterized by iomazenil as compared with cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial changes in I-125-iomazenil for BZR and I-123-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> for CBF were analyzed after the unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats by using an in vivo dualtracer technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uptake ratios of affected to contralateral regions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The iomazenil as well as <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions except for the cerebellum (remote area) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both iomazenil and <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> increased over time except in the temporal region (ischemic core) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The iomazenil uptake was higher than <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> except in the ischemic core between 1 and 3-4 wk when iomazenil was lower than <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iomazenil showed a moderate decrease in the proximal and middle parietal regions (peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas) at 3-4 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The triphenyl-tetrazolium-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) stain at 1 wk demonstrated unstained tissue in the temporal region indicating tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) stain at 1 wk, widespread neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with occasional intact neurons were found in the proximal parietal region, and isolated necrotic neurons were represented in the distal parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Iomazenil correlated well with the neuron distribution and the finding of a discrepancy between iomazenil and <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> might be useful in evaluating the neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
