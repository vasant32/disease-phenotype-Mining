<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of the opiate <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> on both the neurological deficit and regional cortical blood flow after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the cat was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animals with mild symptoms, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> did not consistently produce a significant behavioral effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats with neurological deficits, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, 2 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> administered intravenously 4 h after the ischemic lesion produced a reversal of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect began within 2 min following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> injection and lasted for approximately 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were then anesthetized and cortical blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average cortical blood flow on the side of the occlusion was 50% that of the control side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> produced a significant additional decrease of 19.5% in cortical blood flow in the ischemic hemisphere, whereas no effect on blood flow on the control side was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> appears to temporarily reverse the severe neurological deficits resulting from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the cat, this effect appears to be accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow to the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
