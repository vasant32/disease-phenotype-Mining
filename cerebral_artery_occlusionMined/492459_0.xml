<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, first described by Bramwell, is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> due to the hemispheric damage on the side of handedness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in a dextral is rare, and in Japan, there have not been more than ten cases in which the lesion is localized clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases reported till now have been verified mainly by necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the time lag between the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and the necropsy may affect the conclusion subtly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider that computed tomography (CT) can obtain almost the same findings as that by necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at present there have been few cases diagnosed by CT except two cases reported by April et al. and Wechsler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have reported a 47-year-old man in a dextral, who shows left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and Broca's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His lesion is diagnosed by cerebral angiography and CT as the right hemisphere infarction due to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT localizes the lesion on the right hemisphere mainly sited deep region and sited wedge shaped cortical area of the fronto-parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it localizes no lesion on the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> has been already reported by Hayward et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In their report they concluded that correlation of lesion located by CT with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> type supported Geschwind's concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this report we have discussed CT in crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> analysing our case and the two cases by April et al. and Wechsler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three cases including our case are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Broca's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and we compare the lesion location of these three cases with Hayward's lesion located on Broca's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the result of this, we can draw the conclusion that the lesion location by CT of these three cases and that of Hayward's report are almost symmetric </plain></SENT>
