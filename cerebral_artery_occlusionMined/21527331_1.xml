<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is substantial experimental evidence to support the view that Ginkgo biloba extracts have neuroprotective properties under conditions such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a number of studies have investigated that ginkgolide B, a purified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37668">terpene lactone</z:chebi> component extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves, is available "platelet activating factor (PAF) receptors <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>", "<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>" with a variety of actions, very little has been performed to explore the effect of ginkgolide B on extracellular amino acids in experimental animal of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of ginkgolide B on the striatal extracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), glycine (Gly) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) was evaluated in rats undergone middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1h followed by 23 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intraperitoneal injections of ginkgolide B dissolved at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1)d(-1), 20 mg kg(-1)d(-1), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (NS) of same volume 3d before the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, aspartic acid, glycine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in striatum were monitored using in vivo microdialysis and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxic index (EI) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was detected on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The result showed that administration of ginkgolide B (10 or 20 mg kg(-1)) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced elevation of levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, aspartic acid and glycine, increased the elevation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, decreased the excitotoxic index and diminished the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, although a clear concentration-response relationship was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides the first evidence that ginkgolide B protects against cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting excitotoxicity by modulating the imbalance of excitatory amino acids versus inhibitory amino acids, which may support the traditional use of Ginkgo biloba leaves for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
