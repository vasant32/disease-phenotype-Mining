<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and the protein level of serine racemase were assayed by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16523,29998">D-serine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> were measured by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High levels of serine racemase were constitutively expressed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex of mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At early stage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), no significant change in expression of serine racemase was observed in temporoparietal cortex in ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, delayed transient decreases of serine racemase in both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were detected from d 6 to d 10 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16523,29998">D-serine</z:chebi> concentration also declined in the ipsilateral cortex during this period when compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16523,29998">D-serine</z:chebi> level in the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed decreases in serine racemase expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16523,29998">D-serine</z:chebi> level occurred in the temporoparietal cortex at the late stage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
