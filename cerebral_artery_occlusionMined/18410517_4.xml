<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also known that the brain may undergo apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via extrinsic, or receptor-mediated pathways, such as that triggered by Fas/FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 2 h intraischemic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) were assayed for Fas, FasL and caspase-8 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> increased Fas, but decreased FasL by approximately 50-60% at 6 and 24 h post-insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly reduced expression of Fas and processed caspase-8 both by approximately 50%, but prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced FasL decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fractionation revealed that soluble/shed FasL (sFasL) was decreased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, while membrane-bound FasL (mFasL) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To more directly assess the significance of the Fas/FasL pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, primary neuron cultures were exposed to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since FasL is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> decreases MMP expression, treatment with a pan-MMP inhibitor also decreased sFasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is associated with reduced Fas expression and caspase-8 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> prevented total FasL decreases, and most of it remained membrane-bound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal new observations regarding the effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the Fas/FasL and MMP systems </plain></SENT>
