<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Orexin-A (a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensing neuropeptide in the hypothalamus) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; a member of the neurotrophin family) play roles in many physiologic functions, including regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that the development of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> is one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an interaction between orexin-A and BDNF functions in the hypothalamus after cerebral ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was estimated by histologic and behavioral analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of protein levels was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> directed BDNF, orexin-A, and SB334867 [N-(2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-benzoxazolyl)-N'-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>; a specific orexin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>] were administered directly into the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of hypothalamic orexin-A, detected by immunohistochemistry, was decreased on day 1 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A (1 or 5 pmol/mouse) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the development of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> on day 1 and development of neuronal damage on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MCAO-induced decrease in insulin receptor levels in the liver and skeletal muscle on day 1 was recovered to control levels by orexin-A, and this effect of orexin-A was reversed by the administration of SB334867 as well as by hypothalamic BDNF knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that suppression of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> by orexin-A assists in the prevention of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, hypothalamic BDNF may play an important role in this effect of orexin-A </plain></SENT>
