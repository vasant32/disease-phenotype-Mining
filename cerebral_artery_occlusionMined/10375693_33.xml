<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to validate a modified method of temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the mouse; neurobehavioral function and histopathological infarction were quantitated following various periods of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with 3% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> in a mixture of 30%O2/70%<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> delivered by face mask and were subjected to 30- to 180-min of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by an intraluminal suture coated with poly-l-lysine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of 40 mice showed an initial high-grade neurological deficit (30-min MCAo, n=7; 60-min, n=8; 120-min, n=8; 180-min, n=5) when examined during MCAo; these were used for subsequent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after MCAo, behavioral function was re-evaluated, and brains were perfusion-fixed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial neurological deficit improved at 24 h in mice with 30- or 60-min of prior MCAo but tended to persist in mice with 120- or 180-min insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following each duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mice exhibited ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small, inconsistent predominantly subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present after 30-min MCAo, while longer occlusion periods gave rise to consistent foci of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> involving striatum, septum, thalamus, and hippocampus, as well as areas of frontoparietal cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major advantages of the improved intraluminal MCAo model reported here, incorporating sutures coated with poly-l-lysine, include: a 100% incidence of infarction of predictable location and size in mice having an initial neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Periods of 60- to 180-min <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in this model yield sufficiently reproducible sequelae to permit the effects of various therapeutic agents on neurological outcome and size of infarction to be readily studied </plain></SENT>
