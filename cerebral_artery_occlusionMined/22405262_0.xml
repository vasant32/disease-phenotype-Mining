<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> increases human umbilical cord blood cell (HUCBC) migration into the ischemic brain and promotes brain plasticity and neurological functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and administered subtherapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg, gavaged daily for 7 days), HUCBCs (1 Ã— 10(6), one time injection via tail vein), or combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> with HUCBCs starting at 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed an interactive effect in improvement of neurological outcome compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> or HUCBC monotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, combination treatment significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB expression and the number of engrafted HUCBCs in the ischemic brain compared with HUCBC monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of engrafted HUCBCs was significantly correlated with functional outcome (modified neurological severity score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment significantly increased neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the ischemic brain, and promoted neuroblast migration in cultured subventricular zone explants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using primary cultured neurons (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCNs</z:chebi>), we found that combination treatment enhanced neurite outgrowth compared with nontreatment control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> or HUCBC supernatant monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of TrkB significantly attenuated combination treatment-induced neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and HUCBC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases BDNF/TrkB expression, enhances HUCBC migration into the ischemic brain, amplifies endogenous neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and axonal growth, and thereby improves functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
