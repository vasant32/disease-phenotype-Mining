<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that stress-induced <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> reduction contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> tolerance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In intact male rats, stress was induced by brief anesthesia at 6 h before transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels were significantly decreased 6 h after stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> reduction was associated with a 50% reduction in cerebral lesion volume in the stressed animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> tolerance was eliminated by <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> replacement in castrated males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptors were up-regulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury and partially colocalized with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells in the parietal cortex and extensively colocalized in the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) are involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> tolerance, and were not colocalized with TUNEL in the immunohistochemical staining, suggesting an antiapoptotic role of Hsp's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> on MCAO-induced Hsp70 and -90 expression, a <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> replacement or withdrawal paradigm was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi>-replaced animals exhibited a decrease in Hsp expression, whereas <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> withdrawal (mimicking the stress-induced <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> suppression) normalized this deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, stress-induced <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> reduction contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> tolerance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in males, which could be related to the loss of inhibition by <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> of Hsp70 and -90 expression </plain></SENT>
