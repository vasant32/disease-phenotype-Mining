<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tight-junction (TJ) protein degradation is a decisive step in hypoxic blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we elucidated the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on TJ protein arrangement and the role of the apoptotic effector protease caspase-3 in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used an in vitro model of the neurovascular unit and the guinea pig whole brain preparation to analyze with immunohistochemical methods the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> properties and neurovascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both methodological approaches we observed rapid TJ protein disruptions after 30 min of oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which were accompanied by strong caspase-3 activation in brain endothelial cells (BEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly only few DNA-fragmentations were detected with TUNEL stainings in BEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Z-DEVD-fmk, an irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor, partly blocked TJ disruptions and was protective on trans-endothelial electrical resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide evidence that caspase-3 is rapidly activated during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> predominantly without triggering DNA-fragmentation in BEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further we detected fast TJ protein disruptions which could be partly blocked by caspase-3 inhibition with Z-DEVD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the basis for clinically relevant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown in form of TJ disruptions is initiated within minutes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that caspase-3 contributes to this process </plain></SENT>
