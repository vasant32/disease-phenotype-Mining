<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (body temperature 24 degrees C) was induced before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (0-minute delay group) in six rats, at 30 minutes in eight rats, and at 1 (seven rats), 2 (seven rats), and 3 (nine rats) hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were kept at a 24 degrees C body temperature for 1 hour, then allowed to rewarm over 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and infarction was visualized by staining of coronal sections with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were compared to matched normothermic control rats (body temperature 36 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional groups of 0-minute delay hypothermic (10 rats) and control animals (nine rats) were sacrificed 72 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion to examine the effects of prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in the percentage of infarcted right hemisphere was seen in the animals sacrificed after 24 hours with 0-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour delays in inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 2.2% +/- 0.7%, 4.4% +/- 0.9%, and 3.6% +/- 1.1%, respectively) as compared to normothermic control rats (10.8% +/- 1.5%, p less than 0.01 by Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 2- and 3-hour delay groups, the percentage of infarcted right hemisphere was 17.1% +/- 2.4% and 12.0% +/- 2.7%, respectively, and no decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 0-minute delay <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group sacrificed after 72 hours also displayed a significant reduction in right hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> compared to their respective controls (4.8% vs. 11.7%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that, in the setting of permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> markedly decreases brain injury even when its induction is delayed for up to 1 hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
