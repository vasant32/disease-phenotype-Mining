<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> was induced by transient left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 60 min in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CRMP-4, nestin and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was analyzed by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The co-localization of CRMP-4 and nestin or BrdU was analyzed by double staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRMP-4, a marker of immature neuron, could be expressed in the ipsilateral striatum and cerebral cortex at 1st and 2nd week after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion; nestin, a marker of neural stem cell, occurred in above regions from several hours to 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRMP-4 costained with nestin and with BrdU incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neural stem cells may present in the striatum and cerebral cortex of adult rat and can be triggered to differentiate into newborn neuron there by ischemic brain trauma </plain></SENT>
