<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Four male Sprague-Dawley rats (3-6 months old) were subjected to 90 min of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under anesthesia with 1.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>/air followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples (~100 µl) were collected at baseline, at the end of 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at 24-h postreperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain injuries were assessed by MRI at 24-h postreperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative comparison of global plasma protein expression was performed using 2D differential in-gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed protein spots were identified using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequencing tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These rats had clear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the left hemisphere detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three protein spots of plasma samples were differentially expressed following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These protein spots belonged to eight proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of them (α2-macroglobulin, complement C3, inter-α- trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3, serum albumin, haptoglobin and transthyretin), which are a class of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins, changed significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study describes the responses of young rats to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and suggests that future studies should use aged animals to better mimic the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
