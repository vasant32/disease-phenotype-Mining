<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurite growth inhibitory proteins such as Nogo-A play a critical role in impeding regain of function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reported that treatment with anti-Nogo-A antibody using the intracerebroventricular route resulted in improvement of function and neuroplasticity in adult or aged rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This present study tested a more clinically accessible route for applying anti-Nogo-A antibodies, the intrathecal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-Nogo-A or control antibody was administered intrathecally at lower lumbar levels 1 week after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that anti-Nogo-A antibody delivered by this intrathecal route for 2 weeks penetrated into brain parenchyma and bound to myelin-enriched structures such as the corpus callosum and striatal white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment significantly improved recovery of function on the skilled forelimb reaching task as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> only and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/control antibody animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that anti-Nogo-A antibody delivered through the intrathecal route is as effective in restoring lost functions after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as the intracerebroventricular route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is of great importance for the future application of anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
