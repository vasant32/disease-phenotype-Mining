<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stimulation of the nerves traversing the ethmoidal foramen (including postsynaptic, parasympathetic projections from the sphenopalatine ganglion [SPG], henceforth referred to as "SPG-stimulation") has been shown to elevate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and to be neuroprotective after permanent, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Employing diffusion (DWI)- and perfusion (PWI) weighted MRI, the effect of SPG-stimulation (started at 60 minutes post-MCAO) on the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during and after pMCAO was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an additional experiment, regional CBF changes were investigated in the nonischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the nonischemic brain, SPG stimulation significantly elevated CBF predominantly within areas supplied by the anterior cerebral artery (by 0.64 mL/g/min relative to baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic brain, CBF only marginally increased within the penumbra and core (by up to 0.08 and 0.15 mL/g/min relative to prestimulation, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the threshold-derived CBF lesion volume did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Penumbral apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>)-values improved to almost baseline values and the threshold derived <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>/CBF-mismatch was preserved up to 180 minutes after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTC-derived lesion volumes were significantly smaller in stimulated versus nonstimulated animals (120.4+/-74.1 mm(3) versus 239.3+/-68.5 mm(3), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that unilateral SPG-stimulation increases CBF bilaterally within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, acutely preserves the CBF/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> mismatch largely independent of altering cerebral blood flow, and reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the rat permanent suture model </plain></SENT>
