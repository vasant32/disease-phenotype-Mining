<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit have not been ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study focused on the contribution of neurotrophic and growth factors produced by BMSCs to therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the ischemic brain extract supernatant was collected to prepare the conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The counterpart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain extract from non-ischemic rats was employed as the experimental control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using microarray assay, we measured the changes of the neurotrophin associated gene expression profile in BMSCs cultured in different media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR and fluorescent immunocytochemistry were utilized to validate the gene changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of BMSCs, cultured in the ischemic brain-conditioned medium for 12 h, was dramatically altered from a polygonal and flat appearance to a fibroblast-like long and thin cell appearance, compared to those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain-conditioned medium and the serum replacement medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-four neurotrophin-associated genes in BMSCs were identified by microarray assay under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of the 44 genes (7 neurotrophic and growth factor genes, 5 receptor genes) increased in BMSCs cultured in the ischemic brain-conditioned medium compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain-conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Real time RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry validated that the ischemic brain-conditioned medium significantly increased 6/7 neurotrophic and growth factor genes, compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain-conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These six genes consisted of fibroblast growth factor 2, insulin-like growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor A, nerve growth factor beta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and epidermal growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that transplanted BMSCs may work as 'small molecular factories' by secreting neurotrophins, growth factors and other supportive substances after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which may produce therapeutic benefits in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
