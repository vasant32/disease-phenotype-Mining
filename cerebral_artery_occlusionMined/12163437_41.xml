<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in the intravascular space is beneficial, whereas its extravascular effect on ischemic neurons is deleterious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that neuroserpin, a natural inhibitor of tPA, reduces tPA-induced neuronal toxicity and increases its therapeutic window for treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brains were treated with neuroserpin in combination with recombinant human tPA (n=7), tPA alone (n=7), or saline (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroserpin (20 micro L of 16 micro mol/L active neuroserpin) was intracisternally injected 3 hours and tPA (10 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 4 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed to study blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage and ischemic lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of tPA alone 4 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage in the ischemic core measured by Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI compared with rats treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with neuroserpin in combination with tPA significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and ischemic lesion volume compared with rats treated with tPA alone, although ischemic lesion volumes were the same in both groups before the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining revealed that MCAO resulted in reduction of neuroserpin immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere after 2 to 6 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Zymographic assay showed increased plasminogen activity in areas with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage in rats treated with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of neuroserpin after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is neuroprotective, seemingly because it blocks the extravascular effect of tPA, leading to subsequent decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and widening of the therapeutic window for the thrombolytic effect of tPA </plain></SENT>
