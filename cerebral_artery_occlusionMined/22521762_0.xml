<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Matrine has been proven to protect ischemic injury in brain and sophoridine (SOP) is an isomeride of matrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether SOP has this protective effect on ischemic injury in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the potential neuroprotective role of SOP and the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into five groups: Vehicle (pMCAO+saline), High dose (pMCAO+SOP 10 mg/kg), Middle dose (pMCAO+SOP 5 mg/kg), Low dose (pMCAO+SOP 2.5 mg/kg) and Sham operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model was used and SOP was administered intraperitoneally immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and once daily in the following days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was evaluated using a modified six point scale; brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of TRAF6 and ERK1/2 were measured by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with Vehicle group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was alleviated in High dose group (P&lt;0.05), and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was decreased in Low dose group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis indicated that TRAF6 expression was significantly decreased in SOP administrated groups at 24 h, and the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased in Low dose at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SOP protected the brain from damage caused by pMCAO, and this effect may be through down-regulation of TRAF6 expression and up-regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation expression </plain></SENT>
