<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of acupoint sticking of "Hua yutie" in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, a model group, an acupoint sticking group, an acupuncture group, a Nimodipine group and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was used for preparation of focal cerebral ischemic rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After modeling, any treatment was not given to the model group; for the acupoint sticking group, "Hua yutie" was applied at "Dazhui" (GV 14) ,"Qihai" (CV 6) and "Mingmen" (GV 4); for the acupuncture group, acupuncture was given at the same acupoints as those in the acupoint sticking group; the Nimodipine group received intragastric administration of Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group did not receive any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their infarction volume, the cerebral water content, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the protein level were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infarction volume coincided with the dominative scope of the middle cerebral artery of the electric coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the cerebral water content as the various treatment groups compared with that of the model group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VEGF positive cell number and the protein level around the infarction area in the acupoint sticking group were increased as compared with those in the model group (P&lt;0.01), with no significant difference as compared with the Nimodipine group and the acupuncture group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acupoint sticking of "Hua yutie" alleviates the cerebral damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> possibly through enhancing the expression and protein level of VEGF </plain></SENT>
