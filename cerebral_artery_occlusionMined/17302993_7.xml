<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the detailed mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMPZ) in inflammatory and apoptotic responses induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MCAO-induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha(HIF-1alpha), activation of caspase-3, and TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription in ischemic regions were detected by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-oxidative activity was investigated using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substance (TBARS) test in rat brain homogenate preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed the statistical results of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas of solvent- and TMPZ (20 mg/kg)-treated groups at various distances from the frontal pole in MCAO-induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TMPZ (20 mg/kg) markedly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, especially in the third to fifth sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO-induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was associated with increases in HIF-1alpha and the activation of caspase-3, as well as TNF-alpha transcription in ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These expressions were markedly inhibited by treatment with TMPZ (20 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, TMPZ (0.5-5 mmol/L) did not significantly inhibit TBARS reaction in rat brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effect of TMPZ may be mediated at least by a portion of the inhibition of HIF-1alpha and TNF-alpha activations, followed by the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> formation (active caspase-3), resulting in a reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, TMPZ treatment may represent an ideal approach to lowering the risk of or improving function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>- reperfusion brain injury-related disorders </plain></SENT>
