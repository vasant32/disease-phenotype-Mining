<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29749">ferulate</z:chebi> (SF), an intravenous drug made from traditional Chinese herbs, on activation of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and neuroprotection after transient cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 2 groups (n=23 in each group): the control group and the SF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was conducted with the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was assessed with the method devised by Bederson et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was used to assess the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We adopted a modified six-point scale to conduct neurobehavioral evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately the activation of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) was studied with Western blot analysis system in the cortex and striatum of rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurologic deficit score of the SF group decreased substantially compared with that of the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the control group (168.1 mm3 +/- 42.2 mm3) was significantly larger than that of the SF group (61.5 mm3 +/- 28.7 mm3) at 24 hours after reperfusion (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the rats showed some neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The activity of PSD-95 in the SF group at most timepoints was less than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No upregulation of PSD-95 protein could be detected in the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29749">ferulate</z:chebi> can induce a neuroprotective effect against the transient focal cerebral ischemic injury and weaken the activation of PSD-95 in ischemic area after MCAO </plain></SENT>
