<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is mediated by delayed proinflammatory signaling and immune cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it remains unknown which cell surface markers signify a proinflammatory phenotype, increased isolectin binding occurs on CD11b-expressing immune cells within injured brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several reports have confirmed the efficacy of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cell therapy in reducing ischemic injury in rat after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and these effects were attributed in part to dampened neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the time course of lectin binding to cells of microglia/macrophage lineage within 96 hr after MCAO and whether delayed HUCB cell treatment alters the migration and/or morphological characteristics of these cells throughout the period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolectin binding was up-regulated in response to injury, was maximal at 96 hr, and colocalized with cells that expressed the putative proinflammatory markers MMP-9 and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolectin-tagged fluorescence was also significantly increased at 72 hr and localized to greater numbers of amoeboid, CD11b-expressing cells relative to 51 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 1 x 10(6) HUCB cells significantly reduced total lectin binding at 72 hr, as well as the total area occupied by lectin-tagged fluorescence at both 51 and 72 hr, relative to vehicle-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was accompanied by a shift in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of CD11b-positive cells from amoeboid to ramified shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that HUCB cell therapy suppressed the recruitment of proinflammatory, isolectin-binding cells during the period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion, thus offering a potential mechanism for the protective effects of HUCB cell therapy </plain></SENT>
