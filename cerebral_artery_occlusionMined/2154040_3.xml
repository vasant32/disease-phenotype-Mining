<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the time course of metabolite production, subtemporal craniectomies were performed on 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> while 30 rats underwent craniectomy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five rats in each of two groups (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and sham) were sacrificed at 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral hemispheres were removed and divided in the midsagittal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each hemisphere was immediately frozen in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30362">isopentane</z:chebi> cooled in dry ice and stored at -70 degrees C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In pretreated rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> were not affected by meclofenamate </plain></SENT>
