<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ligustilide, the main lipophilic component of Danggui, has been reported to protect the brain against ischaemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the roles of erythropoietin (EPO) and the stress-induced protein RTP801 in neuroprotection provided by ligustilide against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) damage to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The efficacy of ligustilide against I/R damage was assessed by neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and cell viability, using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats in vivo and rat cultured neurons in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPO and RTP801 were analysed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of RTP801 was achieved by transfection of an expression plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Ligustilide decreased the neurological deficit score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and RTP801 expression and increased EPO transcription in I/R rats, and increased cell viability and EPO and decreased LDH release and RTP801 in I/R neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, ligustilide increased ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive effects of ligustilide on p-ERK, cell viability and EPO were blocked by PD98059, but not LY294002 and SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with RTP801 plasmid increased RTP801 and LDH release, while ligustilide inhibited the effects of transfection on RTP801 expression and also increased cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Ligustilide exerts neuroprotective effects against I/R injury by promoting EPO transcription via an ERK signalling pathway and inhibiting RTP801 expression, This compound could be developed into a therapeutic agent to prevent and treat ischaemic disorders </plain></SENT>
