<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty adult cats anesthetized lightly with ketamine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> underwent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten cats were not treated and 10 cats received DMSO (2.5 g/kg i.v.) immediately after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in the right sylvian region were similar in the untreated and treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean rCBF before occlusion was 46 +/- 10 ml/100 g/minute in the untreated group and 45 +/- 10 ml/100 g/minute in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight cats in both groups had rCBF measurements consistently below 18 ml/100 g/minute during the 6-hour period after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An index of erythrocyte flow was determined by measuring the transit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">technetium-99</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi>)-labeled erythrocytes in the right sylvian region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The period of erythrocyte transit before occlusion was 10 +/- 1 seconds in the untreated group and 10 +/- 2 seconds in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6 hours of occlusion, the erythrocyte transit time was 18 +/- 3 seconds in the untreated group and 19 +/- 3 seconds in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing delay in erythrocyte transit during the 6-hour occlusion period was seen in 5 untreated cats and 6 treated cats and was thought to represent a progressive increase in microvascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The complete washout of erythrocytes indicated the absence of microcirculatory obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography (EEG) showed a reduced amplitude of activity in the right cerebral hemisphere after occlusion in cats with an rCBF consistently below 18 ml/100 g/minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant EEG differences were found between the untreated and treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with DMSO failed to modify the developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, neuronal alterations, or the changes in blood-brain barrier permeability to Evans blue dye and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study DMSO was ineffective in preventing ischemic damage or acted when irreversible injury had already taken place </plain></SENT>
