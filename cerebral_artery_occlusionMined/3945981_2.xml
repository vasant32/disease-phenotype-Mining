<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined utilizing the hydrogen clearance technique from electrode recordings within the gray matter and white matter of the ectosylvian gyrus of both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) was obtained during contralateral median nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was clipped the white and gray matter blood flows in the ipsilateral ectosylvian gyrus were reduced to 14.8 +/- 19.6% and 19.3 +/- 23.7% of control, and the cortical component of the SSEP was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere an average increase of 3.5% above the control latency and a 10% mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the amplitude of the cortical component of the SSEP were observed following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF in the contralateral hemisphere was unaffected by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infusion of saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> to lower the hematocrit by approximately 45% did not significantly improve blood flow or restore the SSEP in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, significant increases in the contralateral hemisphere gray matter CBF occurred following hemodilution while the latency of the cortical component of the SSEP in this same hemisphere was significantly extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevations in gray and white matter blood flows were achieved in the experimental hemisphere of 3 of 10 cats suggesting a wide range of variation in the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
