<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TSB at 5 and 25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection significantly reduced the focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, cerebral histological damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) compared to MCAO rats receiving vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that TSB was effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced brain damage and may represent a novel drug candidate for further development </plain></SENT>
