<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the contribution of ERbeta, using the selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> diarylpropiolnitrile (DPN), in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lister Hooded rats were ovariectomized and implanted with mini-pumps containing either DPN (8 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) (n=7) or vehicle (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor function was assessed using a neurological score and the spontaneous forelimb use asymmetry (cylinder) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week later the animals received a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and T(2)-weighted MRI at 48 h post-MCAO quantified ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was tested for 7 days post-MCAO and brains processed for histological verification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MRI images revealed no significant differences in hemispheric lesion volumes between vehicle- and DPN-treated groups (35.6+/-3.5% and 30.8+/-1.7%, respectively [mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]; Student's unpaired t-test df=10, t=-1.357, p=0.453); this was confirmed histologically at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCAO induced significant decline in neurological score performance (from 22 to 11 at 2 h post-MCAO) in the vehicle-treated animals, which was not significantly influenced by DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO also induced significant changes in forelimb use in the cylinder test (10% reduction in contralateral, 20% reduction in both, and 30% increase in ipsilateral forelimb use) but this response was not significantly different between groups [F(1,1)=2.929, p=0.118, repeated-measures ANOVA] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pretreatment with the ERbeta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> DPN did not influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size or sensorimotor function in rats exposed to MCAO </plain></SENT>
