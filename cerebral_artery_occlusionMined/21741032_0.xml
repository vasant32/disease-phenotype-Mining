<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We characterized the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) axis and evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (GC) in the clinical outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneous hypertensive rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) and developed a cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 4h post-PMCAO or sham operation, serum levels of ACTH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> (CS) were elevated 5 and 4 fold respectively as compared to controls and then returned to basal levels at 24h post surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these experimental groups we found also a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of median eminence (ME)-CRH(41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adrenalectomized (Adx) rats that underwent PMCAO the degree of motor disability and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was similar to that of intact rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Dex) to Adx-PMCAO rats significantly improved the motor disability and decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in sham-Adx with PMCAO, Dex had no effect on these two parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In rats with PMCAO or sham-PMCAO, brain production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was further enhanced in Adx-PMCAO rats and significantly inhibited by Dex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, activation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis following PMCAO is due to stress induced by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This activation is mediated by hypothalamic CRH(41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Absence of endogenous GC or administration of Dex in na√Øve rats does not alter motor and pathological parameters in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage following PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, administration of Dex significantly improved the outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in Adx rats which may be due to increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Brain production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) does not play an important role in the pathophysiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
