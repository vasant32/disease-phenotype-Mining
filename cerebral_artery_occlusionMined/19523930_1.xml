<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phosphocreatine-Mg-complex <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (PCr-Mg-CPLX) is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-derived compound that in previous in vitro research was able to increase neuronal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> independently of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> transporter, thus providing hope to cure the hereditary syndrome of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> transporter deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous research we showed that it reproduces in vitro the known neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> against anoxic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present paper we investigated if PCr-Mg-CPLX reproduces this neuroprotective effect in vivo, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice received PCr-Mg-CPLX or a mixture of the two separate compounds phosphocreatine (PCr) and MgSO(4), or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The injections were done 60 min and 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> neurological damage was evaluated with Clark's behavioural tests, then the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCr-Mg-CPLX reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 48%, an effect that was not duplicated by the separate administration of PCr and MgSO(4) and the neurological damage was decreased in a statistically significant way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PCr-Mg-CPLX affords in vivo neuroprotection when administered before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are comparable to previous research on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> administration in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PCr-Mg-CPLX maintains <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-like neuroprotective effects in vivo as well as in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that PCr-Mg-CPLX might have a therapeutic role in the treatment of hereditary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> transporter deficiency and of conditions where there is a high risk of impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or cerebral ischemic damage, like high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, open heart surgery, and carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
