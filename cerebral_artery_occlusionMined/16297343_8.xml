<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of scutellarin, a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> extracted from Erigeron breviscapus Hand Mazz, against neuronal damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated ig with scutellarin for 7 d and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit were determined by TTC staining and Longa's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The permeability of the blood-brain barrier was evaluated by measurement of the Evans blue (EB) content in the brain with a spectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total NOx content was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) isoforms (iNOS, eNOS, nNOS) and the key angiogenic molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), were detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Scutellarin significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), ameliorated the neurological deficit and reduced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When rats were pretreated with scutellarin (50 or 75 mg/kg), upregulation of eNOS expression and downregulation of VEGF, bFGF, and iNOS expression was observed, whereas scutellarin had no effect on nNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scutellarin has protective effects for cerebral injury through regulating the expression of NOS isoforms and angiogenic molecules </plain></SENT>
