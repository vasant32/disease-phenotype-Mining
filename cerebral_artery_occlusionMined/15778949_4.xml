<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution and functional consequences of exclusive subcortical or cortico-subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was conducted in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO was induced in male Wistar rats (260-300 g) for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes and absolute T2 times on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were assessed 1 and 14 days after MCAO using a 4.7-T MRI animal scanner in conjunction with functional testing (adhesive tape removal, cylinder test, and ledged beam walking) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Functional test scores were not distinguishable between sham-operated animals (N = 5) and those with exclusive caudoputaminal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (N = 8; group cp), but showed significant deficits in animals with cortico-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> (N = 10; group cp+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cp group had lower absolute T2 times and a more pronounced reduction in T2 lesion volume over time than the subcortical component in the cp+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of T2 lesion size or absolute T2 times and functional impairment in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When judged from functional tests alone, subcortical ischemic lesions may not be diagnosed reliably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, T2-weighted (T2-w) MRI does not well anticipate functional deficits in primarily striatal lesions </plain></SENT>
