<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this treatment results in successful recanalization in less than 60% of treatable vessels (Multi MERCI trial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the use of a novel device, the Solitaire(TM) AB Neurovascular Remodeling Device (ev3 Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) that received the CE Mark for the treatment of neurovascular disease in 2007 and can recanalize arteries when MERCI has failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of mechanical thrombectomy in which a new device, Solitaire(TM) AB, was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the setting of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after unsuccessful recanalization with the MERCI(R) Retriever </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excellent angiographic and good clinical results were obtained without any complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Solitaire(TM) AB device was able to retrieve and remove clots efficiently from the middle cerebral artery when the MERCI system failed, thereby offering a new alternative in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
