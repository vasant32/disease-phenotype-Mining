<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a photothrombosis model in rabbits, 38 animals were divided into four groups, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose I and II, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> high-dose and vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose I (n=10) or II (n=7), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered for 23.5 or 22 h, respectively, starting 30 or 120 min after the start of photo-irradiation to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In high-dose (n=7), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered 30 min after the start of photo-irradiation for 23.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle treated group (control), 14 animals were infused continuously with saline for 23.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> at low and high doses <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged Activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (aPTT) by about 3 and 10 times compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was observed in one animal each of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose I and high-dose groups, and in three animals of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose II group, while no gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was observed in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose I, the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced and neurological deficits were significantly (P&lt;0.01) improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> high-dose, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size significantly increased, especially in the cortex (P&lt;0.0001), and neurological deficits were significantly (P&lt;0.01) worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> low-dose II, the size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using a photothrombotic model in the rabbit <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, we have investigated the antithrombotic benefits and hemorrhagic risks associated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of unique feature of our model is the fact that in a single animal model, we could evaluate doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> which reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and doses which can promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This model can be extended to determine both benefits and risks of antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
