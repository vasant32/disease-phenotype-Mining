<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about the role of ER stress in mediating pathophysiological reactions to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An attempt was therefore made to assess the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) induced ER stress and its modulation on outcome of ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h followed by varying time points of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain loci specific and time-dependent alterations were seen in the expression pattern of molecular markers, i.e., heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) for cytoplasmic dysfunction, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), and Processed X-box protein 1 (xbp1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for ER dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, histological examinations indicated pronounced brain damage, massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, and DNA fragmentation predominantly in the striatum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enhanced expression of GRP78, Caspase-12, CHOP/GADD153, ATF4 and processing of xbp1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the affected brain regions clearly indicate the critical involvement of ER-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/survival mechanisms and also collectively demonstrated the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation was used to counteract ER stress, which significantly increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2alpha), leading to reduced brain damage after I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inhibition of ER stress following I/R injury may be used as key therapeutic target for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
