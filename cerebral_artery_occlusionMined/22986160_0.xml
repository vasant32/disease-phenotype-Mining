<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a post hoc analysis of previously studied control rats we analyzed CBF time courses after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat in order to test whether intra-ischemic flow, reperfusion, and different parameters of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> flow transients (PIFTs) (amplitude, number) can predict outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (n=23) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (n=32) underwent 90-min filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative CBF changes were monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry at 4-5 mm lateral, and 1-2mm posterior to Bregma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional filament occlusion study (n=12) was performed to validate that PIFTs were coupled to direct current shifts of spreading depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PIFT-direct current shift study revealed that every PIFT was associated with a negative direct current shift typical of spreading depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-hoc analysis showed that the number of PIFTs, especially with the combination of intra-ischemic level of flow, can predict the development of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings show that PIFTs can serve as an early biomarker in predicting outcome in preclinical animal studies </plain></SENT>
