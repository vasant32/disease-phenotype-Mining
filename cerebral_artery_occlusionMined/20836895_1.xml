<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When screening natural compounds for drug candidates in this category, we isolated 6-O-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> shanzhiside <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (ND02), an iridoid <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> compound, from the leaves of Lamiophlomis rotata (Benth.) Kudo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of ND02 on a cultured neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y, in vitro, and on experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For TNF-α-stimulated SH-SY5Y cell line experiments in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with ND02 (20 μM or 40 μM) for 30 min and then incubated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vivo experiments, rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h followed by reperfusion for 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ND02 treatment of SH-SY5Y cell lines blocked TNF-α-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IκB-α phosphorylation and increased Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LY294002 blocked TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of Akt and reduced the phosphorylation of both IκB-α and NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At doses higher than 10 mg/kg, ND02 had a significant neuroprotective effect in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ND02 (25 mg/kg) demonstrated significant neuroprotective activity even after delayed administration 1 h, 3 h and 5 h after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ND02, 25 mg/kg, attenuated histopathological damage, decreased cerebral Evans blue extravasation, inhibited NF-κB activation, and enhanced Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that ND02 protects brain against I/R injury with a favorable therapeutic time-window by alleviating cerebral I/R injury and attenuating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown, and that these protective effects may be due to blocking of neuronal inflammatory cascades through an Akt-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
