<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparative proteome analysis was used to compare signal corresponding to individual cerebral cortex proteins on a two-dimensional gel between MCAO rats and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (NC) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After sample preparation, two-dimensional electroghoresis separated proteins were stained with Commassie Brilliant Blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The image data were analyzed on a Dell computer using Image Master v 3.01 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cerebral cortex, 30 proteins were differentially expressed in MCAO rats compared with NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 11 spots significantly increased, 15 spots significantly decreased and Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 was detected only in NC group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> reductase B, small inducible cytokine A4 [Precursor] only in MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peroxiredoxin 2 divided into two points in MCAO6h group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the end, this approach may lay a foundation for the further investigation of pathogenic mechanisms in cerebral ischmic injury </plain></SENT>
