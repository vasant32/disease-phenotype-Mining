<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In major cerebral arterial steno-occlusive diseases, there can be remarkably decreased hemodynamic reserve without marked neurological impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such settings, it is not known whether the neural activity is well maintained or disturbed according to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was therefore undertaken to examine the neural activity under mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> resulting from major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with minor neurological impairment as well as either unilateral internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of the cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was assessed by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change in neural activity in the ischemic brain was then evaluated by means of somatosensory evoked magnetic field with magnetoencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rCBF in the primary sensory area and the strength of the initial component of somatosensory evoked magnetic field (N20 m) were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01) and the second component (P30 m) was significantly augmented (P&lt;0.05) in the lesioned cerebral hemisphere as compared with the nonlesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The asymmetry indexes for N20 m were positively correlated (r=0.78) and those for P30 m were inversely correlated (r=-0.92) with asymmetry indexes for rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with either unilateral internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and minor neural impairments, there was a reduction of afferent signal and an augmentation of the secondary response of the neurons in the primary sensory area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This showed correlation with the severity of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
