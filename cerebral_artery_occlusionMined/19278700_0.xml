<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the serial metabolic changes of (1)H MRS in the cerebrum of ischemic dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in five health laboratory beagle dogs by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> plug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1)H MRS was serially performed three times with a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system: before, three days after and 10days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at both the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-asparate (p&lt;0.05), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> (mI), and a marked increase in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (Lac) level (p&lt;0.01) were found at three days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the levels of Lac significantly increased (p&lt;0.01); however, the other metabolites were partially elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of Cr, Cho and mI were not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05) when the before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> values were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant loss of NeuN and GFAP immunoreactivity at the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1)H MRS may be to a useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in dogs </plain></SENT>
