<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) have been linked to inflammatory reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have proved that oxymatrine (OMT) protected ischemic brain injury and this effect may be through the decreasing of NF-kappaB expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the mechanism of OMT in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the OMT's potential neuroprotective role and the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, saline and OMT treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model and administered OMT intraperitoneally immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and once daily on the following days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At time points after MCAO, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were used to analyse the expression of TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF-kappaB at gene and protein level in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The result indicated that OMT protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO; this effect may be through downregulation of the TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
