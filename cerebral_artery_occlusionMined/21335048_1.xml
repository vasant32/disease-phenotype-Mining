<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As of yet, pharmacological treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are only met with mediocre results, which are either ineffective or confounded by adverse effects, thus calling for a better understanding of endogenous neuroprotective mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have demonstrated that the translocated activation of conventional protein kinase Cγ (cPKCγ) is involved in the development of cerebral hypoxic preconditioning (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>), one of the most profound neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to substantiate the role of cPKCγ and its signaling molecules in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>-induced neuroprotection against subsequent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced permanent cerebral ischemic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> and cPKCγ on cerebral ischemic injuries were studied by observing the changes in neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cPKCγ membrane translocation (activation) and its interacting protein synapsin in the ischemic brain were examined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteomic approaches were employed to identify the cPKCγ-interacting proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> could markedly attenuate MCAO-induced brain injuries and the decrease of cPKCγ membrane translocation, but cPKCγ inhibitor Go6983 could block <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 41 identified cPKCγ-interacting proteins, 17 up- and 6 down-regulated proteins were observed in cytosol or particulate fraction during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the up-regulated synapsin could reciprocally co-precipitate with cPKCγ both in cytosol and particulate fractions, and Go6983 abolished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>-induced inhibition on synapsin dephosphorylation in ischemic core and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region (penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to report multiple cPKCγ-interacting proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> mouse brain and suggested that cPKCγ signaling molecules, especially the cPKCγ-synapsin pathway, might be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic injuries of mice </plain></SENT>
