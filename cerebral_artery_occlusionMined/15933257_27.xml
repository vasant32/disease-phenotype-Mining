<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study examined the long-term presence of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in the rat thalamus after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor outcome was assessed using a tapered/ledged beam-walking task after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of APP and Abeta was examined immunohistochemically at 1 week, 1 month, and 9 months after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCAO caused a long-lasting deficit in forelimb and hind limb function assessed using the beam-walking test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination revealed a transient increase in APP and Abeta staining in axons in the corpus callosum and in neurons at the border of the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APP and Abeta deposits persisted in the thalamic nuclei (ventroposterior lateral and ventroposterior medial nuclei), eventually leading to dense plaque-like deposits by the end of the 9-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deposits were surrounded by an astroglial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deposits were positive for Abeta and N-terminal APP, but not for C-terminal APP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against the C-terminal of Abeta, ie, Abeta42 and Abeta40, showed a preferential staining for Abeta42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> or thioflavine S did not stain the deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrated the persistent presence and aggregation of APP and Abeta, or their fragments, to dense plaque-like deposits in the ventroposterior lateral and ventroposterior medial nuclei of rats subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
