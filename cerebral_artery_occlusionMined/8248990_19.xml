<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used diffusion and perfusion MRI to evaluate the in vivo effects of a noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102, in a temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats underwent suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after occlusion, animals were randomly assigned to treatment with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102 (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6), receiving a bolus of 1.13 mg/kg at that time and an infusion of 0.785 mg.kg-1.h-1 for the next 165 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The placebo group received a saline bolus and infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion MRI studies by a spin-echo technique were initiated 30 minutes after occlusion and repeated every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI studies were obtained using echo-planar imaging after injection of superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> particles, immediately before and 15 minutes after withdrawal of the occluder at 3 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, the animals were clinically evaluated (scale of 0 to 5) and electively killed, and the brain was stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to evaluate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffusion imaging demonstrated markedly reduced ischemic lesion area in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102 group during occlusion--10.5 +/- 7.3% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of the ischemic hemisphere (optic chiasm slice) at 30 minutes after occlusion versus 50.0 +/- 2.7% of the hemisphere in controls (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With reperfusion after 3 hours of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, diffusion imaging documented an additional 29% reduction of the ischemic lesion area in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102-treated group (P &lt; .01) compared with the prereperfusion ischemic lesion area, with no change in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During occlusion, perfusion imaging demonstrated a relative signal intensity decline of 31.5 +/- 7.7% in controls and 83.4 +/- 7.6% in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102 group (P &lt; .005), indicating better perfusion in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After removal of the occluder, perfusion improved in both groups and was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Post mortem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 53.8 +/- 20.0 mm3 in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102 group and 216.8 +/- 16.1 mm3 in the controls (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome at 24 hours was 1.1 +/- 0.4 in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> 1102 group and 4.0 +/- 0.5 (scale of 0 to 5) in the controls (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
