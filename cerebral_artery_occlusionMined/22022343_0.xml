<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that oligogenesis and the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) vary in different brain regions using a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to Day 1, olig2(+) OPCs and oligodendrocytes (OLGs) increased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> basal ganglia (BG) 7 (44%) and 14 (61%) days after 2 hours of MCAO; OPCs (PDGFRÎ±(+)) and OLGs (CC1(+)) increased in this region 14 days after tMCAO by 139% and 126%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the olig2(+) cells and OLGs did not increase significantly in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>), the OPCs increased in this region by 95% at Day 14 vs. Day 1 after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of OPCs and OLGs remained low after an initial reduction at Day 1 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> corpus callosum (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses showed that the numbers of olig2(+) cells (r=0.73, P=0.03) and OLGs (r=0.74, P=0.02) correlated with local vessel density; however, the number of OPCs did not correlate with vessel density (r=0.43, P=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that oligogenesis and the maturation of OPCs differ in various brain regions and the difference in regional angiogenic response is one of the potential reasons </plain></SENT>
