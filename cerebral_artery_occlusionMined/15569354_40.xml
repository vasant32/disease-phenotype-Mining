<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The adult mammalian brain retains the capacity for neurogenesis, by which new neurons may be generated to replace those lost through physiological or pathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neurogenesis diminishes with aging, and this casts doubt on its feasibility as a therapeutic target for cell replacement therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, which disproportionately affect the aged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, neurogenesis was stimulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in young rodents, and the neurogenesis response of the aged rodent brain to physiological stimuli, such as hormonal manipulation and growth factors, was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of aging on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis, transient (60 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in young adult (3-month) and aged (24-month) rats, who were also given bromodeoxyuridine to label newborn cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As found in prior studies, basal neurogenesis in control, nonischemic rats was reduced with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> failed to stimulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) subgranular zone (SGZ), in contrast to results obtained previously after more prolonged (90-120 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but increased the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was less prominent in aged than in young adult rats, with fold-stimulation of BrdU incorporation reduced by approximately 20% and the total number of cells generated diminished by approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BrdU-labeled cells in SVZ coexpressed neuronal lineage markers, consistent with newborn neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis occurs in the aged brain, and that measures designed to augment this phenomenon might have therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
