<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been known for decades that suppression of spontaneous scalp electroencephalographic activity occurs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trend analysis for such suppression was found useful for intraoperative monitoring during carotid endarterectomy, or as a screening tool to detect delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> after aneurismal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, pathogenesis of such suppression of activity has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five patients with aneurismal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and four patients with decompressive hemicraniectomy after malignant hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we here performed simultaneously full-band direct and alternating current electroencephalography at the scalp and direct and alternating current electrocorticography at the cortical surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, 275 slow potential changes, identifying spreading depolarizations, were recorded electrocorticographically over 694 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual inspection of time-compressed scalp electroencephalography identified 193 (70.2%) slow potential changes [amplitude: -272 (-174, -375) ÂµV (median quartiles), duration: 5.4 (4.0, 7.1) min, electrocorticography-electroencephalography delay: 1.8 (0.8, 3.5) min] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intervals between successive spreading depolarizations were significantly shorter for depolarizations with electroencephalographically identified slow potential change [33.0 (27.0, 76.5) versus 53.0 (28.0, 130.5) min, P = 0.009] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography was thus more likely to display slow potential changes of clustered than isolated spreading depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to electrocorticography, no spread of electroencephalographic slow potential changes was seen, presumably due to superposition of volume-conducted electroencephalographic signals from widespread cortical generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two of five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, serial magnetic resonance imaging revealed large delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the recording site, while electrocorticography showed clusters of spreading depolarizations with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of spontaneous activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternating current electroencephalography similarly displayed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of spontaneous activity, and direct current electroencephalography slow potential changes riding on a shallow negative ultraslow potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Isolated spreading depolarizations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of both spontaneous electrocorticographic and electroencephalographic activity displayed significantly longer intervals between successive spreading depolarizations than isolated depolarizations with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of electrocorticographic activity [44.0 (28.0, 132.0) min, n = 96, versus 30.0 (26.5, 51.5) min, n = 109, P = 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests fusion of electroencephalographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> periods at high depolarization frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No propagation of electroencephalographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was seen between scalp electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Durations/magnitudes of isolated electroencephalographic and corresponding electrocorticographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> periods correlated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fewer spreading depolarizations were recorded in patients with malignant hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but characteristics were similar to those after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, spreading depolarizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> of spontaneous activity display correlates in time-compressed human scalp direct and alternating current electroencephalography that may serve for their non-invasive detection </plain></SENT>
