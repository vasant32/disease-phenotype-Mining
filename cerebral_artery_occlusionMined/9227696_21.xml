<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies demonstrated a significant neuroprotective action of the selective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-based bradykinin B2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CP-0597 after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the efficacy of this compound after reversible MCAO in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent reversible MCAO by insertion of a nylon monofilament to the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 hour the filament was retracted and the ischemic tissue reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after MCAO, primed miniosmotic pumps containing either vehicle or CP-0597 (300 ng/kg per minute) were implanted into the subcutaneous space (n = 14 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after surgery, animals were killed and brains fixed, and 4-micron sections were taken from five sequential tissue blocks labeled A through E and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation of rats was performed by neurological scoring and change in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with CP-0597 significantly reduced percent increase in hemisphere size of the ischemic hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain sections (C section: vehicle, 40.6 +/- 4.3% versus CP-0597, 20.8 +/- 5.3%; P &lt; 0.001), total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (vehicle, 206.5 +/- 7.7 mm3 versus CP-0597, 94.0 +/- 19.2 mm3; P &lt; .001), cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (vehicle, 145.5 +/- 4.5 mm3 versus CP-0597, 64.0 +/- 15.1 mm3; P &lt; .001), subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (vehicle, 55.8 +/- 4.1 mm3 versus CP-0597, 27.5 +/- 4.5 mm3; P &lt; .001), and the number of necrotic neurons (vehicle 42.9 +/- 3.8 versus CP-0597, 23.6 +/- 4.7 per field; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological score (vehicle, 2.78 +/- 0.36 versus CP-0597, 6.29 +/- 0.87 P &lt; .01) and change in body weight (vehicle, -28.7 +/- 2.0 g versus CP-0597, -18.2 +/- 2.8 g; P &lt; .01) were also significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate the significant overall efficacy profile of CP-0597 in a rat model of reversible MCAO and provide strong rationale for the use of such bradykinin B2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
