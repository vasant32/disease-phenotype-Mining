<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in preterm and term babies is common and results in significant morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vulnerability and pathophysiological mechanisms of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion may differ from those in the mature cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system because of the immaturity of many receptor systems and differences in metabolism in neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study details the neuropathological sequelae of reperfusion-induced brain injury after transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the postnatal day 7 (P7) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: P7 rats were subjected to 3 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by reperfusion or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed in a subset of animals before and 20 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining of the brain was performed 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry to identify astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), reactive microglia (ED-1), and neurons (microtubule-associated protein 2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining were done 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On contrast-enhanced MRI, nearly complete disruption of cerebral blood flow was evident in the vascular territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial restoration of blood flow occurred after removal of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, indicative of early cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, occurred in anatomic regions with a disrupted blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decline in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was associated with TTC- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-determined brain injury in these regions 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ischemic core was rapidly infiltrated with reactive microglia and was surrounded by reactive astroglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In P7 rats, transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and severe unilateral brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of a prominent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> suggests that both the ischemic episode and the reperfusion contribute to the neuropathological outcome </plain></SENT>
