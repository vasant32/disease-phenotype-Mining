<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among marine algae, Ecklonia cava, a member of the Laminariaceae, is a very popular food regarded as healthy in Korea and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, benefits afforded by phlorotannins in the treatment of various clinical conditions have been reported, but any therapeutic effects of such materials in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the mechanisms of action of the algal components remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present in vivo study, administration of Ecklonia cava <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> (ECP) at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in the rat after induction of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> via middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed dose-dependent blockage of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> upon intravenous ECP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral tests performed over the 6 days after MCAO revealed a reduction in neurological motor performance in control animals, but administration of ECP (50 mg/kg i.p.) prevented this decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, a significant neuroprotective effect of ECP was evident when cell viability was assayed after induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, upon <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> treatment, in the differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell line SH-SY5Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ECP blocked the rise in cytosolic calcium, in a dose-dependent manner, in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, the results suggest that ECP exerts neuroprotective effects in the focally ischemic brain by reducing Ca(2+)-mediated neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
