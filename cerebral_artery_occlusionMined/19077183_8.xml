<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effect of neurotrophic factors in enhancing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) is limited by their poor blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability.Intranasal administration is a noninvasive and valid method for delivery of neuropeptides into the brain, to bypass the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of treatment with intranasal transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on neurogenesis in the adult mouse SVZ following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The modified Neurological Severity Scores (NSS) test was used to evaluate neurological function, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) labeling was performed at 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and neuron- or glia-specific markers for identifying neurogenesis in the SVZ at 7, 14, 21, 28 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intranasal treatment of TGF-beta1 shows significant improvement in neurological function and reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 treated mice had significantly less TUNEL-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum than that in control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of BrdU-incorporated cells in the SVZ and striatum was significantly increased in the TGF-beta1 treated group compared with control animals at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, numbers of BrdU- labeled cells coexpressed with the migrating neuroblast marker doublecortin (DCX) and the mature neuronal marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN) were significantly increased after intranasal delivery of TGF-beta1, while only a few BrdU labeled cells co-stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intranasal administration of TGF-beta1 reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improves functional recovery and enhances neurogenesis in mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intranasal TGF-beta1 may have therapeutic potential for cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
