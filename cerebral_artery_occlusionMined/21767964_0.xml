<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We placed balloon-expandable coronary bare stents in 3 patients in whom revascularization was not obtained after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy (IV t-PA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient 1 was an 87-year-old woman with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (NIHSS) was 12, and her magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted image Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Programme Early Computed Tomography Score (MRI DWI-ASPECTS) was 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate revascularization was not obtained with IV t-PA and adjunctive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) for right M1 occlusion, and a stent was placed 368 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Trial (TIMI) score was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 90 days, her modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 was a 65-year-old woman with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her NIHSS score was 16, and MRI DWI-ASPECTS was 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A stent was placed 337 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after IV t-PA and adjunctive <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for right M1 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Her TIMI score was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 90 days, her mRS score was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 was a 61-year-old woman with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Her NIHSS score was 18, and MRI DWI-ASPECTS score was 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> was found after IV t-PA and adjunctive <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for the right M1 occlusion, so a stent was placed 312 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Her TIMI score was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After 90 days, her mRS score was 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization with emergency stent placement seems likely to be successful in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but clinical symptoms do not always improve in some cases and care is needed in selecting patients for the procedure </plain></SENT>
