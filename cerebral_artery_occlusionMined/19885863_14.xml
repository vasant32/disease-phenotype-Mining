<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the expression of neurotrophic factors in transplanted human MSCs and host brain tissue in rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 day after transient MCAO, 3 x 10(6) immortalized human MSC line (B10) cells or PBS was intravenously transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests, infarction volume, and B10 cell migration were investigated at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of endogenous (rat origin) and exogenous (human origin) neurotrophic factors and cytokines was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with PBS controls, rats receiving MSC transplantation showed improved functional recovery and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volume at 7 and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In MSC-transplanted brain, among many neurotrophic factors, only human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was detected in the core and ischemic border zone at 3 days after MCAO, whereas host cells expressed markedly higher neurotrophic factors (rat origin) than control rats, especially vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at 3 days and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) at 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenously transplanted human MSCs induced functional improvement, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and neuroprotection in ischemic rats, possibly by providing IGF-1 and inducing VEGF, EGF, and bFGF neurotrophic factors in host brain </plain></SENT>
