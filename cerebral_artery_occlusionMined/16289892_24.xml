<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated here the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> and riluzole, both activators of the 2P-domain K+ channel family TREK/TRAAK, in a model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> clinically relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, not only assessing neuronal protection, but also long term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the drug treatments were initiated post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1 h) and reperfusion according to the intraluminal filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drugs were injected into the jugular vein according to three protocols: (i) a single dose of 4 mg/kg riluzole or 500 nmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> at different reperfusion time; (ii) a three-day therapy (a single dose of 2 mg/kg riluzole and 250 nmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> given 1-2, 48 and 72 h after reperfusion); (iii) a three-week therapy (a single dose of 2 mg/kg riluzole and 250 nmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> given once a week during three weeks after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combined treatment with 2mg/kg riluzole+250 nmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> injected 2 h after reperfusion was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single dose of riluzole (4 mg/kg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> (500 nmol/kg) injected up to 3 h after reperfusion reduced drastically the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume by 75% and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were significantly improved by alpha-linolenic acid500 or riluzole4 with a neurological score of 1.8 as compared with 2.5 observed in vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">Alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi>- and riluzole treatment were associated with a reduction in cytopathological features of cell injury, including DNA fragmentation and Bax expression in the cortex and the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to the survival rate at 30 days, the best protections were obtained with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi>-injection in the three-week therapy as well as with a single dose of the combined treatment (2 mg/kg riluzole+250 nmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">Palmitic acid</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> that does not activate the 2P-domain K-channel TREK/TRAAK family, did not provide any neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that the TREK/TRAAK K-channel family may be a promising target for neuroprotection, and that riluzole and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> could be of therapeutic value against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury to the brain </plain></SENT>
