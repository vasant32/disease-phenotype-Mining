<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the specific function of SLK is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To gain further insights into the role of SLK we have characterized its activity, expression and distribution in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> during embryonic development and in the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although SLK is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues, our results show that it is expressed preferentially in neuronal lineages during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We find that SLK is preferentially expressed in the neurons and neuroepithelium of the developing embryo and can be detected at 10.5 and 12.5 days post-coitum (dpc) in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain of the developing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At later stages (14.5 dpc), SLK is expressed in the hypothalamus region, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the neural tube, dorsal root ganglion and in the proliferating ependymal layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, SLK expressing neuronal cells are lost and SLK is localized to phagocytic macrophages/microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a functional role for SLK in early neuronal development as well as in the adult <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
