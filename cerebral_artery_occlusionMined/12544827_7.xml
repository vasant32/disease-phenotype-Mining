<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We expected to find that sham grafted groups had impairments equivalent to those of MCAO-only controls, relative to intact controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This proved to be the case for contralateral and intraventricular grafts, and for asymmetry in rats with ipsilateral grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, spatial learning was substantially impaired and lesion volume was increased by 55% with ipsilateral dead cell grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> effects indicates potential hazards in the use of dead cells for sham grafts </plain></SENT>
