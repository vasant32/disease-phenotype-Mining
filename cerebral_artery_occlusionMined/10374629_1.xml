<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent 3.5-h of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was showed with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and quantitated by image analysis system, neurologic scores were determined with a 0-5 grading scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 3-Aminobenzamide (3-AB) 10 mg.kg-1 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (Nic) at 20 mg.kg-1 showed potent neuroprotective effects within 0-6 h, neurologic deficits were attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the increasing dose of PARP inhibitors, beneficial effects were compromised, particularly, administration of Nic 60 mg.kg-1 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion drastically accelerated brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phytomenadione, a selective inhibitor of mono (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>) transferase, had little effect on infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transient incomplete inhibition of PARP provides a neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury, with a relatively wide therapeutic window, whereas severe inhibition of this enzyme, especially in reperfusion phase, is detrimental </plain></SENT>
