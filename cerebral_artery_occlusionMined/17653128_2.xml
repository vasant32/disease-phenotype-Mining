<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study, on mice, was to compare the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> with those of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> plus disodium edetate (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also administered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA (0.005% (w/v) EDTA) to mice intravenously, and measured the changes in zinc concentrations occurring after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA displayed stronger neuroprotective effects than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we examined the neuroprotective effects of EDTA administered alone, and found that EDTA Na significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra was reduced more by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA than by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed in the in vitro study in five groups (aerobic, vehicle (control), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, EDTA, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> plus EDTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> and EDTA each protected PC12 cells against oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced cell damage, and the effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was increased by adding EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the chelating action of EDTA was a potential causal mechanism, we examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA on intracerebral zinc homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> EDTA was given intravenously 10 mins before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the zinc concentration decreased significantly in the cortical area, but not in the subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (a) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> provides neuroprotection against both in vivo and in vitro ischemic damage, and its effects are enhanced when EDTA is added; and (b) EDTA itself protects against ischemic neuronal damage, possibly, owing to its zinc-chelating action </plain></SENT>
