<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), A5, and TUNEL were also performed with brain sections after the tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo fluorescence was strongly observed at 48 hr over the head, especially with removal of both head skin and skull bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Zonal ex vivo fluorescent signals were surrounding the ischemic core, and double-positive cells with Cy5.5/exogenous A5 antibody were found in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSP70 was observed at the peak time of 24 hr; A5 became detectable at 12 hr, with increasing numbers until 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells increased at 24 hr and retained the high level until 4 days, showing a dissociating temporal pattern with A5 </plain></SENT>
