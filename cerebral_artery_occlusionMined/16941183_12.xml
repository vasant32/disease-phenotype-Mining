<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the correlation between initial cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI) volume (quantified on diffusion-weighted MRI) and the resulting clinical outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (M(1-2) segment) occlusion detected on MRI angiography treated by intravenous/intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (V(DWI-I) ) was retrospectively compared with neurological deficit evaluated using the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale on admission and 24 h later, and with the 90-day clinical outcome assessed using the modified Rankin scale in a series of 25 consecutive CI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit severity was assessed and, following the establishment of the maximum V(DWI-I) still associated with a good clinical outcome, the patients were divided into two groups (V(DWI-I) &lt; or =70 ml and &gt;70 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: V(DWI-I) ranged from 0.7 to 321 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 24-h clinical outcome improved significantly (P=0.0001) in 87% of patients with a V(DWI-I) &lt; or =70 ml (group 1) and deteriorated significantly (P=0.0018) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a V(DWI-I) &gt;70 ml (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 90-day mortality was 0% in group 1 and 71.5% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 90-day clinical outcome was significantly better in group 1 than in group 2 (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome could be predicted from initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume quantified by MRI-DWI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CI patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion treated by intravenous/intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a V(DWI-I) &lt; or =70 ml had a significantly better outcome </plain></SENT>
