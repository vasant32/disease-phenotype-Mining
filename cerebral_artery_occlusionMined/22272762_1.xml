<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested recently that PDGF receptor β (PDGFRβ) expressed in brain pericytes as well as in neurons and astrocytes may mediate the neuroprotective role of PDGF-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to elucidate the roles of PDGFRβ signaling in brain pericytes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model, PDGFRβ expression was induced specifically in the pericytes in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and its level was gradually increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PDGF-B induced marked phosphorylation of Akt in cultured brain pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, PDGF-B was upregulated in endothelial cells in per-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and Akt was strongly phosphorylated in the PDGFRβ-expressing pericytes in periinfarct areas after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cultured pericytes, PDGF-B induced cell growth and anti-apoptotic responses through Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PDGF-B significantly increased the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) through Akt in the pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the PDGFRβ-Akt signaling in brain pericytes may play various important roles leading to neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
