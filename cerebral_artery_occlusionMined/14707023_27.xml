<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ideal therapeutic approach to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> might have both aspects of enhancement of collateral formation and prevention of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that also acts as a neurotrophic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this study, we examined the therapeutic effects of HGF on brain injury in a rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene transfer into the brain was performed by injection of human HGF gene with hemagglutinating virus of Japan-envelope vector into the cerebrospinal fluid via the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the HGF gene resulted in a significant decrease in the infarcted brain area as assessed by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, whereas rats transfected with control vector exhibited a wide area of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the decrease in neurological deficit was significantly attenuated in rats transfected with the HGF gene at 24 hours after the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was also detected in rats transfected with the HGF gene compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of importance, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> or destruction of the blood-brain barrier was observed in rats transfected with the HGF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study demonstrated that overexpression of the HGF gene attenuated brain ischemic injury in a rat model, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, through angiogenic and neuroprotective actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the reduction of brain injury by HGF may provide a new therapeutic option to treat cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
