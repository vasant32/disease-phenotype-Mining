<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups of six rats each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A rats received no medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other three groups received 0.1 mg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>/kg/2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group B rats received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group C and D rats received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and autologous arterial blood by transvenous perfusion of the brain, Group C rats at 100 mm Hg perfusion pressure and Group D rats at 150 mm Hg perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> started 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and lasted for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three hours after occlusion, we used double- or single-tracer autoradiography with 4-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]fluoroantipyrine or [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine and [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> as tracers to study the brains for local cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier permeability changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group C showed a significant increase of local cerebral blood flow in the parietal cortex (89%, p less than 0.01) and sensorimotor cortex (64%, p less than 0.05) compared with Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group D showed an extensive and striking increase in local cerebral blood flow of the ischemic cortical and subcortical areas (57-100%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group B showed no significant changes but exhibited further reduction of local cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cerebral hemisphere associated with slightly increased local cerebral blood flow in the nonischemic cerebral hemisphere compared with Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no change of blood-brain barrier permeability in any group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
