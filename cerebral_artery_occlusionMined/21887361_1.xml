<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>Memory impairment</z:hpo> is a frequent complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis is implicated in learning and memory and is regulated by the transcription factor c-Fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (IH) attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo>, but it is not known whether post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> IH intervention has a similar effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> IH on hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression as well as spatial learning and memory in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in some rats by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), while other rats received sham MCAO surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beginning a week later, half of the rats of each group received IH interventions (12% oxygen concentration, 4 hrs/d, for 7 d) and half received sham IH sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional group of rats received MCAO, IH, and injections of the neurogenesis-impairing agent 3'-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="10110">AZT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spatial learning and memory was measured in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, and hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (pMAPK) were considered as possible mediators of IH-induced changes in neurogenesis and c-Fos expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IH intervention following MCAO resulted in recovered spatial memory, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and increased expression of c-Fos in newborn hippocampal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects were blocked by 3'-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="10110">AZT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IH intervention following MCAO also was associated with increased hippocampal pMAPK and HIF-1α expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: IH intervention following MCAO rescued <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced spatial learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo>, likely by inducing hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression through mediators including pMAPK and HIF-1α </plain></SENT>
