<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of HSP90 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> remain constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, HSP70 and HSP90 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are both raised, particularly in the CA1 neurons in the hippocampus, an area that is resistant to the insult in comparison to the surrounding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HSP27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is raised in the neuroglia in the subregions of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the protein levels of HSP27, 70 and 90 have not been characterised in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this data in mind, we have carried out a comparative study of HSP27, 56, 60, 70 and 90 mRNA and protein levels during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in rats, up to 24 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have shown that HSP70 and HSP27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are increased and also that HSP60 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (which had also not previously been characterised in this model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>) are significantly raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HSP90 and HSP56 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were not significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On Western blot analysis, the inducible HSP72 protein was first detected at 8 h post-occlusion, HSP27 protein was detected only at 24 h post-occlusion and HSP60 protein, although constitutive, appeared to increase at 24 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HSP56 protein levels appeared to rise on the occluded side, but HSP90 protein levels remained constant </plain></SENT>
