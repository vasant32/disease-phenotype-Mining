<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluated effects on spleen and blood cells 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was a less inflammatory cytokine profile in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-affected right brain hemisphere at 96 h compared with earlier time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0003643'>splenic atrophy</z:mp> characterized by a reduction in organ size, a drastic loss of splenocyte numbers, and induction of annexin V+ and TUNEL+ cells within the spleen that are in the late stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequence of this process was to reduce T cell proliferation responses and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a state of profound immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes produced a drastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010976'>reduction in B cell numbers</z:hpo> in spleen and blood, and a novel increase in CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we detected a striking increase in the percentage of nonapoptotic CD11b+ VLA-4-negative macrophages/monocytes in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression in response to brain injury may account for the reduction of inflammatory factors in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-affected brain, but also potentially could curtail protective immune responses in the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new evidence to support the contention that damage to the brain caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> provides a powerful negative signal to the peripheral immune system that ultimately induces a drastic state of immunosuppression caused by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as an increased presence of CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
