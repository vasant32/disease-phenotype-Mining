<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NCKX2 is the major neuronally expressed isoform among NCKX members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its importance in maintaining <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, and K+ homeostasis in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, the role of NCKX2 during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, a condition characterized by an alteration of ionic concentrations, has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examines NCKX2 role in the development of ischemic brain damage in permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of nckx2 ablation on neuronal survival, nckx2-/- primary cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation plus reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NCKX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression was evaluated in the ischemic core and surrounding ipsilesional areas, at different time points after pMCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ischemic core and in periinfarctual area, NCKX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, NCKX2 knock-down by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and NCKX2 knock-out by genetic disruption dramatically increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, nckx2-/- primary cortical neurons displayed a higher vulnerability and a greater [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i increase under hypoxic conditions, compared with nckx2+/+ neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, NCKX currents both in the forward and reverse mode of operation were significantly reduced in nckx2-/- neurons compared with nckx2+/+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results indicate that NCKX2 is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and it may represent a new potential target to be investigated in the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
