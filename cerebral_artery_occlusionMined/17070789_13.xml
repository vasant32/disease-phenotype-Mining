<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated effects of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cells on sensorimotor, cognitive, and histological outcome in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi> anesthetized adult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient MCAO for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HUCB cells (mononuclear 1-5x10(7) or Lin(-) cells 1-5x10(5)) were administered intravenously after 24 h recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The limb-placing test was performed on postoperative days 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, beam-walking and cylinder tests were used to assess sensorimotor function at baseline, and on postoperative days 4, 12, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> was used to assess cognitive performance on postoperative days 22-24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, rats were perfused for measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and detection of HUCB cells by immunohistochemistry (MAB1281) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCAO rats showed a partial spontaneous recovery in sensorimotor function during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the recovery profile was similar in MCAO controls and in MCAO rats that received HUCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HUCB did not affect impaired water-maze performance of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only few human nuclei-specific MAB1281-positive cells were detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere in MCAO rats that received HUCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes did not differ between the experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A group of additional rats were used to further study biodistribution of intravenously given (111)In-oxine-labelled mononuclear HUCB cells in MCAO and sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SPECT imaging data indicated a high tracer uptake in the lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, but not in the brain immediately after administration or 24 h post-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that HUCB cells do not improve functional recovery or histological outcome in MCAO rats after systemic administration because of limited migration of cells in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
