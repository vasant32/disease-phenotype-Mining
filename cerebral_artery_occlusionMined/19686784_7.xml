<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined a number of short and long-term sensorimotor, behavioural and cognitive consequences of an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by a 60-min right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in 129S2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During 14 days after surgery, a classical sensorimotor assessment was conducted using hanging wire test, negative geotaxis test, grip strength test, accelerated rotarod test and locomotor activity-meter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to provide a technique for the assessment of more resistant consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on fine psychomotor control, the peak procedure (a modified version of the operant fixed-interval schedule of reinforcement) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure also helped to objectify temporal perception in mice five weeks following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On several sensorimotor tests, ischemic mice showed some degree of impairment which rapidly tended to improve after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a profile of results substantially consistent with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five weeks post-surgery, ischemic mice tested with the peak procedure exhibited a moderate but yet significant temporal regulation impairment along with a reduced response rate compared to control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the peak procedure and other derived operant schedules of reinforcement may provide useful and sensitive tools for the long-term assessment of both behavioural and cognitive aspects of the consequences of an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
