<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The border of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is sharply demarcated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found in our investigation, however, that this is merely a macroscopic diagnosis and does not say anything about the structure of the tissue and the content of morphologically preserved neurons in the marginal zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In six cats the left cerebral artery was permanently occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks later the animals were killed and autoradiographic investigations were conducted on cryostat sections to determine rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjacent to every 20-microns section, a 10-microns HE section was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preserved nerve cells were counted in several areas of the cortex in a symmetric fashion in both the infarcted and the contralateral side in the identical regions where rCBF had been measured in the preceding section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two additional non-ischemic cat brains served as controls, which were investigated in the same manner as described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A marked loss of neurons was observed in the border zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only occasionally preserved ganglion cells were seen in each cortical layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even in areas one gyrus distant to the margin of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> the number of neurons was still reduced by one third as compared to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Starting only with the lateral gyrus the number of ganglionic cells was found to be equal on both sides </plain></SENT>
