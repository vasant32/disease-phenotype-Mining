<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 18) were treated with either intravenous saline (control), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK801 (1 mg/kg), or CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716A (1 mg/kg) 30 min after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MK801 significantly attenuated the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the infarcted striatum (79 +/- 22 micromol/L) as compared with controls (322 +/- 104 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The administration of CB1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716A had no statistically significant effect on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release (340 +/- 89 micromol/L), but reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 5 h after MCAO significantly by approximately 40%, whereas MK801 treatment resulted in a non-significant (18%) reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In controls, striatal and cortical NAE concentrations were about 30-fold higher in the infarcted than in the non-infarcted hemisphere, whereas ipsilateral N-acyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (N-acyl PE) levels exceeded contralateral levels by only a factor of two to three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MK801 or SR141716A, or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in the infarcted tissue, had no significant effect on these levels </plain></SENT>
