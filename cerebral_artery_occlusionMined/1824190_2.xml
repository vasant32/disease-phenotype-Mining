<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of a new cerebral activator, indeloxazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, on behavioral, electroencephalographic and biochemical changes were investigated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase in rats subjected to left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disturbance of the one-trial passive avoidance task and neurological deficits were present for 14 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, while no significant changes in spontaneous motor activity and electroencephalogram in the cerebral cortex were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in the content of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in the frontal cortex, of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxy-phenylethylglycol in the hippocampus, and of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxy-phenylethylglycol in the corpus striatum on the occluded side were observed on day 14 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of the test drug was started from day 7 after surgery and was repeated once a day for 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeloxazine (10 or 20 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the latency of step-through in the passive avoidance test and desynchronized the spontaneous electroencephalogram without affecting neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeloxazine (10 or 30 mg/kg) caused significant increases in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and decreases of 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid in the bilateral frontal cortex and hippocampus and contralateral corpus striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeloxazine (30 mg/kg) increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in the contralateral frontal cortex and bilateral hippocampus and decreased 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxy-phenylethylglycol in the contralateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we found that indeloxazine ameliorated cerebral function in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the present results, it is suggested that the pharmacological action of indeloxazine may be attributable to its enhancing action on central monoaminergic systems </plain></SENT>
