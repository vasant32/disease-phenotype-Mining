<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, two DINE-Akt-transgenic mouse lines displayed reductions of the infarcted area by 35% compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR assays showed a high level of transgene in response to ischemic brain damage in these lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the DINE promoter is a useful promoter, which responds to neuronal insults and that the Akt-induced neuroprotective effect against ischemic damage is potent in vivo </plain></SENT>
