<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parvalbumin protects neuron from cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through reduction of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated parvalbumin expression after neuronal cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> (MCAO) were surgically performed in a rat model to induce focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were used and brain tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damages and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A proteomic approach revealed a decrease of parvalbumin expression in MCAO-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that MCAO induces a reduction in parvalbumin transcript and protein levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of parvalbumin-positive cells were also decreased in the cerebral cortices of MCAO-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> exposure significantly increased intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations and induced a reduction of parvalbumin expression in a hippocampal-derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the reduction in parvalbumin levels after ischemic brain injury can modulate neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
