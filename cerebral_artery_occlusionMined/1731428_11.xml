<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason we evaluated the effects of the platelet activating factor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> apafant (4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2[3(4-morpholinyl)-3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28831">propanol-1</z:chebi>- yl[6H-thieno[3.2-f[[1.2.4]triazolo]4,3-1]]1.4]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47918">diazepine</z:chebi> on farct volume and local cerebral blood flow following irreversible occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in rats to assess the direct and vascular components of apafant's action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 48 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of multiple doses of apafant (30 mg/kg p.o.) was tested in both pretreatment (n = 8) and posttreatment (n = 8) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the pretreatment group apafant was given 30 minutes before and 2, 6, and 18 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats of the posttreatment group received apafant 1, 6, and 18 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effect of a single dose of apafant given 30 minutes prior to occlusion (n = 9) on local cerebral blood flow determined 2 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both regimens of apafant effectively decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 59% (p less than 0.01; H test, U test) when the rats were treated before and after vessel occlusion whereas the decrease was 47% (p less than 0.05; H test, U test) when treatment began 1 hour after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apafant did not change local cerebral blood flow after occlusion compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the cytoprotection afforded by apafant occurs mainly via a direct effect on brain tissue and has no major vascular component </plain></SENT>
