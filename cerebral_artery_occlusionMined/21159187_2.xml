<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent literature showed that mouse monocytes exhibit two distinct populations that represent pro-inflammatory (Ly-6Chi/CCR2+) and anti-inflammatory (Ly-6Clow/CCR2-) subsets and that spleen is a major source for monocyte deployment upon injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By reducing post-ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with antibacterial moxifloxacin (MFX) treatment, the present study investigates the effect of the treatment on Ly-6C and CCR2 expression in the spleen following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the extent to which the effect is associated with attenuation of post-ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice subjected to a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) showed a significant reduction in their spleen weights compared to sham animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to vehicle controls, splenocytes obtained from daily MFX-treated mice 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exhibited significantly reduced mean Ly-6C expression within pro-inflammatory subsets, whereas the distribution of pro- and anti-inflammatory subsets was not different between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, MFX treatment significantly reduced CCR2 expression in the spleen tissue and in the post-ischemic brain and attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study suggests a potential contributing role of spleen monocytes in post-ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and injury </plain></SENT>
