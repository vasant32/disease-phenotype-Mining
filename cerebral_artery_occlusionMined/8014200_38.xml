<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted to determine whether a potent, reversible calpain inhibitor could reduce the cortical ischemic brain damage associated with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AK275 (Z-Leu-Abu-CONH-CH2CH3), the active isomer of the diastereomeric mixture, CX275, was employed in conjunction with a novel method of perfusing drug directly onto the infarcted cortical surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This protocol reduced or eliminated numerous, nonspecific pharmacokinetic, hemodynamic, and other potentially confounding variables that might complicate interpretation of any drug effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced using a variation of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated a reliable and robust neuroprotective effect of AK275 over the concentration range of 10 to 200 microM (perfused supracortically at 4 microliters/h for 21 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a 75% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed when initiation of drug treatment was delayed for 3 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data further support an important role of calpain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuropathology and suggest that calpain inhibitors may provide a unique and potentially powerful means of treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other ischemic brain incidents </plain></SENT>
