<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, protects against ischemic brain damage induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in vitro and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> happens frequently in aged individuals, we herein sought to further define the protective effects of Rd in the aged mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>16-18-month-old mice administered with Rd (0.1-200 mg/kg) or vehicle were subjected to transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rd at the doses of 10-50 mg/kg significantly reduced both cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This protection was associated with an improvement in neurological function and was sustained for at least 2 weeks after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Rd was effective even when administered up to 4 h after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the underlying mechanisms, oxidative DNA damage was identified by 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine immunostaining, oxidative protein damage was identified by the assessment of protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was estimated by determining the malondialdehyde formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rd significantly suppressed the accumulations of DNA, protein and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products at 24 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rd also protected mitochondria at 4 and 24 h after reperfusion as indicated by preserved respiratory chain complex activities and aconitase activity, lowered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> production, and hyperpolarized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Rd partly enhanced endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Rd exerts neuroprotection against transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the aged brain, which may be associated with the attenuation of redox imbalance </plain></SENT>
