<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique to guide brain tissue sampling in experimental focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique allows visual identification for accurate metabolic analysis of regions with variable tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2.5 hours of unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat, intravenous infusion of the vital dye, neutral red (NR), identified three distinct regions: (a) an intensely stained region consisting of the entire contralateral hemisphere and the medial ipsilateral hemisphere; (b) a blanched region in the lateral ipsilateral hemisphere; and (c) a zone of intermediately stained tissue interposed between the medial and lateral ipsilateral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Close regional correlation between NR staining and the iodoantipyrine intensity of adjacent brain slices suggests that NR distribution is a qualitative indicator of brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the NR staining pattern to guide tissue dissection for metabolite analysis of high energy phosphates (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-related metabolites showed that the blanched region contained ischemic tissue, whereas values from the contralateral cortex resembled those of control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intermediately stained region exhibited a gradient of metabolic perturbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue near intensely stained regions resembled control tissue, and tissue near blanched regions resembled ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the concept of a metabolic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When present, it occupies only the most medial area of the intermediate region at 2.5 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
