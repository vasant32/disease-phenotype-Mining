<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated the beneficial effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored whether transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) modified by GDNF gene provides a better therapeutic effect than native NSCs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary rat NSCs were transfected with GDNF plasmid (GDNF/NSCs, labeled by green fluorescent protein from AdEasy-1, GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were subjected to two-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion, followed by infusion of NSCs (labeled with5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine before infusion, BrdU), GDNF/NSCs and saline at 3 days after reperfusion (NSCs group, GDNF/NSCs group, control group), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 weeks after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) test and H and E staining were respectively performed to evaluate neurological function and lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify implanted cells and observe the expressions of Synaptophysin (Syp) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was employed to observe apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was used to detect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-3 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery of mNSS was found in GDNF/NSCs rats at 2 and 3 weeks after reperfusion compared with NSCs rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume in the NSCs and GDNF/NSCs groups was reduced significantly compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of NSCs in the GDNF/NSCs group was significantly increased in comparison with NSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Syp-immunoreactive product at 2 and 3 weeks after reperfusion and PSD-95 immunoreactive product in the GDNF/NSCs group were significantly increased compared with NSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, caspase-3 positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells in the GDNF/NSCs group were significantly decreased compared with NSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant increase of BDNF protein in the GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups was observed compared to the control group at different time points of reperfusion, and GDNF/NSCs grafting significantly increased BDNF protein expression compared to NSCs grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, significant increase of NT-3 protein in GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups was detected only at 1 week of reperfusion compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that grafting NSCs modified by GDNF gene provides better neuroprotection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than NSCs grafting alone </plain></SENT>
