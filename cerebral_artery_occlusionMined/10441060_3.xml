<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The powerful vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 (ET1) has been shown to reduce local cerebral blood flow in brain areas supplied by the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) to a pathologically low level upon intracerebral injection adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reduction manifests itself as an ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, that is fully developed within 3 days after ET1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of ET1 on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ET1 was microinjected unilaterally at a dose of 60 pmol in 3 microl of saline to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG signals were recorded from the frontoparietal cortical area, supplied by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, from the first up to the fourteenth day after ET1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG activity was analyzed by the fast Fourier transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant shift to a lower EEG frequency, i.e., augmentation of slow waves and a reduction of alpha-like and faster EEG waves was found post-ET1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was maximal after 3-7 days when the most severe destruction of neurons in this cortical area occurs, as has been previously demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the quantitative EEG analysis may provide useful additional information about the functional disturbances associated with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
