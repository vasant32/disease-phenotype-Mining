<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abnormal expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory processes that accompany most central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, early upregulation of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 has been shown to contribute to disruption of the blood-brain barrier and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neurons in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ zymography reveals a significant increase in gelatinolytic MMPs activity in the ischemic brain hemisphere after 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by 2-h reperfusion in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, gel zymography demonstrates that expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are enhanced in cortex and striatum ipsilateral to the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter effect appears to be instrumental for development of delayed brain damage since administration of a broad spectrum, highly specific MMPs inhibitor, GM6001, but not by its negative control, results in a significant (50%) reduction in ischemic brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased gelatinase activity in the ischemic cortex coincides with elevation (166% vs sham) of mature interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) after 2-h reperfusion and this does not appear to implicate a caspase-1-dependent processing of pro(31kDa)-IL-1beta to yield mature (17kDa) IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, when administered at a neuroprotective dose GM6001 abolishes the early IL-1beta increase in the ischemic cortex and reduces the cleavage of the cytokine proform supporting the deduction that MMPs may initiate IL-1beta processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, development of tissue damage that follows <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> implicates a crucial interplay between MMPs and mediators of neuroinflammation (e.g., IL-1beta), and this further underscores the therapeutic potential of MMPs inhibitors in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
