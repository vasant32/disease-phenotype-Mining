<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> is an atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotic drug</z:chebi> that may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present work examined whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> enhances the vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats and the potential mechanisms underlying such action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiment 1: Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone SHRs (SHR-SPs) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> (0.8 and 2.4 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 30 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage in response to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was measured microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, the levels of malondialdehyde were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2: Survival data were recorded in SHR-SPs that received daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> perpetually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiment 3: Effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> on interleukin-6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± was examined in quiescent or LPS-activated cortical microglias from WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiment 4: Potential damage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> exposure to neurons was examined in primary neuronal culture obtained from WKY rats, SHRs, and SHR-SPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas upon MCAO in SHR-SPs and SHRs, but not in WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival time in SHR-SPs was shortened by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was augmented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> through enhanced Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> also increased endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> enhances the vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats through increasing neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
