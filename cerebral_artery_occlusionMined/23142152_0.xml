<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The period from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> initiation to the cessation of penumbra damage spread represents a therapeutic window when expansion can be alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we studied some biochemical parameters helpful for the estimation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression and thus for the application of interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed four groups: the control group and three groups of animals after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion periods of 2h, 1day or 3days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischaemic core and penumbra, fluorimetric and spectrophotometric methods for investigating total MnSOD and MAO-A/B activity as well as level of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein synthesis was assessed by in vitro measurements of (14)C-leucine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Noticeable differences between core and penumbra biochemical parameters were shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the core, protein synthesis was transiently inhibited two hours and three days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> and total SOD activity peaked on the first day, but on the third day after MCAO, rapidly decreased by about 44% and 33.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> led to higher protein synthesis (78%), elevations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and rapid activation of MnSOD (by about 884%) one day after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the third day, protein synthesis and MnSOD were still significantly elevated (36% and 388%, respectively), while <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels returned to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> on MAO-A/B activity in the penumbra was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, biochemical parameter screening could be helpful to assess cell damage progress and the possibility of rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These regions reflect different biochemical patterns that seem to be clearly established on the first day after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the first day of post-ischaemic reperfusion in the present model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seems to be the breakpoint, i.e. the time at which expanding cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core to the penumbra can be at least partially eliminated </plain></SENT>
