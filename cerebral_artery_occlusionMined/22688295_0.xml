<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> following ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attracts high priority in current research, particularly using human-like models and long-term observation periods considering translational aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed on the spatio-temporal course of macrophage-like cell accumulation after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> and addressed microglial and astroglial reactions in the ischaemic border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, effects of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as currently best treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the potentially neuroprotective co-administration of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were assigned to control, tPA or tPA+HBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours, 7, 14 and 28 days were determined as observation time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of macrophage-like cells was semiquantitatively assessed by CD68 staining in the ischaemic area and ischaemic border zone, and linked to the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD11b, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) were applied to reveal delayed glial and neuronal alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, the accumulation of macrophage-like cells increased distinctly from 24 hours to 7 days post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>tPA+HBO tended to decrease macrophage-like cell accumulation at day 14 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, a trend towards an association of increased accumulation and pronounced reduction of the neurological deficit was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concerning delayed inflammatory reactions, an activation of microglia and astrocytes with co-occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was observed on day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thereby, <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> was found circularly in contrast to microglial activation directly in the ischaemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study supports previous data on long-lasting inflammatory processes following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and additionally provides region-specific details on glial reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The tendency towards a decreasing macrophage-like cell accumulation after tPA+HBO needs to be discussed critically since neuroprotective properties were recently ascribed to long-term inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
