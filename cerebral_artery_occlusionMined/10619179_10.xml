<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracerebroventricular application of 0.1 or 1.0 nmol somatostatin-14 5 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size assessed 7 days after the insult (by 47% and 57% of the saline control), whereas 10.0 nmol had no significant protective effect (9% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar dose/response relationship was obtained after intracerebroventricular injection of octreotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lower doses of 0.1 or 1.0 nmol afforded significant neuroprotection (reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 72 and 57%), whereas 10 nmol actually increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size up to 348% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortistatin-14 (10 nmol) decreased the ischaemic damage by 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison with the neuropeptides acting on somatostatin receptors, the kappa opiate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> enadoline (10 nmol) also had a significant protective effect against the development of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>; the extent of the brain damage was reduced by 60% after intracerebroventricular injection </plain></SENT>
