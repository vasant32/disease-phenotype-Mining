<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the effects of two kinds of PKC inhibitors, H-7 and matrine, were examined on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation in experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that pretreatment with H-7 6.25 and 12.5 mg.kg-1 prevented the accumulation of water and certain electrolytes in the unilateral hemisphere of the brain evoked by ligation of a single common carotid artery in Mongolian gerbil; pretreatment with matrine 25 and 50 mg.kg-1 reduced the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation evoked by ligation of a single common carotid artery in gerbil and by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results present new evidence for the involvement of PKC in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
