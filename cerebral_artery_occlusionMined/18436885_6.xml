<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Filamentous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (fMCAO) is the most frequently used focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proximity of the ophthalmic artery to the middle cerebral artery suggests that fMCAO induces <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore tested whether fMCAO induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion damage in retina in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SV129EV mice were subjected to transient (30 or 60 minutes) fMCAO followed by reperfusion under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> perfusion was evaluated by intravenous injection of fluorescent microspheres combined with fluorescent microscopy using flat-mounted retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent density of ipsilateral retina relative to contralateral retina was determined in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> injury was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining and in situ TUNEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microsphere analysis demonstrated perfusion defect in the ipsilateral retina after 60 minutes fMCAO and effective restoration after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes fMCAO did not produce evident histological changes, even after 2 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty minutes fMCAO followed by 2 hours reperfusion resulted in extensive cell damage in the inner nuclear (&gt;30%) and ganglion cell (&gt;50%) layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TUNEL demonstrated very few positive cells, suggesting that damaged cells were mainly undergoing nonapoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sixty minutes fMCAO produces <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> injury in SV129EV mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> should be considered when a particular occlusion period is selected for studying neurological outcomes after fMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because visual disturbance is often associated with thrombotic/embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans, fMCAO represents an appropriate model for future studies aimed at understanding and ameliorating the changes that lead to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage in these patients </plain></SENT>
