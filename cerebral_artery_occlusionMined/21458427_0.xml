<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the effect of cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on cerebral blood flow (CBF), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and clinical outcome in a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation of the right and left vagus nerves was initiated 30min after the induction of the right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and lasted for 1h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size measurement revealed that the volume of ischemic damage was 41-45% smaller in animals receiving stimulation as compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the right and left VNS caused subtle reduction in CBF during each 30-s stimulation period that quickly returned back to the baseline level at the end of each stimulation cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect of VNS on CBF during the entire 1-h stimulation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of VNS on tissue outcome was associated with better neurological outcome at both 1- and 3-day time points after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that VNS-induced protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic brain injury is not primarily mediated by changes in CBF, stimulation of both the right and left nerve have comparable effects, and VNS is effective after ipsilateral and contralateral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
