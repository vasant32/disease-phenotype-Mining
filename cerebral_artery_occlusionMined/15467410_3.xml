<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients, each with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI, Moya-moya, a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, post-trauma syndrome, and a metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp>, were selected for a presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A susceptibility-contrast echo-planar image after a routine MRI was taken as the source image with a rapid manual injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inflow and washout patterns were observed from the time-signal intensity curve of the serial scans using the standard program of an MRI machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The repeated Z-score images of the peak and late phases were made using the threshold Z-score values between 1.4 and 2.0 in four to five studies of the pre-contrast, peak, and late phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic subtraction images were produced by subtracting sequential post-contrast images from a pre-contrast image and coloring these images using a pseudocolor mapping method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the diseases with perfusion abnormalities, the Z-score images revealed information about the degree of perfusion during the peak and late phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the quality varied with the Z-score threshold and the studies selected in a group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dynamic subtraction images were of sufficient quality with no background noise and more clearly illustrated the temporal changes in perfusion and delayed perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Z-scores and dynamic subtraction images illustrated the degree of perfusion and sequential changes in the pattern of perfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These images can be used as a new complimentary method for observing the perfusion patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
