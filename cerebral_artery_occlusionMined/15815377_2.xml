<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure was increased by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increase was maintained for 3 h, at which time the brains were harvested and sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific gravity (SG) was determined in specimens of cortex and subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain sections adjacent to those used for SG measurement were incubated in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation in both groupsipsilateral to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in some regions, there was less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> accumulation in the induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group than in normotensive control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adjacent regions, the area of reduced or absent TTC staining was also significantly less in the induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that, in this model, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> established soon after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can serve to reduce the area of histochemically detectable neuronal dysfunction, and that not only is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation not aggravated, but it is actually reduced </plain></SENT>
