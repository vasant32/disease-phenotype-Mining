<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether albumin might also be neuroprotective in ischemic brain injury using a transient filament middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tfMCAO) model in 10-d-old rat pups treated with 0.25% albumin or saline 1 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed serial neurobehavioral and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments immediately after tfMCAO (day 0) and on 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG staining to assess blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity and standard histology was obtained on 1, 3, and 28 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes from MRI were similar in saline and albumin groups (0 h: 39% and 44%; d 1: 46% and 55%; and d 28:10% and 24%) as were neurobehavioral assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG staining at 3 d post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed loss of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity that was significantly reduced after albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated T2 values suggesting vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was seen in albumin compared with saline-treated animals, as was increased water mobility (i.e. increased apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) reflecting cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reasons why albumin was not neuroprotective in neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with adults remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effective strategies in adult models need to be reassessed in the neonate </plain></SENT>
