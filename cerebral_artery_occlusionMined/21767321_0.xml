<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Liver X receptors (LXR) have previously been shown to stabilize the integrity of atherosclerotic noncerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their effects on ischemic cerebral vessels are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By delivering LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, T0901317 and GW3965, to mice submitted to 30 minutes intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we show that LXR activation reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and decreases <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability by upregulating LXR's target calpastatin that deactivates calpain-1/2, stabilizing p120 catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p120 catenin specifically interacts with RhoA and Cdc42, inactivating the former and overactivating the latter, thus restoring the postischemic expression, phosphorylation and interaction of the tight junction proteins occludin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> occludens-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LXR activation deactivates matrix metalloproteases-2/9 and inhibits microvascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by deactivating JNK1/2 and caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, which have previously been shown to be upregulated by LXR in noncerebral vessels, LXR activation increases the abundance of the drug transporters ABCB1 and ABCC1 on ischemic brain capillaries, as we further show </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That LXR activation promotes endothelial integrity in different ways makes this receptor attractive as target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
