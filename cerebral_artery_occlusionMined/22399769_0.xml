<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) offers a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; however, massive grafted cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following transplantation, possibly due to a hostile host brain environment, lessens the effectiveness of this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated whether reprogramming NSCs with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, a broadly used antibiotic also known to possess cytoprotective properties, enhances survival of grafted cells and promotes neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NSCs harvested from the subventricular zone of fetal rats were preconditioned with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> in vitro and transplanted into rat brains 6 h after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological and behavioral tests were examined from days 0-28 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vitro experiments, NSCs were subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> gene expression were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> preconditioning protected the grafted NSCs from ischemic reperfusion injury via upregulation of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, preconditioning with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> induced the NSCs to release paracrine factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transplantation of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>-preconditioned NSCs significantly attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological performance, compared with non-preconditioned NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection was abolished by transfecting the NSCs with Nrf2-small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, preconditioning with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, which reprograms NSCs to tolerate <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> after ischemic reperfusion injury and express higher levels of paracrine factors through Nrf2 up-regulation, is a simple and safe approach to enhance the effectiveness of transplantation therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
