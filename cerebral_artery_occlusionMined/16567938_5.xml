<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of early (&lt;6 h) versus delayed (&gt;6 h) recanalization on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (M1 segment; symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;6 h) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> MRI was performed immediately after admission (day 0), and on days 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, vessel status was assessed within 6 h, at 24 h and on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to early (&lt;/=6 h, n = 10), delayed (6-24 h, n = 8) or no recanalization within 24 h (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> patterns between the three subgroups were compared on normalized day 1 diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion plots were generated for the three subgroups depicting voxel by voxel the relative frequency of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion growth was significantly larger in the group without recanalization (125 +/- 100 cm(3); mean +/- SD) compared to patients with early (41 +/- 42 cm(3); p = 0.02) or delayed (47 +/- 45 cm(3); p &lt; 0.05) recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns revealed extensive sparing of peripheral cortical regions in both the early and delayed recanalization groups compared to the persistent occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the early/delayed recanalization groups, cortical involvement was often limited to the central <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (i.e. insular region and adjacent cortex, in addition to the basal ganglia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 80 +/- 71 cm(3) in patients with early, 93 +/- 62 cm(3) in those with delayed, and 194 +/- 156 cm(3) in those without recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delayed recanalization significantly limits DWI lesion expansion in patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and selectively saves peripheral cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collateral supply to the peripheral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory may be sufficient for an extended period of time </plain></SENT>
