<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix and are implicated in numerous pathological conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the brain, the endothelial cell wall, strengthened by tight junctions, defines the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix molecules constitute the basement membrane underlying the vasculature and play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there is a breakdown of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> with an associated increase in vascular permeability, inflammatory cell influx, and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the effects of MMP expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was produced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat, and MMP protein expression was measured by Western blot and zymogram analysis over a time course ranging from 6 hours to 30 days (n=32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry at 1 and 5 days (n=8 and 6, respectively) was also utilized to characterize the expression of several MMPs and related proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including their cellular source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that early increased MMP-9 expression is involved in ischemic brain injury, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against MMP-9 was administered intravenously (n=7 per group) 1 hour before MCAO, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP expression increased progressively over time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12 hours, significant (P&lt;0.05) MMP-9 activity was observed that reached maximum levels by 24 hours (P&lt;0.001), then persisted for 5 days at this level and returned to basal (zero) levels by 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of morphological criteria, MMP-9 appeared to stain with endothelial cells and neutrophils identified both within and at the periphery of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> within 24 hours of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 5 days, MMP-9 appeared to stain with macrophages present within the infarcted brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 activity was significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased by 24 hours and was maximum after 5 days following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 appeared to stain with macrophages present within the infarcted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unlike MMP-9 and MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was identified at comparable levels in both control and ischemic tissue after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 and MMP-3 could not be detected in the brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When an MMP-9-neutralizing monoclonal antibody was administered systemically, animals exhibited significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (ie, a 30% reduction compared with non-immune antibody controls; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that early increased MMP-9 expression in endothelial cells and infiltrating neutrophils is a significant response to cerebral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that selective inhibition of MMP-9 activity can significantly reduce brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
