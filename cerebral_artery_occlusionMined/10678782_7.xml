<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated expression of bag-1 protein in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, and compared the results with that of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that neuronal, choroid plexus, and ependymal cells were positively stained in the sham control brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 90 min of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, immunoreactivity for bag-1 progressively decreased from 3 to 48 h in the nuclei of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that immunoreactive bag-1 was markedly decreased in the nuclear fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cytosolic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fractions showed no or only slight change after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TUNEL positive cells appeared at 48 h after the reperfusion, which was preceded by loss of bag-1 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that bag-1 plays some roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuronal function, and its loss may be involved in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
