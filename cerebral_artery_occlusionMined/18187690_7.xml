<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> as a neuroprotective agent has been demonstrated using various models in which improvements in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, DNA damage, and neurological function were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further investigated neurohemodynamic aspects of the treatment-associated recovery by assessing the therapeutic efficacy of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment using functional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ipsilesional functional MRI activations in the somatosensory cortex, acquired 2 weeks after the 90-minute transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, were compared between <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>- and saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, MRI signal changes based on blood oxygenation level dependence and functional cerebral blood volume responses were examined using electrical stimulation of forelimbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional immunohistochemical assays were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratio of ipsilesional to contralesional blood oxygenation level dependence response magnitudes significantly improved with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increase of the functional cerebral blood volume response magnitude ratio was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment induced significant enhancements of total functional MRI activation (defined as a product of activation volume and response magnitude) for both blood oxygenation level dependence and functional cerebral blood volume methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased cerebral blood volume in periinfarct tissues suggests a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced vascular transformation in both saline- and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>-treated rats; however, other MRI-derived vascular parameters (vascular size index and microvascular volume) and immunohistochemical staining (CD31, glia fibrillary-associated protein, and matrix metalloproteinase-9) may imply that the neoformation of vasculature was differently affected by the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment enhanced the blood oxygenation level dependence functional MRI response magnitude in the absence of neurological improvement and influenced vascular formation in poststroke animal models </plain></SENT>
