<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this situation neuroprotective drugs may increase the safety of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> may inhibit ischemic damage by anti-excitotoxic, calcium channel blocking and vasodilatory action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some evidence suggests that intra-arterial administration might provide a much higher degree of protection than intravenous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study the neuroprotective efficacy of intra-arterial and intravenous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> administration was examined in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by an intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, animals received an infusion of either (1) vehicle (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> intra-arterially or (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local cortical blood flow (LCBF) was continuously measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were quantified daily, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed histologically after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: There was no difference between the treatment groups concerning LCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> serum levels increased from approximately 1 mmol/l to approximately 1.8 mmol/l by either route of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both intra-arterial and intravenous treatment improved neurological recovery and equally reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by approximately 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that there is no advantage of intra-arterial over intravenous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A comparison with previous studies suggests that even within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> concentrations, low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels may be hazardous and high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels may be protective in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
