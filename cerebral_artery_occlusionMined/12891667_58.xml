<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the effects of increased COX-2 activity in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using a transgenic mouse model in which human COX-2 is constitutively expressed selectively in neurons of the striatum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These COX-2 transgenic mice harbor elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) that are 10-fold higher than nontransgenic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 4 days of reperfusion in COX-2 transgenic mice as compared with nontransgenic littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of nontransgenic mice with the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC58236 resulted in a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in nontransgenic mice, consistent with previous pharmacological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, transgenic COX-2 mice treated with SC58236 did not show a significant reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increases in COX-2 expression and enzymatic activity, which can occur in aging and in pathological states characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory processes, can lead to downstream cellular changes that have a negative impact on neuronal survival in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
