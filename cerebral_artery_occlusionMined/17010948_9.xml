<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it was previously unclear whether this protection resulted from altered susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study examines the effects of late phase ischemic preconditioning in a mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific examination of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Intra-abdominal radiofrequency probes were implanted in animals and core temperature was regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to MCAO: (1) brief 15 min duration (preconditioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and (2) 45 min MCAO (injurious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Naive (i.e. not preconditioned) animals were compared with preconditioned animals (preconditioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plus injurious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at 72 h reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and magnetic resonance cerebral perfusion (MRP) arterial spin labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage of brain infarcted was compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rCBF was significantly improved in the preconditioned cohorts of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Naive animals showed flow reductions to 16+/-3.59% (MCAO_45; injurious, unpreconditioned) and 17.1+/-8.6% (MCAO_15; preconditioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> alone) of baseline, while preconditioned animals had flows 33.9+/-13.2% (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>_45; preconditioned animals with injurious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at 72 h reperfusion) of baseline (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Percentage of brain infarcted was 17.2+/-6.2% in naive animals, while it was 5.1+/-4.6% in the preconditioned animals (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRP of the perfusion to the ischemic hemisphere, in a striatal coronal slice of the brain was 26.7+/-5.8% of the contralateral hemisphere in naive animals while preconditioned mice had flows of 38.7+/-6.8% of contralateral (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improved rCBF is an important factor in the protection of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, during injurious MCAO in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stringent monitoring of rCBF is required in future studies of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
