<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory processes have been implicated in the mechanisms of reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The migration of leukocytes into ischemic tissue on reperfusion, which involves binding to the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM) of the endothelial cell, is thought to exacerbate tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody on reperfusion-induced injury after late reperfusion in a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The animals were divided into four groups: 1) Group 1 (n = 7), 6 hours of permanent MCAO; 2) Group 2 (n = 7), 3 hours of MCAO followed by 3 hours of reperfusion; 3) Group 3 (n = 6), 6 hours of permanent MCAO and treatment with anti-ICAM-1 antibody (designated 1A29, 1 mg/kg) at 2 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO; and 4) Group 4 (n = 6), 3 hours of MCAO followed by 3 hours of reperfusion and 1A29 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the experiment, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmetric scanning technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 6-hour time point, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were killed, and the results of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> by myeloperoxidase activity and histological analysis using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regional cerebral blood flow values before and after MCAO were not significantly different among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow values after reperfusion were not significantly different in the two reperfused groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage brain injury volumes in both the total and cortical areas and the myeloperoxidase activity in the latter were significantly larger in Group 2 (the reperfused group) than in the other groups (P &lt; 0.05) but were decreased by anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment (Group 2 versus Group 4, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences between Groups 1 and 3 without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activities correlated positively with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that the anti-ICAM antibody treatment is effective at inhibiting early inflammatory processes and reperfusion-induced injury caused by late arterial recanalization, which would contribute to widening the therapeutic window of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
