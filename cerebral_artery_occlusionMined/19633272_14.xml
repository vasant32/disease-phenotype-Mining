<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmortem histological analysis investigated possible mechanisms of behavioral recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), rats were treated with 4500, 45,000, or 450,000 CTX0E03 cells or vehicle implanted into the putamen with testing on a battery of tasks preocclusion and postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of brains included assessment of lesion volumes, implant cell survival and differentiation, changes to host brain matrix, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and neurogenesis using immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant dose-related recovery in sensorimotor function deficits (bilateral asymmetry test [BAT; P &lt; .0002] in the mid- and high-dose groups and rotameter test after <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> exposure [P &lt; .05] in the high-dose group) was found in the CTX0E03 cell implanted groups compared to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-life functional improvements correlated with cell dose, though did not correlate with survival of CTX0E03 cells measured at postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surviving CTX0E03 cells differentiated into oligodendroglial and endothelial phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCAO-induced reduction of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was partially restored to that observed in sham operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse CTX0E03 cell-related effects were observed during in-life observations or on tissue histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study found that the implantation of CTX0E03 human neural stem cells in rats after MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promoted significant behavioral recovery depending on cell dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors propose a paracrine trophic mechanism, which is triggered early after CTX0E03 cell implantation, and which in turn targets restoration of neurogenesis in the SVZ of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
