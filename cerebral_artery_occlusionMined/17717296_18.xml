<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway mediates the neuroprotective effect of combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) and tPA (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume, whereas monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tPA did not reduce the lesion volume, when the treatments were initiated 4 hours after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> alone and in combination treatment with tPA significantly increased Akt phosphorylation compared with treatment with saline and tPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> completely abolished the reduction of lesion volume afforded by combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR analysis of cerebral endothelial cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection from the ischemic boundary region showed that MCAo upregulated early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and tPA monotherapy further increased Egr-1 and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tPA significantly suppressed Egr-1 and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in cerebral endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activation of Akt and downregulation of cerebral endothelial Egr-1 and VEGF gene expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> contribute to the neuroprotective effect of combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tPA </plain></SENT>
