<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the neuroprotective efficacy associated with post-ischemic vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein-1 (VAP-1) blockade in rats subjected to transient (1 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared saline-treated control rats to rats treated with a highly selective VAP-1 inhibitor, LJP-1586 [Z-3-fluoro-2-(4-methoxybenzyl) allylamine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial intraperitoneal LJP-1586 (or saline control) treatments were delayed until 6 h or 12 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 72-h reperfusion, LJP-1586-treated rats displayed 51% and 33% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, relative to their controls, in the 6- and 12-h treatment groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only in the 6-h treatment group was the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we observed significantly improved neurologic functions in both 6- and 12-h treatment groups, versus their matched controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the effect of 6-h LJP-1586 treatment on post-ischemic leukocyte trafficking in pial venules overlying the ischemic cortex was evaluated using intravital microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experiments revealed that: 1) LJP-1586 did not affect intravascular leukocyte (largely neutrophil) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, at least out to 12-h reperfusion; and 2) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neutrophil extravasation, which occurred between 6-8-h reperfusion in control rats, was prevented by LJP-1586-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in rats subjected to transient MCAo, selective VAP-1 pharmacologic blockade provided neuroprotection, with a prolonged therapeutic window of 6-12-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
