<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) inhibitors improve functional recovery in experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats when treatment is delayed and without effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PDE5A is expressed to only a very limited extent in forebrain tissues, raising the possibility that the locus of effect for the inhibitors is outside the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To start to address this question, we determined whether PDE5A inhibitors must have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier to improve recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats, PF-5 and UK-489,791, PDE5A inhibitors that do or do not pass the blood brain barrier, were administered starting 24 h after occlusion and continued for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor function was assessed at intervals to 28 days using body swing and limb placement measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both PF-5 and UK-489,791 produced improvement in motor scores over 28 days that were significantly greater than in vehicle treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in efficacy between the two PDE5A inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain penetrability appears not to be critical to the ability of a PDE5A inhibitor to improve functional recovery after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding is discussed with regard to the cellular target(s) for PDE5A inhibitors mediating this effect </plain></SENT>
