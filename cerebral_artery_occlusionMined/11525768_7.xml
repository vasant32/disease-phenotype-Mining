<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, NAAG and 2-(phosphonomethyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17859">pentanedioic acid</z:chebi> (2-PMPA), a potent and selective NAALADase inhibitor, were found to be neuroprotective in neuronal/glial co-cultures and in animals following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we examined the involvement of glial cells and metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (mGlu) receptors in neuroprotection mediated by NAAG and 2-PMPA in an in vitro model of metabolic inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection of neuronal/glial co-cultures by both NAAG and 2-PMPA, against metabolic inhibition, was significantly higher than neuroprotection in the absence of glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG IV), a selective group II mGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, was less neuroprotective in the absence of glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selective group II mGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and (S)-alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a non-selective mGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, reduced the protection afforded by both NAAG and 2-PMPA when using neuronal/glial co-cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, groups I and III mGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> did not affect NAAG or 2-PMPA neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the critical involvement of glia and group II mGlu receptors in NAAG and 2-PMPA-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
