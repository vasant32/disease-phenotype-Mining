<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into four experimental groups, each of 21 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first two were exposed to 95% inspired normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> for 4 h/day for 6 consecutive days (intermittent normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>) or for 24 h continuous (prolonged normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second two groups acted as controls, and were exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
