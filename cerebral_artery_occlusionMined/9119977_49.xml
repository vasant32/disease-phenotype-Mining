<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/JE), a member of the beta-chemokine (C-C chemokine) family, functions as a potent chemoattractant and activator for monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the induction of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA using in situ hybridization histochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) and characterized its cellular source by combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> and immunocytochemistry in ischemic rat brains as well as in brains of endotoxin-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that 6 h-2 d after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA is present in astrocytes surrounding the ischemic tissue (penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At later time points (after 4 d), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA is found in macrophages and reactive microglia in the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral administration of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) induced <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA throughout the brain in a time-dependent manner (1 h-1 d, peak of expression 6-8 h) and was found in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have found expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in (a) astrocytes and to a lesser extent in macrophages/reactive microglia after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occlusion and in (b) astrocytes after peripheral administration of LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is involved in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> trauma or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and thus may play a key role in inflammatory processes of the brain </plain></SENT>
