<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a rat model of detrusor overactivity caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), we undertook the present study to determine whether the effect of an alpha1-blocker, naftopidil, is dependent on the suppression of C-fiber afferents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To induce desensitization of C-fiber bladder afferents, we injected resiniferatoxin (0.3 mg/kg, RTX) sub-cutaneously to female Sprague-Dawley rats 2 days prior to left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (RTX-CI rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls we used rats without RTX treatment (CI rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO and insertion of a <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> catheter through the bladder dome were performed under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects on cystometrography (CMG) of intravenous (i.v.), intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of naftopidil in conscious CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity (BC) was markedly reduced after MCAO in both RTX-CI and CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>I.v. administration of naftopidil significantly increased BC in CI rats without an increase in residual volume, but it had no effects on BC in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>I.t. administration of naftopidil significantly increased BC in CI but not in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that naftopidil has an inhibitory effect on C-fiber afferents in the lumbosacral spinal cord, improving BC during the storage phase </plain></SENT>
