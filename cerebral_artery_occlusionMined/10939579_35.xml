<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because a variety of neuroprotective genes are induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we examined the effect of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, produced by 20 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats, on CB1 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that CB1 expression on neurons was increased in the arterial boundary zone of the cortical mantle, beginning by 2 hours and persisting for 72 hours or more after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> These findings are consistent with a neuroprotective role for endogenous cannabinoid signaling pathways and with a potential therapeutic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for drugs that activate CB1 receptors </plain></SENT>
