<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were divided into five equal groups of each consisting of seven rats: control, I/R, I/R + DHA, I/R + <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3), and I/R + <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17242,27956">dehydroascorbic acid</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were found to be increased in the I/R group, I/R + DHA, and I/R + <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) groups compared with the control group in both cortex and corpus striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level were found to be significantly decreased in only I/R + <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) + DHA group compared with the I/R group in cortex (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
