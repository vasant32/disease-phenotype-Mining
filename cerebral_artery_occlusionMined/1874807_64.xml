<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local blood flow and amino acid incorporation were measured by double tracer autoradiography, and local ATP content by substrate-induced bioluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The various images were evaluated at the striatal level in cerebral cortex by scanning with a microdensitometer with 75 microns resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each 75 x 75 microns digitized image pixel was then converted into the appropriate units of either protein synthesis, ATP content, or blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic threshold was defined as the flow rate at which 50% of pixels exhibited complete metabolic suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the threshold of protein synthesis was 55.3 +/- 12.0 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and that of energy failure was 18.5 +/- 9.8 ml 100 g-1 min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 6 and 12 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the threshold of protein synthesis did not change (52.0 +/- 9.6 and 56.0 +/- 6.5 ml 100 g-1 min-1, respectively) but the threshold of energy failure increased significantly at 12 h following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion to 31.9 +/- 9.7 ml 100 g-1 min-1 (p less than 0.05 compared to 1 h ATP threshold value; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values are mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, therefore, the threshold of energy failure gradually approached that of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that with increasing duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, survival of brain tissue is determined by the high threshold of persisting inhibition of protein synthesis and not by the much lower one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> energy failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
