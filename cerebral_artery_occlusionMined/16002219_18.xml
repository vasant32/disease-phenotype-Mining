<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate whether hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has a protective effect on brain injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion, and to determine the possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of brain was assessed in brain slices stained with 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectrophotometric assay was used to determine the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), and the activity of total antioxidative capability (T-AOC) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that treatment with HSYA (2, 4, 8 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly decreased neurological deficit scores and reduced the percentage of infarction in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, HSYA treatment significantly attenuated the elevation of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, the decrease in SOD activity, and the T-AOC in the ipsilateral hemisphere and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these findings suggest that HSYA might provide neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury through its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> action </plain></SENT>
