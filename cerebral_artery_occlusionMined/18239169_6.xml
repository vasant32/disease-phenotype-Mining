<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> have long been regarded as a risk factor for the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but may reduce the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by inducing ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present objective was to develop an ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) model of delayed tolerance in the mouse based on repetitive, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> underwent <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, which consisted of repetitive MCAO at 45-minute intervals by the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 90-minute test MCAO was performed 24 to 96 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using an <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> of 2 5-minute MCAO episodes, the reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from the test MCAO was maximal with a 72-hour delay in striatum (70%) and cerebral cortex (64%) when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> was used for surgical anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia, the reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was less prominent in striatum (34%) and not significant in cortex (9%) despite similar levels of arterial pressure and decreases in cortical perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was rare 6 days after this <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus alone with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing the severity of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> to 3 5-minute bouts or 1 15-minute bout of MCAO in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia augmented the reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in striatum and cortex, but it also augmented selective neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in striatum after the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that a repetitive focal <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus can be titrated to induce delayed tolerance in both striatum and cortex of the mouse without inducing neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by itself </plain></SENT>
