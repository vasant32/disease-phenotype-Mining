<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic episodes lead to endothelial cell damage, deleterious <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, and altered neuronal and astrocyte regulation of vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These, in turn, can lead to impaired cerebral blood flow and compromised blood-brain barrier function, promoting microvascular collapse, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, hemorrhagic transformation, and worsened neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC), a widely expressed serine/threonine kinase, is involved in mediating arterial tone and microvascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is no clear understanding about the role of individual PKC isozymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that intraperitoneal injection of deltaV1-1-TAT(47-57) (0.2 mg/kg in 1 mL), an isozyme-specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor of deltaPKC, improved microvascular pathology, increased the number of patent microvessels by 92% compared to control-treated animals, and increased cerebral blood flow by 26% following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> delivery of deltaV1-1-TAT(47-57) in hypertensive Dahl rats increased cerebral blood flow by 12%, and sustained delivery deltaV1-1-TAT(47-57) (5 uL/h, 1 mM), reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 25% following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings demonstrate that deltaPKC is an important therapeutic target for protection of microvascular structure and function under both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions of cerebrovascular stress </plain></SENT>
