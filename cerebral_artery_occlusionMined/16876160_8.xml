<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is increasingly recognized in preterm and term infants but the ability to study this condition has been limited by the technical challenges in developing suitable animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study we report the use of transient filament middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1.5 h in 10-day-old rat pups in which we were able to perform serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial MRI was performed immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> until 28 days after injury in an 11.7 T scanner using diffusion weighted and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 28 days the rat pups were sacrificed and standard histological stains were performed to validate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial behavioral assessments were also performed on the day of each imaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomical distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was similar to that expected from occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in adult models and represents a specific model of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in contrast to the commonly used model of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 8% <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements was 39% of the ipsilateral hemisphere at 0 h post-occlusion, reached a maximum at 24 h (44%) and then decreased in size (17%) with subsequent cavitation by 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infarction was more visible early with diffusion weighted imaging whereas T2-mapping provided more accurate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the relatively large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, we saw little evidence of behavioral neurological deficit suggesting that this may also serve as a model of developmental plasticity and recovery </plain></SENT>
