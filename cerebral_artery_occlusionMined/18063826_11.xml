<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Notch activation promotes neural progenitor cell (NPC) self-renewal in the developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-induced NPC proliferation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is mediated by PS1 and Notch1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PS1 and NICD expressions were measured in retired breeder rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> that were left untreated or treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-induced NPC self-renewal, subventricular zone (SVZ) neurosphere culture and knockdown of Notch1 gene expression by short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SVZ neurosphere formation, cell proliferation, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased the numbers of newly generated neuroblasts and promoted PS1 and NICD expression in the ipsilateral and homologous contralateral SVZ compared with saline-treated control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased SVZ neurosphere formation and cell proliferation were found in cultured neurospheres derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat and poststroke rat SVZs treated in vitro with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> compared with untreated neurospheres (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased PS1 and hairy and enhancer of split1 (Hes1) gene expression in cultured SVZ neurospheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PS1 significantly decreased NICD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown of Notch1 expression, decreased NPC proliferation, and NICD and hairy and enhancer of split1 expression in cultured neurosphere cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> increases the NPC pool in older rats and that it also upregulates PS1 expression and Notch1 signaling activity, which in turn, facilitate an increase in SVZ NPC proliferation </plain></SENT>
