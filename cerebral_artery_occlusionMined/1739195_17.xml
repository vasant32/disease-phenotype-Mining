<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The middle cerebral artery was occluded with a Yasargil clip transorbitally either temporarily (0.5, four, and eight hours) or permanently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normoglycemic and hyperglycemic animals were closely monitored for eight hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain pathology was assessed after two weeks' survival or at the time of spontaneous animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Topographic brain metabolite studies were carried out after four hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Morphometric quantitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and infarction and fluorometric determinations of blood and brain tissue, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>, and phosphocreatine from 16 topographic brain sites were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 82 (25.6%) animals evaluated neuropathologically showed hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occluding the artery in hyperglycemic animals caused fivefold more frequent and 25-fold more extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in normoglycemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary occlusion with clip release after four hours in hyperglycemic animals caused the most extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (81%) took place in animals that died within a few hours after they experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that showed infarction and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the entire middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses demonstrated a close relation between <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and near-total energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>, less than 0.3 microM/g; phosphocreatine, less than 0.5 microM/g) in brain sites that showed extremely high tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations (more than 30 microM/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The biochemical changes that correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more marked than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and restoration of blood flow to ischemic territories were strong risk factors for hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Concomitant tissue metabolic changes suggest that marked tissue energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> damages brain vessels and renders them penetrable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid and, ultimately, red blood cell extravasation </plain></SENT>
