<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of MK-801 on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and cerebral blood flow in temporary and permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Wistar rats exposed to permanent right common carotid artery and 2 h of transient right middle cerebral and left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 22 h of reperfusion, MK-801 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 73% (P less than 0.05) and significantly increased cerebral blood flow to the ischemic core throughout the 2-h period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exposed to permanent right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 2 h of transient right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 22 h of reperfusion, MK-801 decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 13% (P greater than 0.05) and increased cerebral blood flow to the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SHRs subjected to permanent right common carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> MK-801 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 18% at 3 h (P greater than 0.05), by 25% at 6 h (P less than 0.01) and by 18% at 24 h (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK-801-treated SHRs had no difference in cerebral blood flow to the ischemic core, but increased cerebral blood flow to penumbral zones as compared with untreated SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the protective effect of MK-801, at least in part, relates to improved cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
