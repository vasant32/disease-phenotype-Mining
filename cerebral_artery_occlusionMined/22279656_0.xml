<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into five groups: model group, shame (SH) control group and 3 theanine groups (Th-L,Th-M and Th-H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats in model and SH groups were given distilled water, and the rats in Th groups were given theanine solution (10, 30 and 90 mg/kg respectively) intragastrically for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the model and Th groups, and SH group was used as a fake surgery control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The score of neurological behavior was evaluated at the 3rd and 24th hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 24h after reperfusion, and the brain index was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyricacid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) and theanine (The) in rat brain following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 mRNA in hippocampi were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with model control group, the neurological deficits of theanine treated groups were milder; and the symptoms were more gently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concentration of neurotransmitter Asp was lower while the Gly and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> were higher, and a trend of dose-effect relation was existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expressions of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 mRNA in hippocampi were up-regulated in the theanine treated groups compared with model group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Theanine has a protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in rats, which may be associated with its interaction with amino acid <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> and up-regulating the expression of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
