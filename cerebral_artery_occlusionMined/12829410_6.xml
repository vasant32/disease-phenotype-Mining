<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, neuronal cells derived from a human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_321'>teratocarcinoma</z:mpath> cell line, called hNT neurons or LBS neurons (clinical grade preparation), are effective in improving behavioral recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the elderly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is a common sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially if the infarction involves cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of implanting neural cells on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> susceptibility in the MCAO model has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, MCAO-lesioned and MCAO-lesioned rats in which the LBS neurons were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 60 min of MCAO using the intraluminal filament technique followed 3-4 weeks later by transplantation of 80,000 LBS-neurons into the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to PTZ-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was tested 4-6 weeks post-transplant at doses of 35, 50 and 70 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Latency to the first lethal response, latency to first generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, duration of the first generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, and the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> in an hour post-PTZ treatment observation period was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even thought there was a tendency for groups that underwent MCAO to be more susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups and no differences between MCAO alone and MCAO animals in which cells had been implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While grafted cells were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one injected animal, the results suggest that the grafts may not have been healthy either from immunological rejection or PTZ-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that while placing cells within the cortex does not reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> susceptibility, it also does not increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are warranted </plain></SENT>
