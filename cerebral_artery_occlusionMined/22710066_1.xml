<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, hemorrhagic transformation, neurotoxicity, and a short treatment time window comprise major limitations for thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether fasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, would prevent tPA-associated hemorrhagic transformation and extend the reperfusion window in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice subjected to 6-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with delayed tPA alone, with combined tPA plus fasudil, or with a vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used histological and neurobehavioral measures to assess the effects of the treatment at 18 h and 7 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism of fasudil's beneficial effects further, we also performed an in vitro study with tPA and fasudil in human brain microvascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with tPA plus fasudil prevented the development of hemorrhagic transformation, but did not reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes significantly reduced mortality and <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>increased locomotor activity</z:mp> at 7 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the administration of both drugs prevented injury to the human brain endothelial cells via the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that fasudil prevents the hemorrhagic transformation induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice treated with tPA, at least in part, by inhibiting the increased activity of MMP-9 in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
