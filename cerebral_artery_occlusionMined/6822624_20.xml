<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gyral topography of the ischaemic penumbra associated with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was studied in cats; local blood flow (hydrogen clearance, 2-min initial slope analysis), pial surface <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> activity (Kp), and electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude were recorded on the ectosylvian, suprasylvian, and marginal gyri </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Penumbral conditions were defined as a reduction of EEG amplitude in the absence of a major increase in Kp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole hemisphere cerebral blood flow prior to occlusion was 35.6 +/- 11.4 (SD) ml 100 g-1 min-1 (n = 25), and fell significantly (p less than 0.001) to 13.0 +/- 4.7 (SD), 14.1 +/- 6.6, and 23.8 +/- 9.3 on ectosylvian, suprasylvian, and marginal gyri, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-occlusion Kp was 3.0 +/- 0.9 mM (n = 53); sustained, steady-state increases in excess of 11.5 mM occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) experiments on ectosylvian gyrus, in 13 of 22 (59%) experiments on suprasylvian gyrus, and in 2 of 24 experiments on marginal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient increases in Kp occurred at occlusion and resolved to baselines significantly higher than control in 5 (23%) experiments in suprasylvian gyrus and in 15 (63%) on marginal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 experiments on the marginal gyrus (29%), no increase in Kp greater than 1 mM occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EEG amplitude on this gyrus was reduced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 25 of 26 experiments, and it is concluded that this gyrus is the principal site of ischaemic penumbra in the model; in 41% of experiments similar conditions were also present on the suprasylvian gyrus </plain></SENT>
