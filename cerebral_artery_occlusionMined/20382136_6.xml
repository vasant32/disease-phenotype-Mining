<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several hypotheses to account for these therapeutic effects have been suggested, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is thought to be largely responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs were intravenously infused into rats in the relatively later time points after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to determine if they could contribute to neovascularization and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although MRI analysis revealed that only rats receiving MSCs 7days after MCAO exhibited decreased ischemic lesion volume than the control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MSCs treated rats receiving MSCs up to 1month after MCAO had greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> near the border of the ischemic lesions and showed greater functional recovery in the treadmill stress test than did control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results suggest that the time window of MSC therapy is at least over 1 month after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the rat permanent MCAO model, and systemic delivery of MSCs in the later phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may have beneficial effect through an angiogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
