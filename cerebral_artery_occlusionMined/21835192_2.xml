<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SP-8203 significantly improved spatial learning and memory in the water maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provided strong pharmacological basis for its potential therapeutic roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
