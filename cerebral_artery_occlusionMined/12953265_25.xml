<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the second-generation azulenyl nitrone, stilbazunenlyl nitrone (STAZN), in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiologically monitored rats received 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture, resulting in substantial cortical and striatal infarcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavior was quantified on a standard battery, and brains were perfusion-fixed for quantitative histopathology at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 independent series, rats were treated at either 2h + 4h, or 2h + 4h + 24h + 48h, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; vehicle-treated rats received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals (n = 52) developed high-grade neurological deficits (score 11 of 12) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which improved, in STAZN-treated rats, within 1-1.5 h of the initial dose and fell to a median score of 3 at 72 h, compared to 8 in vehicle rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STAZN treatment reduced mean cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 64-97%, and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 42-72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In over one-half of STAZN-treated animals, cortical infarction was virtually abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis predicted that STAZN would confer approximately 50% cortical neuroprotection even in the most severely affected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potency of STAZN was orders-of-magnitude greater than other nitrones such as NXY-059 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that STAZN has great promise for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
