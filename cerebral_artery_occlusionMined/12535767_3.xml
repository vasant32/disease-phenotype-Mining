<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Laser Doppler technique has emerged as an important tool in neuroscience research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This non-invasive method scans a low-power laser beam in a raster pattern over a tissue surface to generate the time course of images in unit of relative flux changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler imager (LDI) records cerebral perfusion not only in the temporal but also in the spatial domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The traditional analysis of LD images has been focused on the region-of-interest (ROI) approach, in which the analytical accuracy in an experiment that necessitates a relative repositioning between the LDI and the scanned tissue area will be weakened due to the operator's subjective decision in data collecting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report describes a robust image registration method designed to obviate this problem, which is based on the adaptive correlation approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The assumption in mapping corresponding pixels in two images is to correlate the regions in which these pixels are centered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on this assumption, correlation coefficients are calculated between two regions by a method in which one region is moved around over the other in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To avoid ambiguity in distinguishing maximum correlation coefficients, an adaptive algorithm is adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correspondences are then used to estimate the transformation by linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We used a pair of phantom LD images to test this algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A reliability test was also performed on each of the 15 sequential LD images derived from an actual experiment by imposing rotation and translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The result shows that the calculated transformation parameters (rotation: theta =7.7+/-0.5 degrees; translation: Delta x =2.8+/-0.3, Delta≈∑=4.7+/-0.4) are very close to the prior-set parameters (rotation: theta=8 degrees; translation: Delta x=3, Delta y=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that this approach is a valuable adjunct to LD perfusion monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An original sequence of LD images that recorded cerebral perfusion through a cranial window before, during and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) is presented, together with the registered image sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion data acquired in a pixel-based manner from different anatomic locations of the registered LD image sequence are also presented over the whole time-course of the experiment </plain></SENT>
