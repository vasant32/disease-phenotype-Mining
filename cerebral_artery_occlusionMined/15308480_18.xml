<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether and how genetic deficiency of either lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) or macrophage-1 (Mac-1) alters the blood cell-endothelial cell interactions, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction in the mouse brain exposed to focal I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 1 h (followed by either 4 or 24 h of reperfusion) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and in mice with null mutations for either LFA-1 or Mac-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were monitored for 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet- and leukocyte-vessel wall adhesive interactions were monitored in cortical venules by intravital microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice with null mutations for LFA-1 or Mac-1 exhibited significant reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a significant improvement in the I/R-induced neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in cerebral venules did not differ between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant mice at 4 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after 24 h of reperfusion, leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was reduced in both LFA-1- and Mac-1-deficient mice compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was also reduced at both 4 and 24 h after reperfusion in the LFA-1- and Mac-1-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that both alpha-subunits of the beta2-integrins contribute to the brain injury and blood cell-vessel wall interactions that are associated with transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
