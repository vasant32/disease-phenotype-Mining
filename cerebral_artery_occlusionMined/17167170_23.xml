<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PPARdelta subtype has the highest expression in the brain and is postulated to play a major role in neuronal cell function; however, the precise physiological roles of this receptor remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show that the high-affinity PPARdelta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> L-165041 [4-[3-(4-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)-propoxyl]phenoxy]-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>] and GW501516 [2-methyl4-((4-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1,3-triazol-5-yl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48563">methylsulfanyl</z:chebi>)phenoxy <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>] protect against cytotoxin-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury in vitro and both ischemic brain injury and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17963">1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine</z:chebi> (MPTP) neurotoxicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SH-SY5Y studies, treatment with L-165041 or GW501516 significantly and concentration-dependently attenuated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following thapsigargin, 1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-phenylpyridinium, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> exposure, with the extent of damage correlated with the level of caspase-3 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the transient (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of ischemic brain injury in rats, i.c.v. infusion of L-165041 or GW501516 significantly attenuated the ischemic brain damage measured 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the PPARdelta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> also significantly attenuated MPTP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and related metabolite contents in mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that subtype-selective PPARdelta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> possess antiapoptotic properties in vitro, which may underlie their potential neuroprotective potential in in vivo experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that PPARdelta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> could be useful tools for understanding the role of PPARdelta in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, as well as attractive therapeutic candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
