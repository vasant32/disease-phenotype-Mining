<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors tested the hypothesis that oxygen metabolism is the key factor linking the long-term viability of ischemic brain tissue to the magnitude of residual blood flow during the first 6 hours following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven anesthetized pigs underwent a series of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography studies to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism before and for 7 hours after the animals were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of collateral blood supply was assessed using angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>Abnormal metabolism</z:mp> of the ischemic tissue progressed as a function of time in inverse proportion to the magnitude of residual CBF, and the volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> grew in inverse proportion to the residual blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten hours after occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> topographically matched the tissue with a cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption below 50% of values measured on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was also the threshold for the decline of the oxygen extraction fraction below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, which was critical for the prediction of nonviable ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mildly ischemic tissue (CBF &gt; 30 ml/100 g/min) did not reach the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen threshold of viability during the first 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; moderately ischemic tissue (CBF 12-30 m1/100 g/ min) reached the threshold of viability in 3 hours; and severely ischemic tissue (CBF &lt; 12 ml/100 g/min) remained viable for less than 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the residual CBF and both oxygen metabolism and extraction is critical to the evolution of metabolic deficiency and lesion size after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
