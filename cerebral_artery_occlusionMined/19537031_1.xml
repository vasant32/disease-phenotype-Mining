<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four SD rats were randomly divided into 2 equal groups and received intra-ventricular injection with rAAV1-VEGF or rAAV1-lacZ as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>21 days later the rats underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological severity score (NSS) was recorded 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>48 rats were sacrificed 21 days after MCAO and brains were taken out from 48 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immune quantitative analysis was used to identify the quantity of VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the site of VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence double labeling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and 5-bromodeoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> (BrdU) was performed to detect the proliferation of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">Fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> was infused into the caudal vein of 8 rats from each group and then the rats were killed with their brains taken out to evaluate the cerebral microvessel perfusion and microvessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NSSs of the VEGF group 7, 14, and 21 days after MCAO were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly lower than those of the control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), and the VEGF165 protein expression quantity was 27 times as that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that VEGF expression was distributed mainly in the caudate putamen, corpus callosum, choroid plexus, and hippocampus in the VEGF group, while no expression was detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microvessel density of the VEGF group was 157 +/- 13, significantly higher than that of the control group [(89 +/- 9), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BrdU +/vWF + endothelial cells were detected in the area adjacent to the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The density of microvessel infused with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> was (152,617 +/- 13,076) microm2/mm2 in the VEGF group, significantly higher than that of the control group [(91,658 +/- 6577) microm2/mm2 P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rAAV1 mediates the VEGF gene expression in multiple structures in the brain and attenuates the neurological deficit of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>VEGF gene transfer may stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and improves blood supply in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization may be a therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
