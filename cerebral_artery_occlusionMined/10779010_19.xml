<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytokine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor (LIF) modulates neuronal function during development and promotes neuronal survival after peripheral nerve injury, but little is known about LIF expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the localization of LIF protein was immunohistochemically examined in rats after 3.5, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours of reperfusion following 1.5 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double-staining immunohistochemistry with microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), lectin histochemistry, and interleukin (IL) 6 was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sham group and immunosorption test did not show any clear LIF immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Definite LIF immunoreactivity was first detected after 12 hours of reperfusion in each of the brain regions examined: ischemic core, periinfarct region, and contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, expression of LIF was most prominent in the periinfarct region at each time point, peaked at 24 hours, and then gradually declined until 96 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some LIF-positive neurons in the periinfarct region expressed IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 96 hours of reperfusion, GFAP-labeled astrocytes around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core also expressed LIF protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of LIF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was also confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that LIF expression in ischemically threatened neurons may reflect a repair or defense mechanism against the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
