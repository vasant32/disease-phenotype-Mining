<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal experiments had shown that this response can be used as an index of the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 3 out of 4 patients of bilateral A1 occlusion, the amplitude of DCR decreased, and two of them showed complete disappearance of DCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, only one patient showed amplitude decrease of DCR to half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results might indicate the difference of collateral circulatory flow in each individual case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest monitoring of DCR in temporal occlusion to be a most important practical method for ascertaining the maximal duration of temporary occlusion possible without causing infarction </plain></SENT>
