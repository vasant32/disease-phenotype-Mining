<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The P450 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are produced in brain and perform important biological functions, including protection from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of EETs, however, is limited by their metabolism via soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase (sEH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that sEH inhibition is protective against ischemic brain damage in vivo by a mechanism linked to enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined expression and distribution of sEH immunoreactivity (IR) in brain, and examined the effect of sEH inhibitor 12-(3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40519">adamantan</z:chebi>-1-yl-ureido)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30805">dodecanoic acid</z:chebi> butyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (AUDA-BE) on CBF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of AUDA-BE (10 mg/kg) or vehicle at 30 mins before 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or at reperfusion, in the presence and absence of P450 epoxygenase inhibitor N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl) hexanamide (MS-PPOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for sEH was detected in vascular and non-vascular brain compartments, with predominant expression in neuronal cell bodies and processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12-(3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40519">Adamantan</z:chebi>-1-yl-ureido)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30805">dodecanoic acid</z:chebi> butyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> was detected in plasma and brain for up to 24 h after intraperitoneal injection, which was associated with inhibition of sEH activity in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, AUDA-BE significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 h after MCAO, which was prevented by MS-PPOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, regional CBF rates measured by iodoantipyrine (IAP) autoradiography at end <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> revealed no differences between AUDA-BE- and vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that sEH inhibition is protective against ischemic injury by non-vascular mechanisms, and that sEH may serve as a therapeutic target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
