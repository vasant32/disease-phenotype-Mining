<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess whether dimethylthiourea (DMTU), an established free radical scavenger, ameliorates ischaemic damage due to 2-3 h of transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, induced by an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major point addressed was whether DMTU given before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion only delayed the "maturation" of the damage, or if it had a lasting effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end point was morphological, and either encompassed triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining of tissue slices after 24 h or 48 h of recovery, or histopathological assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after 7 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary series of experiments, rats were subjected to 3 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed by TTC staining after 24 h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DMTU in a dose of 750 mg/kg reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, due to a high mortality rate, that protocol was not subsequently pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> duration was reduced to 2 h and the DMTU dose to 400 mg/kg, a similar amelioration of the tissue damage was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, since DMTU reduced a spontaneous rise in body temperature to 39.0-39.5 degrees C, DMTU-treated animals in the main series of experiments with 24 and 48 h of recovery were treated so that they had the same temperature rise as the saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under such constant temperature conditions, the effect of DMTU at 24 h of recovery was borderline (P = 0.052) and at 48 h it was nil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of a lasting effect of DMTU was supported by the findings on evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area after 7 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results raise the important question whether DMTU, and perhaps other free radical scavengers, delay rather than ameliorate the ischaemic lesion developing after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
