<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aesein for 7 d and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was evaluated by the Longa's method; The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed by hemmatoxylin-Eosin staining and the cerebral water content was measured by dry weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activities of SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> -K+ -ATPase and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content were measured in the cortex and hippocampus of ischemic and non-ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin significantly reduced the volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and water content, and ameliorated the neurological deficit (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated rats, the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> -K+ -ATPase in the cortex and hippocampus of ischemic hemisphere were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased (P &lt; 0.01) , while the CAT activity was slightly elevated and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> of content was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin, the effects on recovery of SOD, GSH-Px, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> -K+ -ATPase activities were observed (P &lt; 0.05), and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content was reduced (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> beta-aescin can attenuate brain injury and its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity on rats which encountered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
