<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is an archetypal member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP) family, which inactivates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) including JNK through dephosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MKP-1, one of immediate early genes in stress conditions, was induced at transcriptional level in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/re-oxygenation (H/R) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> N1E115 cells, however the activation of JNK was not suppressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of re-oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated knock-down of MKP-1 enhanced phospho-JNK and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that is rescued by JNK inhibitor in H/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, conditional over-expression of MKP-1 suppressed phospho-JNK, the expression of proapoptotic genes, and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in H/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further the immunoreactivity of MKP-1 was detected in the neurons and partially co-localized with that of phospho-JNK in the surrounding zone of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rat <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that over-expression of MKP-1 could suppress neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> possibly through regulating JNK signaling in vitro and be a prominent neuroprotective target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
