<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The importance of mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models has increased with the development of genetically manipulated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that immediate postischemia <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may attenuate ischemic brain injury in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intraabdominal radio frequency probes were implanted in animals and core temperature monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups included: MCAO-45-REG (45 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> [MCAO]) temperature-controlled in the postischemic period &gt;34 degrees C for 24 hours; MCAO-45 (45 minutes MCAO) were allowed to self-regulate core temperature during recovery; MCAO-30-REG (30 minutes MCAO), with the same temperature protocol as MCAO-45-REG; MCAO-30 (30 minutes MCAO), with temperature protocol the same as MCAO-45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavior and histological score was assessed at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The qualitative histological score assessed for injury in 18 specified regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCAO-45-REG core temperature (mean 34.94 degrees C+/-0.8 degrees C) was significantly different than the self-regulating (MCAO-45, mean 33.1 degrees C+/-2.3 degrees C) for the first 4 hours after anesthesia (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward similar differences in temperatures for MCAO-30-REG and MCAO-30 (P=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, a greater improvement in behavior score was observed for MCAO-45 and MCAO-30 compared with MCAO-45-REG and MCAO-30-REG (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histological score confirmed reduced injury in unregulated temperature groups (MCAO-45-REG mean 38+/-10 and MCAO-45 30+/-5.1, P&lt;0.05; MCAO-30-REG 41+/-10 and MCAO-30 30+/-9, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> is an important confounder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury in the intraluminal filament mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies must use strict temperature regulation </plain></SENT>
