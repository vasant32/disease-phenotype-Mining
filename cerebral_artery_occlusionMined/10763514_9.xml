<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stainings for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and caspase-3, and histochemical staining for a terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling method (TUNEL) were examined in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi> was strongly induced in neurons of the ischemic penumbra from 3 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and caspase-3 began to be induced in the same area from 3 h with a peak at 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cells in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area became TUNEL positive at delayed time, reaching a peak at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the peak of induction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> preceded that of caspase-3, and these two peaks were also precedence of the peak of DNA-fragmentation </plain></SENT>
