<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of PBN on the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36062">3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (3,4-DHBA) as a measure of OH radical formation, during and following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats, subjected to 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> followed by 3 h of recirculation, were injected with either vehicle or PBN (100 mg kg-1 i.p.) prior to MCAO or immediately after recirculation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vivo microdialysis technique was used to collect samples for analysis of 3,4-DHBA by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal levels of 3,4-DHBA were 56-77 nmol L-1 in the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, the formation of 3,4-DHBA decreased by about 50% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon recirculation, a 3-fold rise in 3,4-DHBA formation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2 h of recirculation the mean value of 3,4-DHBA in the pretreated, vehicle-injected animals was 125 +/- 18 nmol L-1 and in the PBN-injected 145 +/- 48 nmol L-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the animals were treated after MCAO either with vehicle or PBN the values at 2 h recirculation were 155 +/- 148 and 189 +/- 145 nmol L-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference between vehicle- and PBN-injected groups was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that during reperfusion following MCAO, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> formation increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase is not ameliorated by PBN which suggests that PBN does not protect the brain by a general scavenging of OH radicals, although tissue specific actions cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
