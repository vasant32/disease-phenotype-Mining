<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here Fos-LI in the hypothalamic, medullary and thoracic spinal cord neurons some of them are believed to be involved in cardiovascular regulation after the cerebral ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 2 h, especially in the latter after right sided <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, Fos-LI confined to the cell nucleus, was detected bilaterally in cells of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the area postrema and ventrolateral medulla (VLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A few Fos-like immunoreactive neurons were observed in the nucleus raphe pallidus and obscurus, and in the intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the corresponding areas in sham-operated animals, Fos-like immunoreactive neurons were sparsely distributed or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colocalization study showed that a variable number of the Fos-like immunoreactive neurons in NTS and VLM coexpressed tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such double labelled neurons appeared to be more common in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the induction of Fos-LI in neurons of the hypothalamus, medulla and thoracic spinal cord was linked to cardiovascular regulation following the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
