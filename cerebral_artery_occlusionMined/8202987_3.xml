<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four intravenous treatment categories: a bolus of 100 mg/kg MDL-100,453 followed by a saline infusion for 24 hours, isotonic saline as a bolus and 100 mg/kg per 24 hours of MDL-100,453 as an infusion over 24 hours, active drug in the bolus and 24-hour infusion, and control treatment of an isotonic saline bolus and infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the intraluminal suture, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug infusion was accomplished by an osmotic minipump implanted under the skin and attached to the jugular vein, which delivered drug or vehicle over a period of 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining after 24 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume of animals that received the MDL-100,453 bolus injection followed by MDL-100,453 infusion was significantly smaller than that of controls (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant effect of infusion on the reduction of extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was also demonstrated (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a statistically significant inverse correlation was demonstrated between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and blood levels of MDL-100,453 at 60 minutes and 120 minutes after injection (r = -.33 and r = -.49, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant neuroprotective effect of MDL-100,453 when treatment was initiated 30 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> began and was maintained for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
