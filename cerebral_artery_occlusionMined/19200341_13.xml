<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that a short ischemic event (ischemic preconditioning, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) results in a subsequent resistance to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (ischemic tolerance, IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated the role of innate immunity and in particular of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several evidences suggest that TLR4 might also be involved in IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have now used an in vivo model of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> to investigate whether TLR4 is involved in IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 6-min temporary bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> was used for focal <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and it was performed on TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/10ScNJ) and animals that express TLR4 normally (C57BL/10ScSn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the ability of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> to induce IT, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed 48 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> outcome was evaluated by determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and assessment of neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> caused neuroprotection as shown by a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and better outcome in mice expressing TLR4 normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TLR4-deficient mice showed less <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) showed an up-regulation in the expression of these proteins in both substrains of mice measured 18, 24 and 48 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, being higher in mice with TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was observed 18, 24 and 48 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, being more intense in TLR4-expressing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that TLR4 signalling is involved in brain tolerance as shown by the difference in the percentage of neuroprotection produced by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> between ScSn and ScNJ (60% vs. 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The higher expression of TNF-alpha, iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-kappaB activation in mice expressing TLR4 is likely to participate in this endogenous neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
