<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN: A controlled laboratory study in animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PROCEDURE: NSCs were cultured with (CE) or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> 17Î²-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) and transplanted into the lateral ventricles of rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A MCAO model alone group and treatment control group served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: Transplantation recipients (CN and CE groups) had ameliorated neurological deficits, less severe morphological changes and reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, while there were no significant differences in these outcomes or in nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression between the CN and CE groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 1 post-transplantation, the CE group exhibited significantly higher neuron-specific enolase expression compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups, but there were no significant differences between the CE group and CN groups on days 4 and 7 post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated no measurable improvements of E2 pre-treatment NSCs in neuronal survival, migration or neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings provide pre-clinical support for the use of NSC transplantation in ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
