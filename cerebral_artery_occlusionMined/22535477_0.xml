<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0008770'>low survival rates</z:mp> and potential tumorigenicity of implanted cells could undermine the efficacy of the cell-based treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of stem cell-conditioned medium (CM) may be a feasible approach to overcome these limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Especially, specific stem cell culture condition and continuous infusion of CM into ischemic brains would have better therapeutic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CM was prepared by culturing human adipose-derived stem cells in a three-dimensional spheroid form to increase the secretion of angiogenic/neuroprotective factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by standard middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> methods in the brain of 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous infusion of CM or αMEM media (0.5 μl/hr) into the lateral ventricle was initiated 8 days after the surgery and maintained for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alteration in the motor function was monitored by the rotarod test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume and the number of microvessels or TUNEL-positive neural cells were analyzed 15 days after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with αMEM, continuous CM infusion reduced the infarction volume and maintained motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of CD31-positive microvessels and TUNEL-positive neural cells significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the penumbra regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neural cell types decreased, reduction in the microglial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> was prominent and significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, the therapeutic effects of the CM against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were confirmed in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Increased endothelial cell proliferation, reduced neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and milder <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> may play important roles in the treatment effects of CM </plain></SENT>
