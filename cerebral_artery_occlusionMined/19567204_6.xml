<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation on the recovery of neurological functions in rat's MCAO (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) model and its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female adult SD rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups: sham-operated group, MCAO group, vehicle group and MCAO + MSCs-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSCs were injected into the lateral ventricle of rats in the MSCs-treated group and the same volume of PBS was given to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-10 and TNF-alpha were assayed by RT-PCR and ELISA detections at day 1 and 4 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume was measured by TTC-staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats underwent behavioral tests before, as well as 1, 4, and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSCs significantly improved functional recovery compared with the control at day 14 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the MCAO group and the vehicle group, the expression of IL-10 mRNA and its protein level in the MSCs group significantly upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of TNF-alpha at day 4 after MCAO in the MSCs group significantly decreased compared with that of the MCAO group and the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, transplantation with MSCs significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at day 1 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study strongly suggested transplantation with MSCs could reduce neuronal injury post focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats partly by regulating the expressions of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in the brain </plain></SENT>
