<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the neuroprotective effects of NT-3 expression controlled by 5HRE after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we constructed a recombinant retrovirus vector (RV) with five copies of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-responsive elements (5HRE or 5H) and NT-3 and delivered it to the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of rats received RV-5H-NT3, RV-5H-EGFP or saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three days after gene transfer, the rats underwent 90min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO), followed by 1-28days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days after tMCAO, brain NT-3 expression was significantly increased in the RV-5H-NT3-transduced animals compared with the RV-5H-EGFP or saline group, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was smaller in the RV-5H-NT3-transduced group than the RV-5H-EGFP or saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced in RV-5H-NT3-transduced brains compared with the RV-5H-EGFP or saline group 3 and 7days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the neurological status of RV-5H-NT3-transduced rats was better than that of RV-5H-EGFP- or saline-transduced animals from 1day to 4weeks after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that 5HRE could modulate NT-3 expression in the ischemic brain environment and that the up-regulated NT-3 could effectively improve neurological status following tMCAO due to decreased initial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To avoid unexpected side effects, 5HRE-controlled gene expression might be a useful tool for gene therapy of ischemic disorders in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
