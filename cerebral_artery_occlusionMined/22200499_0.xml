<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> exerts a neuroprotective effect through the activation of Akt and its downstream targets, Bad and 14-3-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were immediately treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (100mg/kg, i.v.) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24h after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume during MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> attenuated the MCAO injury-induced decrease of phospho-PDK1, phospho-Akt and phospho-Bad levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> did not affect the expression of 14-3-3 and Bcl-xL, which exerts an anti-apoptotic effect through interaction with phospho-Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the interaction between phospho-Bad and 14-3-3 decreased during MCAO, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decrease in these interaction levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> attenuates cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during MCAO and that these protective effects are due to inhibition of Akt signaling pathway inactivation and maintenance of the interaction between phospho-Bad and 14-3-3 </plain></SENT>
