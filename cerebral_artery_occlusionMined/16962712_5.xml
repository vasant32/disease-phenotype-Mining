<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DCX expression is increased in subventricular zone (SVZ) cells migrating to the boundary of an ischemic lesion after induction of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in adult rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that DCX, in addition to being a marker of migrating neuroblasts, serves to protect neuroblasts from conditions of stress, such as oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using gene transfer technology, we overexpressed DCX in rat SVZ and U-87 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells remained viable against severe OGD, up to 32 h exhibiting 1% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> compared with 100% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these genetically modified cells upregulated expression of E-, VE- and N-cadherin, molecules that promote endothelial survival signals via the VE-cadherin/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT/beta-catenin pathway and inactivate the proapoptotic factor Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DCX overexpression also significantly increased cell migration in SVZ tissue explants and U-87 cells and significantly upregulated microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) and nestin protein levels in SVZ and U-87 cells compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knocking down DCX expression in DCX overexpressing SVZ and U-87 cells with DCX small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA), confirmed the specificity of DCX on cell survival against OGD, and the DCX induced upregulation of E-, VE- and N-cadherin, MAP2 and nestin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In NIH3T3 cells, DCX overexpression had no effect on cell survival against OGD, and indicating that the protective effects of DCX was restricted to brain cells e.g. SVZ and U-87 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a novel and an important role for DCX as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agent</z:chebi> for migrating neuroblasts and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
