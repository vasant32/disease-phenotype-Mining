<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of PACAP treatment, and endogenous PACAP deficiency, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological function, and the cerebrocortical transcriptional response in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PACAP-38 administered i.v. or i.c.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1 h after MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and ameliorated functional motor deficits measured 24 h later in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological deficits (walking faults) were both greater in PACAP-deficient than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, but treatment with PACAP reduced lesion volume and neurological deficits in PACAP-deficient mice to the same level of improvement as in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 35,546-clone mouse cDNA microarray was used to investigate cortical transcriptional changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and PACAP-deficient mice, and with PACAP treatment after MCAO in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>229 known (named) transcripts were increased (228) or decreased (1) in abundance at least 50% following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>49 transcripts were significantly up-regulated only at 1 h post-MCAO (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> response transcripts), 142 were up-regulated only at 24 h post-MCAO (delayed response transcripts) and 37 transcripts were up-regulated at both times (sustained response transcripts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than half of these are transcripts not previously reported to be altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger percentage of genes up-regulated at 24 hr than at 1 hr required endogenous PACAP, suggesting a more prominent role for PACAP in later response to injury than in the initial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a neuroprotective role for PACAP in late response to injury, i.e., even when administered 1 hr or more after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Putative injury effector transcripts regulated by PACAP include beta-actin, midline 2, and metallothionein 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Potential neuroprotective transcripts include several demonstrated to be PACAP-regulated in other contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prominent among these were transcripts encoding the PACAP-regulated gene Ier3, and the neuropeptides enkephalin, substance P (tachykinin 1), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
