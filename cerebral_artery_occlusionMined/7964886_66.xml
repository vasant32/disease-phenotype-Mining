<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the temporal profile of ischemic tissue damage, neutrophil response, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> after permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by advancing a nylon monofilament to occlude middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of rats were investigated: (1) those with permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 29), and (2) and those having the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> released after 2 h (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the cortical lesion was smaller in rats subjected to transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion than in rats subjected to permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surface area of the lesion was identical in both groups at 48 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration into tissue and the time of peak neutrophil infiltration occurred earlier after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion than after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (6 h, 48 h in transient; 12 h, 72 h in permanent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the lesions, the number of occluded vessels was significantly lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> group than in the permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group during the time interval between 12-48 h (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the temporal evolution of the lesion, the pattern of neutrophil infiltration and the chronology of microvascular occlusion differs depending on whether the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is transient (2 h) or permanent; however, significant differences in the size of the brain lesion disappeared 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
