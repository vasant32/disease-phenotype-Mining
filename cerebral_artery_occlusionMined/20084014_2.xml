<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the C-terminal region of connexin43 isimportant for channel activity, we carried out MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> experiments in mice expressing a truncated form of connexin43 (Cx43DeltaCT mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain sections were analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>, and inflammatory cell invasion 4 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult cortices and astrocyte cultures were examined for connexin43 (Cx43) expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured astrocytes were also examined for dye coupling, channel conductance, hemichannel activity, and Ca wave propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cx43DeltaCT mice exhibit enhanced cerebral injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>Astrogliosis</z:mp> was reduced and inflammatory cell invasion was increased inthe peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region in these mice compared with controls; Cx43 expression was also altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, cultured astrocytes from Cx43DeltaCT mice were less coupled and displayed alterations in channel gating, hemichannel activity, and Ca wave properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that astrocytic Cx43 contributed to the regulation of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and support the view that the Cx43 C-terminal region is important in protection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
