<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cornel iridoid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> (CIG), an ingredient extracted from a traditional Chinese herb Cornus officinalis, on neurological function and neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIG was intragastrically administered to rats in doses of 20, 60 and 180 mg/kg/day, starting 3 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavioral test was performed by using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 7, 14, or 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> were detected by using immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor Flk-1 was measured by RT-PCR, and the protein expression of VEGF was determined by Western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment with CIG at the doses of 60 and 180 mg/kg/day significantly improved neurological function, and increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells and nestin-positive cells in the subventricular zone of rats 7, 14 and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of newly mature neurons and blood vessels in striatum, as indicated by BrdU/NeuN and vWF immunoreactivity, respectively, was also increased in CIG-treated rats 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CIG treatment obviously enhanced the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 and the protein expression of VEGF 7 and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that CIG promoted neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and improved neurological function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats, and the mechanism might be related to CIG's increasing VEGF and Flk-1 in the brain </plain></SENT>
