<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well established that variations in cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and hemodynamics can influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in different inbred mouse lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development in C57Bl/6 and Sv/129 mice in the widely used model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) by multimodal ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).C57Bl/6 and Sv/129 mice underwent 60 min of tMCAO and were analyzed by MRI 2 h and 24 h afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural and functional images were registered to a standard anatomical template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probability maps of infarction were rendered by automated segmentation from quantitative T2-relaxometric images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-brain segmentation of infarction was accomplished manually on high-resolution T2-weighted (T2-w) RARE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion (cerebral blood flow, CBF) was measured quantitatively by modified continuous arterial-spin-labeling (CASL) and apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) by spin-echo diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).Probabilities of cortical (95.1% +/- 3.1 vs. 92.1% +/- 2.5; p &gt; 0.05) and subcortical (100% vs. 100%; p &gt; 0.05) infarctions at 24 h were similar in both groups as was the whole-brain volumetric extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, CBF and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values did not differ between C57Bl/6 and Sv/129 mice at any time point or region of interest.The C57Bl/6 and Sv/129 genetic background is no major confounding factor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and cerebral perfusion in the tMCAO model </plain></SENT>
