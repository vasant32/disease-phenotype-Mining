<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There have been a number of recent reports describing the relationship between ischemic damage and various behavioral and functional measures, although there have been few studies that have demonstrated a direct correlation between functional impairment and lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess functional outcome by measurement of motor impairment and to determine whether this correlated to a range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes induced by varying the duration of focal ischemic insult in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 0, 30, 60, of 120 minutes or permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor impairment was assessed by the accelerating rota-rod and grid-walking tests, and the brains were perfusion-fixed for histological determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked impairment in performance of both motor tests was recorded in the 60-minute, 120-minute, and the permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion groups when compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between regional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> behavioral measurements (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r2 &gt; .5, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rota-rod and grid-walking tests of motor performance provide quantitative, objective, and reproducible measures of functional impairment of rats following an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These impairments correlate directly with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and provide information integral to future studies evaluating the effects of potential neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
