<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice were left untreated, or received NGP1-01 (20 mg/kg per dose intraperitoneally), memantine (20 mg/kg per dose intraperitoneally), or vehicle (DMSO) at 15 min, 24 h and 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor function was tested daily for two weeks using the "corner test", a proven paradigm for the assessment of functional integrity in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NGP1-01 significantly reduced sensorimotor deficits over the 2-week period (p&lt;0.001, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although memantine was less effective than NGP1-01 (p&lt;0.05), it still significantly attenuated sensorimotor deficits in the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate study, brain damage 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was determined histologically in mice receiving no treatment, DMSO, or NGP1-01 (dosages and dosage schedule same as above) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial brain sections were stained for nonviable neurons with Fluoro-Jade B and the volume of damaged tissue was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGP1-01 treated mice had a significantly lower volume of brain damage (13+/-7 mm(3), p&lt;0.01) than both control groups (no treatment: 47+/-4 mm(3), DMSO: 50+/-10 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, at weight-equivalent doses, NGP1-01 was at least as neuroprotective as the established <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be a promising lead structure for the development of novel multiple-action drugs in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> with an excitotoxic component </plain></SENT>
