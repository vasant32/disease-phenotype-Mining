<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuroprotection is feasible without cerebral blood flow augmentation in experimental permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by the suture occlusion method and were treated 1 hour thereafter with a single 5-minute intravenous infusion of the postsynaptic density-95 protein inhibitor Tat-NR2B9c (7.5 mg/kg) or saline (n=8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial spin-labeled perfusion-weighted MRI and diffusion weighted MRI were obtained with a 4.7-T Bruker system at 30, 45, 70, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes postmiddle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to determine cerebral blood flow and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, animals were neurologically scored (0 to 5), euthanized, and the brains stained with 2-3-5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to ascertain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the effects of Tat-NR2B9c on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> levels were measured in vitro in neurons subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was decreased by 30.3% in the Tat-NR2B9c-treated animals compared with controls (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in 24 hours neurological scores in the Tat-NR2B9c group compared with controls, 1.8±0.5 and 2.8±1.0, respectively (P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, Tat-NR2B9c significantly attenuated diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth and preserved the diffusion-weighted imaging/perfusion-weighted imaging mismatch (ischemic penumbra) without affecting cerebral blood flow in the ischemic core or penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tat-NR2B9c treatment of primary neuronal cultures resulted in 26% increase in cell viability and 34% greater <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> levels after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> levels in vitro and neuroprotection in permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats is achievable without cerebral blood flow augmentation using a postsynaptic density-95 protein inhibitor </plain></SENT>
