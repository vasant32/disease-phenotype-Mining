<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">Diuretics</z:chebi> and osmotic agents are controversial and poorly defined therapeutic modalities after large infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we tested the hypothesis that significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> occurs in the contralateral uninjured hemisphere and that this postischemic complication can be manipulated by hypertonic saline therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Under controlled conditions of normoxia, normocarbia, and normothermia, rats were subjected to 2 hrs of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adequacy of MCAO and reperfusion was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals except naive rats received continuous infusion of 0.9% saline at 0.5 mL/hr throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested, and tissue water content was estimated by comparing the wet-to-dry weight ratios of ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres at 12 hrs, 24 hrs, or 2, 3, or 7 days postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Naive and sham-operated rats served as control cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a second series of randomized experiments, wet-to-dry weight ratios were determined in rats treated with continuous intravenous infusion of 7.5% hypertonic saline (0.5 mL/hr; <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, 50:50) and were compared with well-studied antiedema therapy: 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (2.5 g/kg bolus every 6 hrs) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> (2.5 mg/kg bolus every 6 hrs) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between sham-operated and naive control cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At 24 hrs of reperfusion, water content was higher in both ipsilateral ischemic (82.80 +/- 0.86%) and contralateral hemispheres (80.53 +/- 0.29%), compared with naive animals (ipsilateral, 79.62 +/- 0.12%; contralateral, 79.53 +/- 0.13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was measured at 2 days in both hemispheres (ipsilateral, 83.94 +/- 0.47%; contralateral, 80.63 +/- 0.13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was present for up to 3 days in contralateral tissue (80.27 +/- 0.26%) and persisted to 7 days in the injured hemisphere (81.07 +/- 0.34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (as assessed at 2 days postocclusion) was robustly attenuated with hypertonic saline therapy (ipsilateral, 81.59 +/- 0.52%; contralateral, 78.44 +/- 0.22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of hypertonic saline was equivalent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> (ipsilateral, 82.09 +/- 0.50%; contralateral, 79.13 +/- 0.17%) but less robust than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (ipsilateral, 79.89 +/- 0.36%; contralateral, 78.73 +/- 0.17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> persists in both injured and contralateral hemispheres for days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The global, maximal increase in brain water is responsive to continuous 7.5% hypertonic saline treatment begun at 24 hrs postischemia and to standard <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi>/osmotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These results may have implications for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> and osmotic therapy in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
