<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of these cells to recover after temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is likely to be one important determinant of the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> and tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have assessed astrocytic function based on the incorporation of radiolabel from 1-14C-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> into glutamine at 1 hour of recirculation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 or 3 hours in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were marked differences in the response between subregions within the tissue subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but the overall pattern of changes was similar after each ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striatum, which forms part of the severely ischemic focal tissue during <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, showed a large (44% to 68%) decrease in glutamine labeling compared with equivalent tissue from the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-glutamine content was not significantly altered in perifocal tissue in the cerebral cortex, which was subjected to more moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical focal tissue also was not significantly affected, but the response was much more variable between rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these brain subregions, the extent of recovery of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> metabolism after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was not a good predictor of the likelihood of subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar pattern of responses persisted when recirculation was extended to 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that many astrocytes, particularly in the cortex, remain viable and capable of at least some complex oxidative metabolism during the first few hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
