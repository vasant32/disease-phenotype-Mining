<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow maps were obtained using arterial spin tagging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the quantitative perfusion measurements in ischemic tissue still pose difficulties, the combined perfusion and diffusion data nevertheless distinguish between a "moderately affected area," with reduced perfusion but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diffusion; and a "severely affected area," in which both perfusion and diffusion are significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two novel magnetic resonance imaging observations are reported, namely, a decrease in T2 and an increase in T1, both within the first few minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rapid initial decrease in T2 is believed to be associated with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, while the initial increase in T1 may be related to several factors, such as flow effects, an alteration in tissue oxygenation, and changes in water environment </plain></SENT>
