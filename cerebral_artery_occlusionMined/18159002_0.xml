<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight rats were randomized into 3 groups, namely the sham operated group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) group, and I/R following hypoxic preconditioning group (HP+I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter two groups, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MACO) for 3 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h to induce cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory ability of the rats 24 h after reperfusion was assessed using Y-maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify the expressions of survivin and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 proteins in the rat brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of survivin- and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70-positive cells in the brain tissues was significantly different between HP+I/R group and IR and the sham operated groups (P&lt;0.05), and following I/R injury, the rats in HP+I/R group showed much better performance in the Y-maze test than those in I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypoxic preconditioning can protect the ischemic brain against reperfusion injury, promote recovery of the learning and memory ability and neurological functions following the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of the expressions of survivin and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 proteins might be one of the molecular mechanisms for this neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
