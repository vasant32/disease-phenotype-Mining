<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used rats whose brains were transfected to over-express human PEDF in order to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of PEDF following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the human PEDF gene (Ad.PEDF) or E. colibeta-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) was directly injected into the right striatum at 7 days prior to 70 min of MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degeneration of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes caused by MCAO were attenuated by over-expression of PEDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS) and water channel aquaporin 4 after MCAO was significantly reduced in Ad.PEDF-injected striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results from this study provide the first in vivo evidence that PEDF is effective in protecting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> neurons from ischemic insult, suggesting that PEDF may have a role as an endogenous neuroprotectant in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
