<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) is a protein located in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> plasma membrane of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>-system endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of EBA as a quantitative marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelium and characterized alterations of EBA immunohistochemistry following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesesthetized, non-ischemic control rats (N=6) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other animals (N=5) received 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by 3-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were prepared by perfusion-fixation and paraffin-embedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For EBA immunohistochemistry, a monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjacent sections were reacted for activated microglia by isolectin immunochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphometric image-analysis was carried out in standardized microscopic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control brains, pial and parenchymal blood vessels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes were distinctly and selectively immunolabeled for EBA; background staining was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EBA-positive vascular profiles occupied 4.3+/-0.36% (mean+/-S.D.) of the microscopic field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean area of each identified profile was 51+/-13 micromter(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low coefficients of variation for both numbers of profiles (17%) and fractional areas (8%) denoted high inter-animal consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In brains with prior MCAo, numbers of EBA-immunoreactive vascular profiles in infarcted cortex and striatum were reduced by 39 and 46%, respectively, and their fractional areas were decreased by 63 and 76%, respectively, compared to contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Activated microglia were prominent in zones of frank infarction and in adjacent paramedian cortex; the latter region, however, showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing EBA-immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>EBA-immunohistochemistry provides a sensitive and specific index of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrovascular endothelial structures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The technique lends itself well to quantitative morphometry and is applicable to perfusion-fixed paraffin-embedded material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>EBA immunoreactivity declines in zones of ischemic infarction </plain></SENT>
