<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the effect of aged garlic extract (AGE), establish the therapeutic window, and determine its protective mechanism in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h and treated with 1.2ml/kg body wt.(i.p.) of AGE 30min before, at the beginning of (0R), or 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 0R treatment significantly reduced the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area after 2h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated doses subsequent to the 0R treatment (at 1, 2, or 3h after reperfusion) had no effect on the temporal window of protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective 0R treatment with AGE prevented the increase in nitrotyrosine and the decrease in total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, and extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activities induced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that AGE delays the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this treatment itself was not associated with a noticeable improvement in the neurological outcome, or with an effect on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the neuroprotective effect of AGE in the 0R treatment might be associated with control of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> burst induced by reperfusion, preservation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity, and the delay of other pathophysiological processes </plain></SENT>
