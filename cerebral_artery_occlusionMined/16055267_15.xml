<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, restoration of blood flow under certain conditions may also cause delayed neuronal damage (reperfusion injury) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interrelationship of changes in T1, T2 and diffusion weighted images of tissue water were studied in mouse models of permanent and transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sham surgery or either permanent or transient (30 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were induced in 14 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images of the brain were acquired including: T2 maps, T1 maps and diffusion weighted spin-echo images to produce apparent diffusion coefficient of water apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were collected on average 90 min after MCAO in both the transient and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scans were repeated at 24h post-occlusion in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO resulted in decreases in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and no significant change in T2 acutely following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were increases in T1 compared to sham controls within the ischemic region in mice following either transient or permanent MCAO (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to permanent MCAO, there were increases in T2 (P&lt;0.001) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area present in the reperfusion phase within 90 min of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was considerable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth at 24h (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that following either type of occlusion there are early increases in T1 suggesting an elevated water content in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion, while only following transient MCAO are there early increases in T2, indicative of early vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
