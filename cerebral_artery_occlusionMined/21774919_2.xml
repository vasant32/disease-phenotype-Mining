<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously we have found that extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi>) has neuroprotective properties in in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, extracellular <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> significantly increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere within 2h following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats, and remained elevated for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> could be a potential candidate for a non-toxic neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> on rats following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also determined whether <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> can precondition neurons by modulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As most therapies employ a combination treatment regimen, we optimized the neuroprotection by combining pre- and post-MCAO treatments with <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi>, attempting to reduce both ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and improve functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combination of 4mg/kg <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> given 30min pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 8mg/kg <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> given 3, 24 and 48h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> exerted the most significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and sustainable improvement in neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these effects are not attributable to <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements taken 6h post-MCAO from animals pre-treated with <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> did not reveal any significant changes in ER stress proteins (GRP 78 and 94) or <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 70, but did reveal significantly increased levels of m-calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data indicate that there is a treatment regimen for <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> as a neuroprotectant following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> confers neuroprotection may involve an increase in m-calpain, possibly resulting from a mild increase in intracellular calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>M-calpain may be involved in the preconditioning response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by upregulating endogenous pro-survival mechanisms in neurons </plain></SENT>
