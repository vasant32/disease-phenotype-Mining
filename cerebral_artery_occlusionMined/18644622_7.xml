<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cocaine and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide that protects brains against ischemic injury in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> against CART(CARTi), this study shows that CART knockdown by CARTi downregulated exogenous and endogenous CART <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, CART knockdown exacerbated neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also showed that CART knockdown increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CART's protective effects are most likely mediated through the ERK 1/2 pathway, since ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, not that of p38 or JNK is activated in CART-treated neurons after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, neuroprotection of CART is abolished by CART knockdown and by pretreatment with ERK <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> PD98059 and U0126, but not with p38 or JNK <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> SB203580 or SP600125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence that CART is an endogenous neuroprotective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and it does so through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CART may be developed into a therapeutic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related brain injury </plain></SENT>
