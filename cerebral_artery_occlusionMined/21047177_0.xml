<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterization of cytokine expression to the early damaged tissue might aid in further understanding of lesion development and contribute to definition of molecular targets for selective immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial monocyte-activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> II (EMAPII) is a proinflammatory, antiangiogenic cytokine whose expression following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the spatiotemporal expression of EMAPII in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unilateral transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 hr followed by different reperfusion periods using male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, rats were sacrificed on Day 1, 3, 5, or 7 following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMAPII expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EMAPII-positive cell accumulation was observed as early as Day 1 postreperfusion and increased steadily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant accumulation of EMAPII-positive cells was seen in lesion and penumbra areas but not in the translateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both amoeboid and ramified EMAPII-positive cells were observed and mainly localized to lesion and penumbra areas, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The known pathological functions together with abundant cellular accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> lesions suggest that EMAPII might contribute to pathophysiological consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
