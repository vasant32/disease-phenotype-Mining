<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test is less time consuming than the original protocol by virtue of requiring minimal pre-training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a detailed protocol describing how to conduct the modified adhesive removal (sticky-tape) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) using an intraluminal filament, animals undergo the modified sticky-tape test (MST) on post-operative days 1, 3, 7 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the test, a non-removable tape sleeve is placed around the animal's paw and the time to remove the stimulus is measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time spent attending to this stimulus is also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals undergoing MST for the first time demonstrate nearly-uniform excellent performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, following rMCAo, the ratio of left to right performance on the MST is significantly different at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In short, the MST accurately assesses neurological dysfunction in rodents, not only with minimal pre-training, but also with accurate localization to the side of injury </plain></SENT>
