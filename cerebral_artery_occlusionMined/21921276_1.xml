<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress on endothelial function and ischemic brain injury in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 129/SV mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50692">mifepristone</z:chebi> (25 mg kg(-1)/d) or vehicle and exposed to 28 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress consisting of exposure to rat, restraint stress, and tail suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and blood pressure were continuously recorded by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression as well as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923,35924">hydroperoxides</z:chebi> were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was measured in aortic rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was quantified after 30 minutes filamentous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 72 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> stress caused a significant increase in heart rate, impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, and reduced aortic and brain endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress showed major increases in ischemic lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These deleterious effects of stress were completely reversed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50692">mifepristone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> stress increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> vulnerability likely through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, which can be reversed by a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
