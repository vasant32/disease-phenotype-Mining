<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for c-fos, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), TrkB, and TrkC were studied using in situ hybridization in the rat brain at different reperfusion times after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term (15 min) MCAO, which does not cause neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, induced elevated BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression confined to ipsilateral frontal and cingulate cortices outside the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a longer duration of MCAO (2 h), which leads to cortical infarction, the increase was more marked and elevated BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were also detected bilaterally in dentate granule cells and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum expression was found after 2 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 h BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression had returned to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core of the parietal cortex only scattered neurons were expressing high levels of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after 15 min and 2 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of different BDNF transcripts showed that MCAO induced a marked increase of exon III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but only small increases of exon I and II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, elevated expression of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in the entire ipsilateral cerebral cortex, including the ischemic core, after both 15 min and 2 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two hours of MCAO also induced transient, bilateral increases of NGF and TrkB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and a decrease of NT-3 mRNA expression, confined to dentate granule cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in cortical neurons after MCAO is probably triggered by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> through a spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of response of the BDNF gene in the ischemic core may be due to suppression of signal transduction or transcription factor synthesis caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observed pattern of gene expression after MCAO agrees well with a neuroprotective role of BDNF in cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, elevated levels of NGF and BDNF protein could also increase synaptic efficacy in the postischemic phase, which may promote epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
