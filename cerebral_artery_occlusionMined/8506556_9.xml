<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to cellular (eg, polymorphonuclear leukocyte) contributors to the focal "no-reflow" phenomenon, activation of coagulation may also play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have tested a potential role of tissue factor-mediated coagulation in the microvascular perfusion defects seen after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion in a baboon model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the murine anti-tissue factor monoclonal antibody TF9-6B4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor is the principal resident procoagulant substance in cerebral tissues and has a distinct perivascular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microvascular patency in the basal ganglia after 3-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 1-hour reperfusion was quantified by computerized video imaging of carbon-tracer perfused tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomized to receive intravenous TF9-6B4 (10 mg/kg) 10 minutes before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 6) or no treatment (n = 6) in an open study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control animals, a significant decrease in patency was confirmed in microvessels less than 30 microns in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion of TF9-6B4 before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced a stable maximal level of circulating antibody within 10 minutes, which lasted the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in reflow in microvessels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> size classes occurred after TF9-6B4 infusion, which was significant in those 7.5 to 30 microns (P = .038) and 30 to 50 microns (P = .013) in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that tissue factor-mediated events may also contribute to no-reflow in noncapillary microvessels after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
