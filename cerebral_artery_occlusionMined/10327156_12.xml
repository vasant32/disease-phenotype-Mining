<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined a protective effect of anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody against rat ischemic brain injury with 24 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-rat P-selectin monoclonal antibody, was intravenously injected at a dose of 1 mg/kg at 5 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control animals received the same volume of vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO was accomplished by an insertion of nylon thread with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> coating for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of anti-P-selectin antibody significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and brain water content at 24 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> was not normally detected, it became remarkably evident at 1 day of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with ARP 2-4 significantly reduced the number of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that administration of monoclonal antibody against P-selectin attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, which was associated with reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
