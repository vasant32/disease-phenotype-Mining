<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SHR-SP, SHR, Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and C57BJ/6 mice were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was conducted to evaluate the number of NG2(+) cells in frozen brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>Demyelination</z:hpo> was evaluated by Sudan black staining and serum level of myelin basic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed to prepare experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of NG2(+) cells was significantly decreased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and increased in penumbra in WKY rats after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In brain sections of 6-month-old SHR-SP, the number of NG2(+) cells was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) less than that in age-matched SHR and WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this phenomenon was not observed in 3-month-old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>Demyelination</z:hpo> was found in 6-month-old SHR-SP but not in 3-month-old SHR-SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment of cuprizone in mice induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and enlargement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The decline of NG2(+) cells may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and contribute to the susceptibility of SHR-SP to ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
