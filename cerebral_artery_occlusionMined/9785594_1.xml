<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of pretreatment with ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on cerebral blood flow in a model of photothrombotic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured by iodoantipyrine autoradiography 30 minutes after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a novel image-alignment algorithm, 3-dimensional reconstructions of averaged cerebral blood flow were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference-image of local cerebral blood flow between ritanserin and vehicle-treated animals revealed a subcortical zone underlying the ischemic cortex where cerebral blood flow was markedly enhanced indicating a beneficial hemodynamic effect of ritanserin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional image analysis provides a powerful tool to detect inter-group differences of cerebral blood flow which are underestimated by conventional types of data analysis </plain></SENT>
