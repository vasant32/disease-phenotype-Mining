<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GV150526 is a novel glycine site <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a potent neuroprotective agent in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> at the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> ligand binding site, GV150526 appears to be free of hemodynamic and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of loading and maintenance infusions of GV150526 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, ascending-dose study conducted in 2 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In part A of the study, loading doses of 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In part B, the maximum loading dose from part A was followed by maintenance infusions (5 infusions at 12-hour intervals), aiming to maintain neuroprotective levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Safety data were collected throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study was not designed to test efficacy, but outcome data (Barthel Index and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were recruited to the study over 11 months; 18 patients received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GV150526 was well tolerated by the 48 patients who received it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no excess of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or hemodynamic adverse events compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minor abnormalities in liver function tests were observed in association with the higher maintenance doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of 7 patients receiving the 800-mg loading dose followed by 400 mg BID and 1 of 6 patients who received the 200-mg BID maintenance dose showed a small rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and 3 patients had increases in transaminases; the mean values at 72 hours remained under twice the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These changes were asymptomatic and resolved within 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GV150526 is an emerging neuroprotective agent, with no apparent significant central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or hemodynamic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting effects appear to be restricted to mild transient and asymptomatic rises in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and/or transaminases, primarily observed at high maintenance doses, and there were no findings that should preclude further clinical development </plain></SENT>
