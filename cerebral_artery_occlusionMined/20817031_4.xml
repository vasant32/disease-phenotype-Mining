<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> represent an important contribution to both our understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism and the development of new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique of MCAO (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) via ECA (external carotid artery) occlusion is widely utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the ECA and its branches leads to impaired mastication and oral intake, post-surgical body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and poor neurological recovery which can possibly confound one's interpretation of rats' neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we developed a novel modified technique for MCAO without ligation or coagulation of the ECA and its branches using an approach via the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our modified technique, we perform an additional fixation of the filament in the ICA which improves the stability of the model and increases the homogeneity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the original MCAO technique via the ECA, our modified technique via the ICA demonstrated decreased variability in the percent infarcted volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, as well as a decreased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we observed that with our modified technique, rats gained more weight after surgery and there was less initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after the surgical preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our new approach may serve as an effective model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and may lead to a better understanding of stoke pathophysiology and to the future development of new drugs and other neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
