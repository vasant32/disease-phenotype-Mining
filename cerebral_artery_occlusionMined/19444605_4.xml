<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) technology to study proteomic profile at 6, 12, and 24 h after photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion with or without YAG laser-induced reperfusion in adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 protein peaks that differed from the sham-operation group with a criterion (no overlap of peak intensities between the two groups), 36 peaks (84%) were down-regulated, and seven were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> increased peaks showed greater than twofold increases (up to 8.1 fold) compared with those in the sham-operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of reperfusion were observed mainly at 24 h after 1 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion only in the penumbra, where 23 of 32 peaks returned toward the control values, whereas none of 33 peaks showed such attenuation in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that dynamic changes of protein profile were associated with progression and recovery of the ischemic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
