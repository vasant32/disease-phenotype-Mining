<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that the Smilacis chinae rhizome (SCR) markedly inhibits amyloid beta protein (25-35)-induced neuronal cell damage in cultured rat cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to further verify the neuroprotective effect of SCR on excitotoxic and cerebral ischemic injury using both in vitro and in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cultured cortical neurons to 1 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) for 12 h induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SCR (10 and 50 microg/ml) inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, SCR prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 3-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly reduced in rats that received SCR (30 and 50 mg/kg, orally), with a corresponding improvement in neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SCR treatment significantly decreased the histological changes observed following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oxyresveratrol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> isolated from SCR also inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and ROS generation in cultured cortical neurons, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of SCR may be attributable to these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of SCR against focal cerebral ischemic injury is due to its anti-excitotoxic effects and that SCR may have a therapeutic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
