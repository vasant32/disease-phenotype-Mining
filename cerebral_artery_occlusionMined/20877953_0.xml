<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and its effect on the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> was induced in 52 male Wistar rats by introduction of a 3-0 nylon suture into the middle cerebral artery for either 90 (n=28) or 120 (n=24) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury volume was determined by TTC staining, digital photography and analysis with the Image J software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis employed Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The groups were similar in terms of weight (p=0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of thread inserted was 14.7 mm in the 90 min group and 20.2 mm in the 120 min group (p=0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury was detected in 11 animals (39%) after 90 min and 11 (45%) after 120 min (p=0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals exhibiting injury, filament length was 16.1 ± 11 mm (90 min) vs. 21.9 ± 7.4 mm (120 min) (p=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean infarction zone volume was greater after 120 (259.2 mm³) than after 90 min (162.9 mm³) (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit score for the 90 and 120 min groups was 2.0 and 2.4, respectively (p=0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The experimental model induced significant ischemic cerebral injury in both groups </plain></SENT>
