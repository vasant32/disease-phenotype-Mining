<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, known as middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), occurs, neural stem cells are activated to promote their proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which these cells are activated is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we indicate the involvement of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling in neural stem cells in their activity-related proliferation after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found mGluR5 molecules on neural stem cells by using calcium imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected the activation of neural stem cells by adding the mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On a hippocampal slice, the activation of neural stem cells to promote their proliferation was initiated by theta-burst electrical stimulation at the perforant pathway, and this activation was significantly blocked by an mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, 2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-(phenylethynyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16227">pyridine</z:chebi> (MPEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to this, the injection of the blood-brain barrier-permeable mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="14973">pyrazol</z:chebi>-5-yl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi> into live mice promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vivo theta-burst electrical stimulation induced proliferation of neural stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> field recording study showed that the activity of the hippocampal formation was elevated after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed that the mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MPEP significantly blocked the stimulated proliferation of neural stem cells induced by MCAO, by blocking mGluR5 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamates</z:chebi> released by the elevated neural activities after MCAO may trigger mGluR5 signaling in neural stem cells to promote their proliferation </plain></SENT>
