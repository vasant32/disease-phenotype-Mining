<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into model group, ice cap group, systemic cooling group and ICSI group (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 3 hypothermic groups, the target temperature of 33-34 degrees celsius; was achieved and maintained for 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each group, the neurological scores were recorded at 48 h after the reperfusion, and the brains were removed for measuring the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain water contents and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100β and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the ice cap, systemic cooling and ICSI groups <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 27.4% (P&lt;0.05), 47.6% (P&lt;0.01) and 61.6% (P&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The systemic cooling and ICSI groups, but not the ice cap group, had significantly lower brain water contents than the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 hypothermic methods, only ICSI significantly improved the neurological scores (P&lt;0.05) and reduced serum NSE and S100β levels (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Of the 3 hypothermic groups, ICSI has the best neuroprotective effects, and systemic cooling produces better effect than ice cap in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
