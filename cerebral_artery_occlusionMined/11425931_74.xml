<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with intra-arterial administration of bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MSC have characteristics of stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that MSC injected into the internal carotid artery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enter into ischemic brain and improve neurologic recovery was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five adult Wistar rats were subjected to transient (2-hour) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> alone (n = 9), or treated with intracarotid arterial injection of 200 microL phosphate-buffered saline (n = 8) or 2 x 10(6) MSC in 200 microL phosphate-buffered saline (n = 8) 1 day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSC were harvested and isolated from additional adult rats and then cultured and labeled with bromodeoxyuridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to neurologic functional tests (adhesive-removal, modified neurologic severity scores) before and at 1, 7, and 14 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cell-specific proteins of bromodeoxyuridine-reactive MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bromodeoxyuridine-reactive cells ( approximately 21% of 2 x 10(6) injected MSC) distributed throughout the territory of the middle cerebral artery by 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some bromodeoxyuridine-reactive cells expressed proteins characteristic of astrocytes and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rats with intra-arterial transplantation of MSC exhibited improvement on the adhesive-removal test (p &lt; 0.05) and the modified neurologic severity scores (p &lt; 0.05) at 14 days compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MSC injected intra-arterially are localized and directed to the territory of the middle cerebral artery, and these cells foster functional improvement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
