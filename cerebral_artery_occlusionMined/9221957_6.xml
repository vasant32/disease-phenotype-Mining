<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, temporal, spatial and cellular profiles of the expression of such a protein have not been fully studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Change of immunoreactive P-selectin was examined in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in comparison with that of 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP72) which is a well known marker of cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses were performed to ensure the selective detection of immunoreactive P-selectin and HSP72 proteins with each antibody using brain samples before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporal, spatial and cellular changes of immunohistochemical expressions of P-selectin and HSP72 were evaluated with rat brain sections at 2 and 8 h, and 1, 3 and 7 days of reperfusion after 1 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) staining was performed to evaluate brain cell damage at 3 and 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot showed a single band at molecular weights of 140 and 72 kDa for P-selectin and HSP72, respectively, only after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant band was observed without primary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-selectin-like immunoreactivity was not normally present in rat brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it was expressed mainly in the post-capillary venules of the cerebral cortex and caudate in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory with a peak at 8 h to 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression was diminished by 3 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An immunoreactive HSP72 was scarcely present in the cerebral cortex and caudate of the sham control brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the protein was induced in neurons of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The HSP72 induction was gradually intensified from 8 h with peaks at 1 day in the cortex and at 3 days in the caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity decreased by 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Histopathological study with HE staining showed no evident cell damage at 3 and 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that temporal, spatial and cellular differences were present in the expressions of immunoreactive P-selectin and HSP72 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>P-selectin was expressed from an earlier stage of reperfusion in post-capillary venules, and the expression became maximum at the same time both in the cerebral cortex and caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HSP72 induction began later in neurons and reached maximum at a different time between the cortex and caudate </plain></SENT>
