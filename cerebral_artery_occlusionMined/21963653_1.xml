<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T1DM-rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated without or with Niaspan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> rats (WT) were also subjected to MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome, blood-brain-barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage, brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, immunostaining, and rat brain microvascular endothelial cell (RBEC) culture were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to WT-MCAo-rats, T1DM-MCAo-rats did not show an increase lesion volume, but exhibited significantly increased brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and vascular damage as well as decreased functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in T1DM-MCAo-rats significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage, promoted vascular remodeling and improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T1DM-MCAo-rats exhibited significantly increased Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) expression, but decreased Ang1 expression in the ischemic brain compared to WT-MCAo-rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment attenuated Ang2, but increased Ang1 expression in the ischemic brain in T1DM-MCAo-rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro data show that the capillary-like tube formation in the WT-RBECs marginally increased compared to T1DM-RBEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Niaspan and Ang1 treatment significantly increased tube formation compared to non-treatment control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Ang1 attenuated Niacin-induced tube formation in T1DM-RBECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in T1DM-rats promotes vascular remodeling and improves functional outcome </plain></SENT>
