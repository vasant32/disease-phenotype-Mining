<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous data demonstrated that hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), a yellow color pigments extracted from the safflower, was an effective agent against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we demonstrated that HSYA prevented the injury in cultured cerebral cortical neurons induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and increased the cell viability, as shown by the inhibition of both LDH and NO efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, HSYA administered orally 3 d before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has the capacity to reduce cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after 2 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> followed by 24 h reperfusion in rats, and to significantly improve neurological behavior scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean while, treatment with HSYA significantly decreased both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the protection of HSYA results from, at least in part, suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
