<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous doses of up to 1 mg/kg have been well tolerated by healthy young and elderly volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to assess safety and tolerability of 619C89 in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomised within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to receive 619C89 or placebo as an intravenous loading dose, followed by maintenance doses given 8 hourly for 64 h in a double-blind, ascending-dose tolerance study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dosing commenced at 0.5 mg/kg loading plus 0.25 mg/kg/8 h maintenance for the first group and increased in increments of 0.5 mg/kg loading +0.25 mg/kg/8 h maintenance thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety evaluation was continued for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 48 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12 received placebo and 36 received 619C89 in doses up to 2.5 mg/kg loading plus 1.25 mg/kg/8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation was stopped after the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> in 5 of 18 patients who received 2 mg/kg/8 h or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastro-intestinal upset and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> were also possibly drug related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No drug-related effects on cardiovascular function were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 619C89 was associated with significant central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system side-effects at doses of 2 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/8 h or greater as discrete intravenous infusions within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may also cause gastro-intestinal side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Doses below this are well tolerated in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No adverse cardiovascular effects were seen </plain></SENT>
