<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This causes large variability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models that target the middle cerebral artery proximally and confers resistance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in those that target it distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that by combining distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 1h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, we could generate a large lesion that causes a behavioral deficit with low variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that this new distal hypoxic (DH) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> generates a lesion with a volume of 25% of the ipsilateral hemisphere, extends to the motor cortex and causes a behavioral deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also has a very clear border, exceptionally low variability, and can be performed by a single surgeon on up to 30 animals a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, survivability is 100% in young adult animals, the model can be performed on old animals, and therapeutic intervention can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore DH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an excellent complement to existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models and could be used for preclinical studies in C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
