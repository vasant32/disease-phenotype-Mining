<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, undifferentiated iPS cells have high tumorigenicity, and evaluation of the cells fates, especially in pathologic condition model, is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated the effect of ischemic condition to undifferentiated iPS cells fates in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Undifferentiated iPS cells were characterized with immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The iPS cells (5 × 10⁵) were injected into ipsilateral striatum and cortex after 24 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis was performed from 3 to 28 days after cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>iPS cells in ischemic brain formed <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> with higher probability (p &lt; 0.05) and larger volume (p &lt; 0.01) compared with those in intact brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the four transcriptional factors to produce iPS cells, c-Myc, Oct3/4, and Sox2 strongly expressed in iPS-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in ischemic brain (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 (phospho-VEGFR2) were significantly increased in iPS-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the ischemic brain (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the transcriptional factors might increase expression of MMP-9 and activate VEGFR2, promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> formation in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We strongly propose that the safety of iPS cells should be evaluated not only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition, but also in a pathologic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
