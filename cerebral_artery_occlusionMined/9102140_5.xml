<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between tissue and extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> and regional cerebral blood flow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were measured in extracellular fluid obtained by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry and specific gravity, an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, were measured in contralateral (non-ischemic), penumbra and densely ischemic brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> level was found in the penumbra but there was no difference in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> levels between contralateral and densely ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
