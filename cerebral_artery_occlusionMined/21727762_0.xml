<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in the embryo develops around the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis has been also reported in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which is close to CSF, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, CSF extracted following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats was added to bone marrow stromal cell (MSC) culture in vitro, and the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of MSCs were obtained from 7-week-old Lewis rats and incubated in a plastic tissue culture flask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF was retrieved from other rats 48 hrs after 0, 15 and 75 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF from these three groups were added to respective MSC culture solutions, and the cells were then incubated for 72 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (Erk1/2) were obtained just after the CSF induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD34, CD45, CD90 and CD108 were assessed by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of MSCs was accelerated by the addition of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> CSF, especially in the 15-min MCAO, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and surface antigens of the cells were maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated-Erk1/2 was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CSF-treated groups, although this effect was more enhanced in the 15-min MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the addition of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> CSF to the primary medium stimulated the proliferation of MSCs, and that these MSCs maintained their characteristics through the p-Erk1/2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that use of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> CSF as a component of culture media could facilitate the autologous transplantation of MSCs </plain></SENT>
