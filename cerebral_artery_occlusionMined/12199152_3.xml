<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This decrease in solubility had a strong effect on activity: CaMKII alpha was almost completely inactivated after being translocated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the phosphorylation state of CaMKII alpha revealed that in the total homogenate and the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100-nonsoluble fraction, CaMKII alpha phosphorylated at only one site was the dominant phosphorylated form, whereas in the soluble fraction CaMKII phosphorylated at two sites was the predominant phosphorylated species </plain></SENT>
