<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50831">platinum nanoparticle</z:chebi> (nPt) is a novel ROS scavenger, and thus we examined the clinical and neuroprotective effects of nPt in ischemic mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) for 60 min and divided into the following four groups by intravenous administration upon reperfusion, vehicle, tPA, tPA+nPt, and nPt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48 h after tMCAO, motor function, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, immunohistochemical analyses of neurovascular unit (NVU), in vivo imaging of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and zymography for MMP-9 activity were examined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, administration of tPA deteriorated the motor function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo optical imaging of MMP showed strong fluorescent signals in affected regions of tMCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that tMCAO resulted in a minimal decrease of NAGO and occludin, but a great decrease of collagen IV and a remarkable increase of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HEt stain showed increased ROS generation by tMCAO </plain></SENT>
