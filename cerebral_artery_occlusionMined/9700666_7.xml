<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of brain-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (BDP; Cerebrolysin) upon the amount of brain injury due to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Thomae rats were divided randomly into a sham-operated group (n = 5), an ischemic control (untreated) group (n = 7) and an ischemic BDP-treated group (n = 6) and subjected to reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h followed by 90min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local cortical blood flow (LCBF) was monitored by Laser-Doppler flowmetry to assess the MCAO and to measure the blood flow in regions peripheral to the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarcted areas of the hippocampus and subcortical structures were quantified in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional disturbances of the neurons were detected by immunohistochemical staining of the microtubule associated protein MAP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was estimated morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LCBF was estimated from the periphery of infarcted areas and was reduced to 55 to 65% of baseline values (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion led to LCBF being increased again to baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in LCBF between the control and the BDP-treated animals were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, BDP-treated animals showed a significant reduction of loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the subiculum and CA1 region by 59% and 64%, respectively, in comparison to control animals (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amount of irreversibly damaged neurons in these regions was decreased in tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the inner blade of the dentate gyrus in BDP-treated animals showed a significant reduction of neuronal injury by 98% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Likewise, BDP treatment reduced the size of the areas showing a loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the thalamic and hypothalamic structures by 51% and in the mesencephalon by 81% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The size of the infarcted areas in these regions (H&amp;E) was reduced in tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the caudate putamen, no protective effect of BDP-treatment could be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was accompanied by an increase in the volume of the ischemic hemisphere by 10 +/- 1% in the control and 8 +/- 1% in the BDP-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a beneficial effect for BDP treatment in ameliorating the early effects of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
