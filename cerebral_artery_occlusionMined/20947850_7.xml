<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> is known to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intense interest is drawn to the therapeutic potential of Chinese herbs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> because many of them contain <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leonurine, 1 of the active compounds from purified Herba Leonuri, was studied to evaluate its possible therapeutic effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method-Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was selected as our model of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were pretreated with Leonurine orally for 7 days and the surgery was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One day after surgery, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and neurological deficit score were carried out to evaluate the functional outcome of animals, whereas levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, and malondialdehyde were analyzed for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> studies, 3 hours after surgery, mitochondria were isolated for analysis of reactive oxygen species production, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> biosynthesis, oxygen consumption, and respiratory control ratio value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Result-In in vivo experiments, Leonurine pretreatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved neurological deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups, increased activities of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, and decreased levels from the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation marker malondialdehyde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> modulation, Leonurine inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species production and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animal studies also demonstrated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and redox state were restored by Leonurine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine has neuroprotective effects and carries a therapeutic potential of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
