<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine a possible protective effect of exogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene expression against ischemic brain injury, a replication-defective adenoviral vector containing GDNF gene (Ad-GDNF) was directly injected into the cerebral cortex at 1 day before 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the Ad-GDNF-injected group at 24 hours after the transient MCAO was significantly smaller than that of vehicle- or Ad-LacZ-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoreactive GDNF demonstrated that GDNF gene products in the Ad-GDNF-injected group were higher than those of vehicle-treated group at 24 hours after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive GDNF staining was obviously detected in the cortex around the needle track just before or 24 hours after MCAO in the Ad-GDNF group, whereas no or slight GDNF staining was detected in the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of TUNEL, immunoreactive caspase-3, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-positive neurons induced in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex at 24 hours after transient MCAO were markedly reduced by the Ad-GDNF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the successful exogenous GDNF gene transfer ameliorates ischemic brain injury after transient MCAO in association with the reduction of apoptotic signals </plain></SENT>
