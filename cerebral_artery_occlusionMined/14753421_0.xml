<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that the estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>; an index of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>) of water is a reliable pathophysiological index of the viability of ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF, the partition volume of water (PVW; an index of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CMR(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">glc</z:chebi>)) were measured before and after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or reperfusion with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and was compared with physiological variables obtained by PET and with histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both after permanent MCAO and reperfusion, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was significantly correlated to the CMRO2 and CMR(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">glc</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequential decrease of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was also correlated to the sequential reduction of CMRO2 in relation to the residual CBF after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction coincided with a threshold CMRO2 of 50% of the contralateral value and a threshold <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of 75% of the contralateral value, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PVW was decreased in relation to the magnitude of residual CBF after MCAO, whereas it was transiently increased in the severely ischemic lesions below 75% of the contralateral <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> is a reliable pathophysiological index which allows therapy to be tailored to the condition of individual patients in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
