<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (0.12 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 0.108 mg/kg/h infusion or 0.60 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 0.540 mg/kg/h infusion) or saline was administered just after intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of 0.540 mg/kg/h MK-801 provided strain/line-dependent neuroprotection in the following rank order: Simonsen Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats &gt; Simonsen Laboratories Wistar rats &gt; Taconic Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 0.108 mg/kg/h MK-801 treatment, Simonsen Laboratories Wistar rats were the only strain/line that were significantly neuroprotected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of an experimental drug may be influenced by rat strain and vendor differences </plain></SENT>
