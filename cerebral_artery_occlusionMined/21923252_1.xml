<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel method of stereotactic drug delivery was explored to make citicoline bypass the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and take effect by direct contact with ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model of rats was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To get the optimal conditions for citicoline administration by the novel stereotactic delivery pathway, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracer method was used, and a dose-dependent effect was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examinations of MRI, behavior evaluation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume assessment and histological staining were performed to evaluate the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This MRI-guided stereotactic delivery of citicoline resulted in a notable reduction (&gt;80%) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and a delayed ischemic injury in cortex 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when compared with the systematic delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improved neuroprotective efficiency was realized by a full distribution of citicoline in most of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory and an adequate drug reaction in the involved areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain lesions</z:e> of treated rats by stereotactic delivery of citicoline were well predicted in the lateral ventricle and thalamus due to a limited drug deposition by MRI tracer method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study realized an improved neuroprotective efficiency of citicoline by stereotactic delivery, and an optimal therapeutic effect of this administration pathway can be achieved under MRI guidance </plain></SENT>
