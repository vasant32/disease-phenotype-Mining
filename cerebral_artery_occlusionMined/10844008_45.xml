<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether blockade of group I caspases, mainly caspase-1, using the inhibitor Ac-YVAD.cmk reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and produced prolonged neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ac-YVAD.cmk (300 ng/rat) was injected intracerebroventricularly 10 min after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment induced a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume not only 24 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (total damage, percentage of hemisphere volume: control, 41.1 +/- 2.3%; treated, 26.5 +/- 2.1%; p &lt; 0.05) but also 6 d later (total damage: control, 30.6 +/- 2.2%; treated, 23.0 +/- 2.2%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ac-YVAD. cmk treatment resulted in a reduction not only of caspase-1 (control, 100 +/- 20.3%; treated, 3.4 +/- 10.4%; p &lt; 0.01) but also of caspase-3 (control, 100 +/- 30.3%; treated, 13.2 +/- 9.5%; p &lt; 0.05) activity at 24 hr and led to a parallel decrease of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as measured by nucleosome quantitation (control, 100 +/- 11.8%; treated, 47 +/- 5.9%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six days after treatment no differences in these parameters could be detected between control and treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, brain levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were reduced at 24 hr (39.5 +/- 23.7 and 51.9 +/- 10.3% of control, respectively) but not at 6 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other cytokines, IL-10, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, MIP-2, and the gaseous mediator nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, were not modified by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that blockade of caspase-1-like activity induces a long-lasting neuroprotective effect that, in our experimental conditions, takes place in the early stages of damage progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, this effect is achieved by interfering with both apoptotic and inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
