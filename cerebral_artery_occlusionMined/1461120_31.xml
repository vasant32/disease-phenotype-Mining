<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Varying ischemic intervals (12 s to 30 min) were caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rapid signal drop was noted upon occlusion, due to deoxygenation of static blood in the ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon successful reperfusion, the signal intensity recovered immediately and increased above (overshot) the baseline level before slowly returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The "overshoot" response was strongly dependent on the duration of the ischemic interval and is thought to reflect reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
