<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidyl peptidase IV, aminopeptidase N as well as the dipeptidyl peptidases II, 8 and 9 and cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22280,32441">alanyl</z:chebi>-aminopeptidase are involved in the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression, localisation and activity patterns of these proteases after endothelin-induced occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats, a model of transient and unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and protease activity assays were performed at different time points, lasting from 2 h to 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes was quantified 7 days post middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was conducted using the t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Qualitative RT-PCR revealed these proteases in ipsilateral and contralateral cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidyl peptidase II and aminopeptidase N were up-regulated ipsilaterally from 6 h to 7 days post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase 9 and cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22280,32441">alanyl</z:chebi>-aminopeptidase were transiently down-regulated at day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and aminopeptidase N immunoreactivities were detected in cortical neurons of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the same time point, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, 8 and aminopeptidase N were identified in activated microglia and macrophages in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven days post <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, dipeptidyl peptidase IV immunoreactivity was found in the perikarya of surviving cortical neurons of the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas their nuclei were dipeptidyl peptidase 8- and amino peptidase N-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the same time point, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, 8 and aminopeptidase N were targeted in astroglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total dipeptidyl peptidase IV, 8 and 9 activities remained constant in both hemispheres until day 3 post experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but were increased (+165%) in the ipsilateral cortex at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In parallel, aminopeptidase N and cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22280,32441">alanyl</z:chebi>-aminopeptidase activities remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Distinct expression, localization and activity patterns of proline- and alanine-specific proteases indicate their involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-triggered <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Consistently, IPC1755, a non-selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, revealed a significant reduction of cortical lesions after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may suggest dipeptidyl peptidase IV, aminopeptidase N and proteases with similar substrate specificity as potentially therapy-relevant targets </plain></SENT>
