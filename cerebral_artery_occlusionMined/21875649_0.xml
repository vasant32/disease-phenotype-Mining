<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since a similar reaction to the phenomenon of distant heat is found in some transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) rats treated by a 40-min SM session with tail temperature increase (TTI), we hereby study its mechanism by comparing the neuroprotective effect of 40 min's SM with TTI to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental results show that 40 min's SM with TTI can significantly reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit score in tMCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot demonstrates that a reduction in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression in tMCAO rats with TTI is more striking than that of the rats without TTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of caspase-3 protein is inhibited in tMCAO rats with TTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the efficacy of SM for 40 min with TTI is higher than that without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although neuroprotective effects present in tMCAO rats with and without TTI, those with TTI revealed a higher level of anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> effect and exhibited an anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> effect </plain></SENT>
