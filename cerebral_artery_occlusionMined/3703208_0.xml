<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, the diagnosis was confirmed promptly by computed tomography and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aggressive volume expansion therapy was started 2 to 18 hours (mean, 11 hr) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean colloidal volume used was 920 ml/day for an average of 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During volume expansion, the mean cardiac output increased 57% from 4.6 +/- 0.6 to 7.2 +/- 1.9 litres/min (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean hematocrit decreased 19% from 46 +/- 3% to 37 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial blood pressure remained stable, and the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was maintained at less than 15 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients improved dramatically with volume expansion therapy and have returned to their previous life-styles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients made partial recoveries and manage at home with nursing care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The three patients who improved dramatically were young (aged less than 34) and, when compared to the older patients, they had greater increases in cardiac output (67% vs. 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributed to the volume expansion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that intravascular volume expansion and its concomitant augmentation of the cardiovascular dynamics may be effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
