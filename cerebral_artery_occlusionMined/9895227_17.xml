<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential mechanism of reperfusion injury by neutrophils is through production of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, due to progressive endothelial damage during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, neutrophil activation would be more prominent after longer periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, neutrophils would contribute more to pathological processes such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> formation after longer than after shorter periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats was employed and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> concentration was measured with a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> coated electrode placed on the cortical penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusion times were varied from 60 min to 2 h, and neutrophils were inhibited with an antiCD18 antibody administered prior to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil accumulation and reduction with antibody treatment was confirmed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (O2*-) concentration was detected during the hours following 60 min of occlusion, and increased further with 2 h of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the antiCD18 antibody had no effect on O2*- concentration during reperfusion in the 60-90 min occlusion groups, but O2*- concentration was significantly lower in the antiCD18 antibody treated group than in the control group during reperfusion after 120 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antibody also reduced cortical neutrophil accumulation in the 120 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate for the first time that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production by neutrophils becomes more important with longer periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and other quantitatively less important sources of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> predominate with shorter periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may explain some of the variation seen between different models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with different durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when targeting reactive oxygen species, and supports an approach to combination therapy to extend the therapeutic window and reduce the deleterious effects of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
