<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1R (glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Ex-4 (exendin-4) is a drug for the treatment of T2D (Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) that may also have neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of Ex-4 against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by using a diabetic animal model, a drug administration paradigm and a dose that mimics a diabetic patient on Ex-4 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neurogenesis as potential cellular mechanisms underlying the Ex-4 efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of seven 9-month-old Type 2 diabetic Goto–Kakizaki rats were treated peripherally for 4 weeks with Ex-4 at 0.1, 1 or 5 μg/kg of body weight before inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and for 2–4 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of ischaemic damage was measured by evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and by stereological counting of neurons in the striatum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also quantitatively evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show a profound anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> efficacy of the clinical dose of Ex-4 in diabetic rats, an arrested microglia infiltration and an increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neural stem cell proliferation and neuroblast formation, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurogenesis was not affected by Ex-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show a pronounced anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of peripheral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Ex-4 treatment in middle-aged diabetic animals in a preclinical setting that has the potential to mimic the clinical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results should provide strong impetus to further investigate GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> for their neuroprotective action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and for their possible use as anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> medication in non-diabetic conditions </plain></SENT>
