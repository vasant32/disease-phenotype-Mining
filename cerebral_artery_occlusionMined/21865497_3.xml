<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Remote ischemic postconditioning (RPostC) is an emerging concept for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> protection, and its potential protective mechanisms have not been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to investigate the implications of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and δ protein kinase C (δPKC) in neuroprotection induced by RPostC in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and also to explore a possible relationship between ROS and εPKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using the intraluminal filament technique in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RPostC was generated by 3 10-minute cycles of femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion on the right limb at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral artery reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RPostC was performed alone or with pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, a ROS scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In separate group, TAT-δV1-1, a δPKC-selective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor, was administered at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain ischemic injury was evaluated by neurologic scores, infarction volumes, and TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the activation of δPKC in the ischemic penumbra was investigated by Western blot after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RPostC improved neurologic outcome, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and inhibited neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as suppressed the activation of δPKC after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, systemic delivery of TAT-δV1-1 conferred neuroprotection against cerebral reperfusion injury at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> not only completely prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of RPostC-induced neuroprotection, but also reversed RPostC-induced inhibition of δPKC activation after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that RPostC performed in one limb alleviated reperfusion injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through ROS-mediated inhibition of endogenous δPKC activation signaling cascade in an in vivo rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
