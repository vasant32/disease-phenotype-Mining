<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We implanted 17 silver ball electrodes symmetrically distributed over the skull in 14 rats and registered electroencephalography activity and somatosensory evoked potentials before, 1 hour, and 1 week after permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before vessel occlusion, a symmetric distribution of electroencephalography power was seen over both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused a complete abolishment of electroencephalography power in the frontolateral aspects of the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When electroencephalographic recordings 7 days after the insult were superimposed with three-dimensional-reconstructed pictures of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, a close correspondence of the extention and spatial orientation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two negative and two positive peaks were consistently recorded before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both control and ipsapirone-treated (30 mg/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>30 minutes after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) animals, the vessel occlusion caused a severe reduction in amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas under record (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One week after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, amplitudes of somatosensory potentials over the lesioned hemisphere were still significantly (p less than 0.05) lower than preischemic values in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When compared with the corresponding values 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, an albeit insignificant tendency toward increased amplitudes was observed in most areas under record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in ipsapirone-treated animals, significant differences compared with preischemic values were no longer present 1 week after the vessel occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
