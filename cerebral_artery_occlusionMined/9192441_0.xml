<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In anesthetized cats, a catheter was introduced just distal to the site of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion through the transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stump pressure following occlusion was approximately 20 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Solute infusion with hydrostatic pressure exceeding stump pressure by approximately 20 mmHg was found to be sufficient to perfuse the entire territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial angiography revealed that cortical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches were fully opacified first, and within 10 seconds disappeared centrifugally from the penumbral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When vessels were occluded together with the internal carotid artery and anterior cerebral artery, backflow was delayed such that the contrast material remained longer within the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This new technique provides a sound basis not only for investigating local hemodynamics but also for direct pharmacological manipulation of the ischemic vessels and brain tissues </plain></SENT>
