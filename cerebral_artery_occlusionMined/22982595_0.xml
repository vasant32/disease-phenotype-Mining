<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible transcription factor alpha (HIF-α), an important transcription factor for several genes, may attenuate ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently identified a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e>-repeat protein designated Morg1 (MAPK organizer 1) that interacts with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> hydroxylase 3 (PHD3), an important enzyme involved in the regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While homozygous Morg1(-/-) mice are embryonically lethal, heterozygous Morg1(+/-) mice have a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain vasculature as well as systolic blood pressure in Morg1(+/-) mice were indistinguishable from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that Morg1(+/-) mice were partially protected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in comparison to WT (Morg1(+/+)) animals using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morg1(+/-) mice compared with WT animals revealed a significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as detected by Nissl and Map 2 staining despite a similar restriction of blood flow in both mice genotypes as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed specific Morg1 expression in reactive astrocytes in the ipsilateral (ischemic) hemisphere in Morg1(+/-) and WT mice, especially in the penumbral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, Morg1 was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Morg1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly enhanced in the ischemic brain of WT, but not in ischemic brain tissue obtained from Morg1(+/-) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, HIF-1α was expressed with the same intensity in Morg1(+/-) and WT mice with no difference between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No positive staining for HIF-2α was found in ischemic (ipsilateral) and non-ischemic (contralateral) brain regions in Morg1(+/+) and Morg1(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Almost no PHD3 staining was found in the contralateral hemispheres of either WT or heterozygous Morg1(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transcript expression for the HIF1α-dependent genes erythropoietin (Epo) and vascular endothelial growth factor 164 (VEGF 164) were significantly reduced in the ischemic brain from Morg1(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Positive staining for PHD3 in the ipsilateral hemisphere of WT mice was suggested to occur in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A compensatory increase in Morg1 expression in astrocytes in the penumbra may negatively influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It appears that these effects are independent of the PHD3-HIF1α axis </plain></SENT>
