<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The in vivo imaging of decreased GFAP gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was examined in the present studies using a targeted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>), which was labeled with (111)In, and which hybridized to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 20-37 of the rat GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> was monobiotinylated, and was attached to a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the transferrin receptor (TfR) via a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-streptavidin linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TfR MAb enables trans-membrane transport of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> antisense radiopharmaceutical from blood to the cytosol of brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decreased GFAP gene expression at 24 hr after a 1-hr reversible MCAO was confirmed by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The [(111)In]-labeled <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> - MAb conjugate was administered intravenously to anesthetized rats at 24 hr after the 1-hr reversible MCAO, and the brain uptake of the targeted antisense imaging agent was decreased relative to brain regions outside of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies provide evidence that decreased expression of a target gene in brain can be imaged in vivo with a sequence-specific <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>, provided the antisense radiopharmaceutical is delivered across cell membranes with a receptor-specific targeting agent </plain></SENT>
