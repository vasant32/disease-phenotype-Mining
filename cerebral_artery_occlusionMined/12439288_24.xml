<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, STAT1, which is expressed in the brain and directly activated by reactive oxygen species, participates in the regulation of cytokine-signaling and cellular responses, particularly to interferon-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little, however, is known about the importance of STAT1 during brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors found that STAT1 was phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine727 and translocated into neuronal nuclei within hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At later time points, STAT1 immunoreactivity colocalized with TUNEL-positive neurons, thereby suggesting a role in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice genetically deficient in STAT1 expression, the volume of ischemic brain injury was reduced, neurologic deficits were less severe, and TUNEL-positive neurons were also less numerous compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STAT1-knockout mice showed increased phosphorylated Akt and decreased procaspase-3 cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major strain differences in phosphorylated STAT3 or cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression were not found after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that STAT1 is activated and translocated within ischemic neurons and may contribute to brain injury by regulating transcription and phosphorylation of proteins related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
