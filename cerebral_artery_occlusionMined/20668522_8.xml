<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microglia are resident immunocompetent and phagocytic cells of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), which produce various cytokines and growth factors in response to injury and thereby regulate disease pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of microglial transplantation on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats was induced by the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMO6 cells, human microglial cell line, were transplanted intravenously at 48 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional tests were performed and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 7 and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Migration and cell survival of transplanted microglial cells and host glial reaction in the brain were studied by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of neurotrophic factors, cytokines and chemokines in transplanted cells and host rat glial cells was determined by laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and quantitative real time-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HMO6 human microglial cells transplantation group demonstrated significant functional recovery compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 7 and 14 days after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the HMO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the HMO6 group, number of apoptotic cells was time-dependently reduced in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, number of host rat microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes was significantly decreased at 7 and 14 days after MCAO in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of various neurotrophic factors (GDNF, BDNF, VEGF and BMP7) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and IL5) was up-regulated in transplanted HMO6 cells of brain tissue compared with those in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of GDNF and VEGF in astrocytes in penumbra was significantly up-regulated in the HMO6 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that transplantation of HMO6 human microglial cells reduces ischemic deficits and apoptotic events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results were mediated by modulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and neuroinflammation, and neuroprotection provided by neurotrophic factors of endogenous and transplanted cells-origin </plain></SENT>
