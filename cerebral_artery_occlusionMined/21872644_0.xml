<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of olprinone on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the detailed mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of olprinone on inflammatory and apoptotic responses induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by transient MCAo in the right hemisphere, via the external carotid artery into the internal carotid to block the origin of the median carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 h) followed by reperfusion (22 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Olprinone was administered 5 min before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAo-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was associated with an increase in inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression, nitrotyrosine formation, as well as IL-1Î² expression and ICAM-1 expression in ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Olprinone treatment showed marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared with control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These expressions were markedly inhibited by olprinone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that olprinone reduces levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (TUNEL, Bax and Bcl-2 expression) resulting in a reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings we propose that olprinone would be useful in lowering the risk of damage or improving function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury-related disorders </plain></SENT>
