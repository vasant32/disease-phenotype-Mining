<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs interact with and alter brain parenchymal cells by direct cell-cell communication and/or by indirect secretion of factors and thereby promote functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that MSC treatment of rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) significantly increased microRNA 133b (miR-133b) level in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, miR-133b levels in MSCs and in their exosomes increased after MSCs were exposed to ipsilateral ischemic tissue extracts from rats subjected to MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miR-133b levels were also increased in primary cultured neurons and astrocytes treated with the exosome-enriched fractions released from these MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of miR-133b in MSCs confirmed that the increased miR-133b level in astrocytes is attributed to their transfer from MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further verification of this exosome-mediated intercellular communication was performed using a cel-miR-67 luciferase reporter system and an MSC-astrocyte coculture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cel-miR-67 in MSCs was transferred to astrocytes via exosomes between 50 and 100 nm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the cel-miR-67 released from MSCs was primarily contained in exosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A gap junction intercellular communication inhibitor arrested the exosomal microRNA communication by inhibiting exosome release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cultured neurons treated with exosome-enriched fractions from MSCs exposed to 72 hours post-MCAo brain extracts significantly increased the neurite branch number and total neurite length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first demonstration that MSCs communicate with brain parenchymal cells and may regulate neurite outgrowth by transfer of miR-133b to neural cells via exosomes </plain></SENT>
