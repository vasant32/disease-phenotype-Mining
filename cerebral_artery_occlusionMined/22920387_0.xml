<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Intracerebral administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 2 receptor (AT2R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, CGP42112, is neuroprotective in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore further its possible cellular target(s) and therapeutic utility, we firstly examined whether CGP42112 may exert direct protective effects on primary neurons following <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we tested whether CGP42112 is effective when administered systemically in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary cortical neurons were cultured from E17 C57Bl6 mouse embryos for 9 d, exposed to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation for 24 h alone or with drug treatments, and percent cell survival assessed using trypan blue exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in adult male C57Bl6 mice by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 23.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment was performed and then mice were euthanized and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, CGP42112 (1x10-8 M and 1x10-7 M) reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by ~30%, an effect that was prevented by the AT2R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, PD123319 (1x10-6 M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by CGP42112 was lost at a higher concentration (1x10-6 M) but was unmasked by co-application with the AT1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (1x10-7 M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Compound 21 (1x10-8 M to 1x10-6 M), a second AT2R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, had no effect on neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with CGP42112 (1 mg/kg i.p.) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> had improved functional outcomes over vehicle-treated mice as well as reduced total and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CGP42112 can directly protect neurons from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like injury in vitro via activation of AT2Rs, an effect opposed by AT1R activation at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, systemic administration of CGP42112 can reduce functional deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
