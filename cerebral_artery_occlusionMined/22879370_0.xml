<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we document the pivotal role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL), one of the recognition molecules of the lectin complement pathway, in brain ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in mice (by permanent or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) and rats (by 3-vessel occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first observed that MBL is deposited on ischemic vessels up to 48 hours after injury and that functional MBL/MBL-associated serine protease 2 complexes are increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, we demonstrated that (1) MBL(-/-) mice are protected from both transient and permanent ischemic injury; (2) Polyman2, the newly synthesized mannosylated molecule selected for its binding to MBL, improves neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when given up to 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in mice; (3) anti-MBL-A antibody improves neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when given up to 18 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as assessed after 28 days in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show an important role for MBL in the pathogenesis of brain ischemic injury and provide a strong support to the concept that MBL inhibition may be a relevant therapeutic target in humans, one with a wide therapeutic window of application </plain></SENT>
