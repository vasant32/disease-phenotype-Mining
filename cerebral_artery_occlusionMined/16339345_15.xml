<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a well-characterized animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the present study was undertaken to 1) study the profile of plasma arginine-vasopressin (AVP), and 2) determine whether osmotherapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and various concentrations of hypertonic saline (HS) solutions influence plasma AVP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma AVP levels (means +/- SD) were significantly elevated at 24 h (42 +/- 21 pg/ml), 48 h (50 +/- 28 pg/ml), and 72 h (110 +/- 47 pg/ml), and returned to baseline at 96 h (22 +/- 15 pg/ml) following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with sham-operated controls (14 +/- 7 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma AVP levels at 72 h were significantly attenuated with 7.5% HS (37 +/- 8 pg/ml; 360 +/- 11 osmol/l) compared with 0.9% saline (73 +/- 6; 292 +/- 6 osmol/l), 3% HS (66 +/- 8 pg/ml; 303 +/- 12 osmol/l), or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (74 +/- 9 pg/ml; 313 +/- 14 osmol/l) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HS (7.5%) significantly attenuated water content in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres compared with surgical shams, 0.9% saline, 3% HS, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak plasma AVP levels were not associated with direct histopathological injury to the anterior hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of brain water content with 7.5% HS treatment coincides with attenuated serum AVP levels, and we speculate that this may represent one additional mechanism by which osmotherapy attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
