<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the expression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in brain capillaries of diabetic rats in relation to focal ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> type 1 was induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was induced by 50% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in brain capillaries was determined by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was produced by 1 hour of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables and cerebral blood flow were monitored during occlusion and within 1 hour of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological and neuropathologic examinations were performed after 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats developed comparable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (approximately 15 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> protein and 6.5-fold decrease in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in brain capillaries of diabetic rats, in contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> capillary levels in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The blood flow in the periphery of the ischemic core was significantly reduced during reperfusion by 52% to 62% (P&lt;.001) in diabetic rats and by 23% to 25% (P&lt;.05) in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neurological score was worsened by 3.2-fold (P&lt;.0003) by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and by 24% by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant 41% (P&lt;.007) and 29% (P&lt;.05) increases in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and 163% (P&lt;.007) and 60% increases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume were found in diabetic rats relative to control and hyperglycemic rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> type 1, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, produces downregulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in rat brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> reduction is associated with impaired restoration of blood flow after an ischemic insult, poor neurological outcome, and enhanced ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
