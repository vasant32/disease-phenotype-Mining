<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was undergone after the introduction of a nylon suture to the left internal carotid artery in 70 male adult CD-1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was detected using Western blot analysis, and the morphological feature was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ERK pathway inhibitor, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48499">phenylthio</z:chebi>] <z:chebi fb="7" ids="39479">butadiene</z:chebi> (U0126), was administered intravenously 20 minutes before MCAO, and the neurological deficit levels and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (pERK 1/2) activity increased after 30 minutes of MCAO and peaked at 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical study displayed a large number of pERK 1/2 positive cells in the ischemic basal ganglion and surrounding cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-labeled fluorescent staining identified the pERK1/2 positive cells as neurons or astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In U0126 treated mice which had undergone 24 hours of MCAO, the neurological deficit levels and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 44.6% and 45.8% respectively, less than those of the control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ERK plays an important role in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and inhibition of the ERK pathway can help protect against ischemic brain injury, which may provide a therapeutic approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
