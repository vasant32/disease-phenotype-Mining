<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the impact of these labels on the cells' ability to repair is therefore vital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the transhemispheric migration of MHP36 cells labelled with the bimodal contrast agent GRID was detected on magnetic resonance images (MRI) up to 4 weeks following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, compared to MHP36 cells labelled with the red <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> PKH26, GRID-labelled transplants did not significantly improve behaviour, and performance was akin to non-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the evolution of anatomical damage as assessed by serial, T(2)-weighted MRI over 1 year indicated that GRID-labelled transplants resulted in a slight increase in lesion size compared to MCAo-only animals, whereas the same, PKH26-labelled cells significantly decreased lesion size by 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although GRID labelling allows the in vivo identification of transplanted cells up to 1 month after transplantation, it is likely that some is gradually degraded inside cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The translation of cellular imaging therefore does not only require the in vitro assessment of contrast agents on cellular functions, but also requires the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, in vivo assessment of the label on the stem cells' ability to repair in preclinical models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
