<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Over the past 5 years, experimental data have emerged that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways may differ in males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in males is triggered by poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase activation and nuclear translocation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that interference with this pathway benefits males but not females after an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, caspase activation may be the major pathway activated after ischemic injury in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine whether sex differences exist in caspase activation in adult mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to determine if interference with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced caspase activation preferentially protects females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (90 minutes) in young and aging C57BL/6 mice of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pan-caspase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17362">quinoline</z:chebi>-Val-Asp(Ome)-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29357,29358,29360,29361,51375,51376">CH2</z:chebi>-O-phenoxy was administered at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological outcomes were assessed 48 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis of key cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-8, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Drug-treated female mice had significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurological deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17362">Quinoline</z:chebi>-Val-Asp(Ome)-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29357,29358,29360,29361,51375,51376">CH2</z:chebi>-O-phenoxy administration had no effect in male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C and nuclear caspase-8 levels were increased in females after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Female mice had an early release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C and enhanced caspase activation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Caspase inhibition benefited females but not males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sex differences exist in both the response to ischemic injury and the efficacy of neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
