<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Exercise increases neuron survival and plasticity in the adult brain by enhancing the uptake of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise also reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the ischemic brain and improves motor function after such a brain insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of IGF-I signaling in neuroprotection after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rats were assigned to one of four groups: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) without exercise training (MC), MCAO with exercise training (ME), MCAO with IGF-I receptor inhibitor and without exercise training (MAg), and MCAO with IGF-I receptor inhibitor and exercise training (MEAg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in the ME and MEAg groups underwent treadmill training for 14 d, and rats in the MC and MAg groups served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the final intervention, rats were sacrificed under anesthesia, and samples were collected from the affected motor cortex, striatum, and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IGF-I and p-Akt levels in the affected motor cortex and the striatum of the ME group were significantly higher than those in the MC group, with significant decreases in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improvements in motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, IGF-I receptor inhibitor eliminated these effects and decreased the exercise ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The brain IGF-I signaling strongly correlated with exercise ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-enhanced IGF-I entrance into ischemic brain and IGF-I signaling was related to exercise-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 signaling also affected the ability to exercise after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
