<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A substantial number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients do not respond immediately to aggressive intra-arterial (IA) recanalization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors and outcomes associated with timing of recanalization after IA thrombolysis, however, have not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Factors and outcomes in 75 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with IA urokinase (± intravenous tissue plasminogen activator) within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were retrospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate recanalization (IR) was assessed by the angiogram at the end of the IA procedure, and delayed (DR) and no (NR) recanalization were assessed by 5-day <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were determined at 7 days and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 75 patients, 32 (42.7%) achieved IR, 21 (28%) achieved DR, and 22 (29.3%) showed NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good functional outcomes (mRS score ≤2) at 7 days and 3 months were observed in 59.4 and 62.5%, respectively, of the IR group, 14.3 and 38.1% of the DR group, and 22.7 and 27.3% of the NR group (p = 0.001 for 7 days, p = 0.028 for 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that cardioembolism [odds ratio (OR), 3.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-12.19] and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.04-10.04) were independent predictors of IR or DR compared with NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and initial NIHSS score (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.37) were independent predictors of DR compared with IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving IA thrombolysis show different clinical and radiological characteristics according to the timing of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier identification of DR patients and their more efficient recanalization may improve overall clinical outcomes after IA thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
