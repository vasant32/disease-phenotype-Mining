<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodilution was achieved with a molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> solution (DCLHb) and albumin which have similar viscosities but different oxygen carrying capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Part A: CBF was assessed in rats after one of the following regimens: (1) control-hematocrit not manipulated, (2) 30/Alb-hematocrit decreased to 30% with albumin, (3) 30/DCLHb-hematocrit decreased to 30% with DCLHb, or (4) 16/Alb/DCLHb-hematocrit decreased to 30% with albumin and then 16% with DCLHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For viscosity matched groups (30/Alb and 30/DCLHb), CBF was greater in animals with decreased oxygen content (30/Alb); while in oxygen content matched groups (30/Alb and 16/Alb/DCLHb), CBF was greater in animals with decreased viscosity (16/Alb/DCLHb) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Part B: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed, hemodilution achieved as in Part A, and CBF determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For viscosity matched groups (30/Alb and 30/DCLHb), CBF was less in rats with decreased oxygen content (30/Alb); while in oxygen content matched groups (30/Alb and 16/Alb/DCLHb), CBF was greater in animals with decreased viscosity (16/Alb/DCLHb) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This data supports the premise, that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, both viscosity and oxygen content effect CBF; while in ischemic brain, a decrease in viscosity but not oxygen content increases CBF </plain></SENT>
