<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether CGA has protective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and whether these effects are due to modification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>-related vascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo, 2h of occlusion followed by 22 h of reperfusion), we measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and performed behavioral test to evaluate the effects of CGA on brain damage and sensory-motor functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain water content and Evans blue extravasation were measured to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) and the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were measured to investigate the mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal injection of CGA (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) at 0 h and 2h after MCAo dose-dependently reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and sensory-motor functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also reduced brain water content and Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, CGA reduced LPO and MMPs expressions and activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CGA reduces brain damage, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> by radical scavenging activity and the inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
