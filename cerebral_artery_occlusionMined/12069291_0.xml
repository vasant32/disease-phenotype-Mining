<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy rats were randomly allocated to four main groups: Group I (n = 10) consisted of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; Group II (n = 20) underwent craniectomy only; Group III (n = 20) was subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; and Group IV (n = 20) underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treatment with anti-rat IL-6 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the rats from each of Groups II, III and IV were killed at 24 h and the other half at 72 h after craniectomy alone or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single dose of antibody did not affect middle cerebral artery caliber, but administration of three doses resulted in a significant increase in the diameter of middle cerebral artery compared to the findings in the corresponding occlusion-only groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that neutralization of rat IL-6 bioactivity in long-term recovery increases the collateral blood supply from retrograde flow via cortical anastomoses after experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
