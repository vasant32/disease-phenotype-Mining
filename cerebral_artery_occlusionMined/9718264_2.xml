<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were either injected with 1 mg/kg i.v. of eliprodil or with the vehicle only (placebo) 5 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, or not injected (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten coronal slices were acquired every hour, up to 7 h after occlusion of the artery, and the volume of hyperintense signals was measured at each time point and for each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion magnetic resonance images revealed that the administration of eliprodil reduced significantly (by 50% or more) the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, up to 7 h after occlusion, particularly in the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show the potential efficacy of eliprodil to reduce the cerebral ischaemic volume after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, thus confirming the interest of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
