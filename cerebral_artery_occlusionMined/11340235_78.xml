<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Iba1 is a novel calcium-binding protein and is specifically expressed in microglia in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that Iba1 plays an important role in regulation of the function of microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined time-dependent Iba1 expression after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and characterized microglial activation in various brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced by the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1.5 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, Iba1 expression was examined by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The microglial activation in association with ischemic severity was characterized by double immunostaining with other specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the peri-ischemic area, heavily Iba1 immunoreactive cells rapidly appeared at 3.5 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity was further increased and peaked at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, round Iba1-positive cells, which may be blood-borne monocytes, appeared from 24 hours and reached a peak at 4 to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining revealed that activated microglia in the peri-ischemic area upregulated Iba1 expression but were negative for the macrophage marker ED1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ED1-positive cells were clearly restricted to the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the following: (1) Iba1 expression may be associated with microglial activation in ischemic brain, and Iba1 immunostaining can be useful to evaluate the pathophysiological roles of activated microglia in ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) Expression of ED1 antigen is strictly restricted to severe ischemic damage, whereas activated microglia in the peri-ischemic area showed Iba1 upregulation without ED1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, microglia may exhibit difference of antigenicity in the severity of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
