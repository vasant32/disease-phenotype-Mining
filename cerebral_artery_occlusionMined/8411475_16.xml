<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study examines the current role of diagnostic tests done before carotid endarterectomy and the need for routine arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied vascular surgeons' decision-making over a 29-month period during which 111 carotid arteries in 103 patients were considered for endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each case the surgeon's management plan was recorded after clinical evaluation and review of the duplex scan findings, but before arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This plan was later compared with the patient's ultimate clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 111 total cases in this period, 17 were excluded from analysis because arteriography was not done or it was performed before the surgeon's evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid duplex scans were diagnostic in 87 (93%) of the remaining 94 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The carotid lesion was incompletely assessed by duplex scanning in seven patients because the disease was not limited to the distal common or proximal internal carotid artery (n = 4); anatomic or pathologic features of the carotid artery interfered with imaging or accurate Doppler assessment (n = 1); or an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> could not be distinguished from a high-grade stenosis (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When a technically adequate duplex scan showed significant disease of the carotid bifurcation, arteriography contributed information that affected clinical management in only a single case (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient had a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> distal to a high-grade carotid bifurcation stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical assessment and duplex scanning were sufficient for the preoperative evaluation of 93% of the candidates for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical circumstances or atypical duplex scan findings can be used to identify the minority of patients for whom arteriography is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this experience, we have developed practical guidelines for the selective use of arteriography before carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
