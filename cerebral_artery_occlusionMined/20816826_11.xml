<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effects of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (PROG) and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent pMCAO by electro-coagulation and received intraperitoneal injections of PROG (8 mg/kg), ALLO (8 mg/kg) or vehicle at 1 h post-occlusion and then subcutaneous injections (8 mg/kg) at 6, 24, and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMP activation and expression were analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and gelatin zymography 72 h post-pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occludin1, claudin5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analyzed at 72 h post-pMCAO with Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was measured by Evans blue extravasation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> at 72 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, TNF-α and IL-6, and reduced the levels of occludin1 and claudin5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were followed by increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (% contralateral hemisphere) and Evans blue extravasation into the brain indicating compromise of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PROG and ALLO attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following pMCAO by reducing MMPs and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and by preventing the degradation of occludin1 and claudin5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PROG and ALLO can help to protect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
