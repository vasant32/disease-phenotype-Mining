<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, notably transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), are used to assess the efficacy of pharmacological and transplant treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies (&gt;1 month) of the functional effects of treatments in animal models are required to predict treatments likely to improve dysfunctions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pre-clinical studies require (1) optimum post-operative care to ensure long-term survival, (2) methods for assignment of rats to groups with equivalent impairments to reduce variability and enhance detection of treatment effects, and (3) behavioural tests that detect long-term stable deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For long-term functional assessment, a battery of behavioural tests sensitive to a range of deficits observed after MCAo was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bilateral asymmetry test evaluated the time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751419" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sensory neglect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deficits of motor integration were examined in the footfault test, and motor bias was assessed by pharmacological stimulation of rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The water maze was used to detect long-term deficits in spatial information processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term differences between control and MCAo animals in this battery of tests indicate that the protocol provides an efficient assessment suitable for evaluating treatment outcomes in pre-clinical studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and that the post-operative care procedure and method of assignment to groups were effective </plain></SENT>
