<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently developed a promising <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) ligand, [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PBR28, with high affinity and excellent ratio of specific to nonspecific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the ability of [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PBR28 PET to localize PBRs in a rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PBR28 was intravenously administered to rats at 4 and 7 days after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments, arterial blood was sampled for compartmental modeling of regional distribution volumes, and rat brains were sampled after imaging for in vitro [3H]PK 11195 autoradiography and histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PBR28 PET and [3H]PK 11195 autoradiography showed similar areas of increased PBRs, especially in the peri-ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from these in vivo and in vitro methods were strongly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this first study to demonstrate neuroinflammation in vivo with small animal PET, [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PBR28 had adequate sensitivity to localize and quantify the associated increase in PBRs </plain></SENT>
