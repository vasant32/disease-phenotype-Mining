<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the anteriorcerebral arteries of the rat may now also be bilaterally occluded by stereotaxic injection of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1, resulting in ischemic damage to medial prefrontal cortex and the anteromedial basal forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavioural consequences of anterior-cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ACAo) were studied in two experiments using simple and choice reaction-time tasks designed to dissociate response impairments from dysfunction of motivation and attention, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following ACAo, reaction-time increased post-surgery in the choice, but not simple reaction-time task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also an increase in incorrect choices in the choice reaction-time task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the impairments were independent of motivational or attentional function, which remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the ACAo-induced ischemic damage did not disrupt motivation or attention, the results suggest that the lesion results in an executive impairment in selecting and initiating responses </plain></SENT>
