<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug (1 mg/ kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and diffusion-weighted images were acquired at various times thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the drug reduced the size of the hyperintensity during the first hours, but did not affect the time constant of growth or the final size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporary reduction of the cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> induced by the torasemide derivative, demonstrates an antioedematous activity </plain></SENT>
