<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms of healthy spontaneously hypertensive rats were obtained without the use of contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total imaging time ranged from 1 to 50 min for a 3D data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influences of the data matrix and the inflow delay on the image quality and the total imaging time are assessed and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Varying the inflow delay yielded in addition semiquantitative information on hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to obtain angiograms in rat models of permanent and temporal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion and reopening of the vessel could easily be verified by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after reperfusion a slight reduction in blood flow was observed </plain></SENT>
