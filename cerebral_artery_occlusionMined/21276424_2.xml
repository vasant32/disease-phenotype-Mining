<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared neuroprotective effects of single or combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> (AM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (AT) in such a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> model <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were pretreated with vehicle, AM, AT, or the combination of AM plus AT for 28days, and physical and serum parameters were analyzed, then 90min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO), was performed followed by immunohistochemical analyses at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Without affecting serum levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, adiponectin, and leptin, the combination therapy of AM plus AT ameliorated the post-ischemic brain weight increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The single treatment with AM or AT itself exerted neuroprotective effects with reducing inductions of MMP-9 and AT2R, as well as with preserving collagen IV, and the combination therapy of AM plus AT showed a further synergistic benefit against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic neural damages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single AT was more protective on these 3 molecules than single AM at this time point of 24h after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combination therapy with AM plus AT extended the neuroprotectives effect of single treatment with AM or AT on a part of neurovascular unit and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-related receptor </plain></SENT>
