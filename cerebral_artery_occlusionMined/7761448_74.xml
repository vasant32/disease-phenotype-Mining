<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent results have demonstrated that the spin trapping agent N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), even when given after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to explore whether PBN influences recovery of energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO of 2-hr duration was induced in rats by an intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were frozen in situ at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and after 1, 2, and 4 hr of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBN was given 1 hr after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neocortical focal and perifocal ("penumbra") areas were sampled for analyses of phosphocreatine (PCr), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, ATP, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The penumbra showed a moderate-to-marked decrease and the focus showed a marked decrease in PCr and ATP concentrations, a decline in the sum of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, and an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration after 2 hr of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recirculation for 1 hr led to only a partial recovery of energy state, with little further improvement after 2 hr and signs of secondary deterioration after 4 hr, particularly in the focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4 hr of recirculation, PBN-treated animals showed pronounced recovery of energy state, with ATP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> contents in both focus and penumbra approaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although an effect of PBN on mitochondria cannot be excluded, the results suggest that PBN acts by preventing a gradual compromise of microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results justify a reevaluation of current views on the pathophysiology of focal ischemic damage and suggest that a therapeutic window of many hours exists in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
