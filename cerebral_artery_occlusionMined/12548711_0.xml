<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using microdialysis extraction of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> and concomitant recordings of extracellular direct current (DC) potentials, the effect of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was studied continuously over a period of 100 min in the cerebral cortex of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From analysis of the DC potentials, rats subjected to MCAO could be divided into three groups, one in which the dialysis probe was located in the ischemic core, one in which the probe was in the penumbra, and one in which the probe was in nonischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, extraction of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> was positively correlated with the DC potential; i.e., changes in the extraction were concurrent with changes in the DC potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparing the different animal groups by integration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extraction values obtained during MCAO over time, (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> extraction was reduced by 40% in the penumbra, and by 58% in the ischemic core, compared with the sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No changes was found in the nonischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra group, extraction of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> was reduced initially upon institution of MCAO but recovered to control-like levels over a period of 15-40 min, despite ongoing MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, extraction was reduced transiently during periinfarct depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mean of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extraction values obtained during MCAO in the penumbra group was reduced by 47% compared with a mean of values obtained before institution of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulted in a reduction of (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> extraction by 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present results provide direct evidence that uptake of Glu is reduced both in the ischemic core and in the penumbra of the cerebral cortex following MCAO in rats, possibly contributing to the initiation and spread of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results further indicate that uptake of Glu in the penumbra recovers to control-like levels, despite ongoing MCAO, providing evidence that Glu uptake by the Glu transporter proteins is reinstituted and/or up-regulated </plain></SENT>
