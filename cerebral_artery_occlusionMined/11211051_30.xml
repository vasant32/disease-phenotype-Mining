<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study provides experimental evidence for this beneficial role of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> using reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in a Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAo was induced in rats for 1 h followed by reperfusion at different periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) staining in normothermic (NT) 37 degrees C and hypothermic (HT) 33 degrees C groups of rats confirmed cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean per cent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was significantly reduced in the HT group of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was done using anti-Fas and caspase-3 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical expression of Fas and caspase-3 was demonstrable as early as 5 h after reperfusion, but the expression pattern maximized at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of Fas and caspase-3 proteins showed a clear decrease in the HT group over the NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ detection of DNA fragmentation was done using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling method (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were first observed at 5h after reperfusion and progressively increased by 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A higher number of TUNEL-positive cells was found in the NT group, but they were significantly decreased in the HT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, DNA fragmentation was confirmed by size fractionation in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a positive relation between the expression of Fas, caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells </plain></SENT>
