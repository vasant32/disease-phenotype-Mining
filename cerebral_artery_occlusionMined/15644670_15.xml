<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that treatment with hypertonic saline attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> associated with experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a well-characterized animal model of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we tested the hypotheses that lung water increases following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and determined the effects of osmotherapy with hypertonic saline and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> on total lung water, as well as on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Research laboratory in a university teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Adult male Wistar rats (300-450 g, n = 103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Under controlled conditions of normoxia, normocarbia, and normothermia, spontaneously breathing, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized (1.0-1.5%) rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by the intraluminal occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral perfusion was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry over ipsilateral parietal cortex to ensure adequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 hrs following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats were treated in a blinded randomized fashion with no intravenous fluids (n = 24), a continuous intravenous infusion (0.3 mL/hr) of 0.9% saline (n = 21), 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (2 g/Kg) (n = 20), 5% hypertonic saline (n = 20), or 7.5% hypertonic saline (n = 18) as a <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> mixture (50:50) until the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brains and lungs were harvested, and tissue water content was estimated by comparing wet-to-dry weight ratios of ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres at 48 hrs postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats served as controls (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum osmolality was determined at the end of the experiment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lung water content was increased significantly in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with no intravenous fluids (76.7 +/- 0.7%, 317 +/- 7 mOsm/L) (mean +/- sd) and saline (76.8 +/- 1.2%, 311 +/- 10 mOsm/L), compared with sham-operated controls (74.5 +/- 0.9%, 302 +/- 4 mOsm/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (74.4 +/- 1.2%, 352 +/- 15 mOsm/L), 5% hypertonic saline (75.6 +/- 1.3%, 339 +/- 16 mOsm/L), and 7.5% hypertonic saline (74.9 +/- 0.7%, 360 +/- 23 mOsm/L) significantly attenuated lung water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric brain water content increased both in the ipsilateral ischemic and contralateral hemispheres treated with saline (ipsilateral, 85.1 +/- 1.7%; contralateral, 80.7 +/- 0.7%), compared with sham-operated controls (ipsilateral, 79.6 +/- 0.9%; contralateral, 79.5 +/- 0.9%), as well as in rats that received no fluids (ipsilateral, 84.6 +/- 1.8%; contralateral, 80.4 +/- 0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 5% hypertonic saline (ipsilateral, 83.8 +/- 1.0%; contralateral, 79.7 +/- 0.6%) and 7.5% hypertonic saline (ipsilateral, 82.3 +/- 1.3%; contralateral, 78.6 +/- 0.7%) resulted in attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated increases in brain water content to a greater extent than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (ipsilateral, 83.6 +/- 1.6%; contralateral, 79.1 +/- 1.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a well-characterized animal model of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, total lung water content increases, which is likely neurogenic in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated increases in lung and brain water content with continuous infusion of hypertonic saline may have therapeutic implication in the treatment of cerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
