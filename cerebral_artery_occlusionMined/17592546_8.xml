<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that reparixin, a CXCL8 receptor blocker that inhibits neutrophil infiltration, and related molecules can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aims were to compare the effects of reparixin in transient and permanent MCAO using varied treatment schedules and therapeutic windows to evaluate effects on long-term neurological deficits and late <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reparixin, administered for 1 to 3 days, 3.5 to 6 h after MCAO, ameliorates neurological function recovery and inhibits long-term <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size reduction at 24 h, evaluated by TTC staining, is more pronounced in transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI analysis identified a decrease in the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by reparixin that was more evident at 48 h in permanent MCAO, and was associated with a significantly improved recovery from long-term neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
