<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have evaluated the upregulation of several genes associated with delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (c-fos, bax, and bcl-2) during the initial 24 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in the rat and the effects of postinjury treatment with the NR2B subunit specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CGX-1007 (Conantokin-G, Con-G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels peaked at 1 h postinjury in both cortical and subcortical ischemic brain regions (30-fold increase), remained elevated at 4 h and returned to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, preinjury levels 24 h postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels correlated to increased protein expression in the entire ipsilateral hemisphere at 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at 4 h were void of C-Fos immunoreactivity with continued upregulation in surrounding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, loss of C-Fos staining was observed in the injured hemisphere except for sustained increases along the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in the cingulate cortex of vehicle treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CGX-1007 treatment reduced c-fos expression throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region by up to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were measured in either bcl-2 or bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, at 24 h postinjury CGX-1007 treatment was associated with an increase in Bcl-2 immunoreactivity that correlated to a reduction in DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CGX-1007 effectively attenuated gene expression associated with delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as related to a neuroprotective relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
