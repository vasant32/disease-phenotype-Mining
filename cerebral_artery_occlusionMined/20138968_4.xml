<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the therapeutic effect of human serum albumin on VEGF expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the suture was withdrawn 2 h later, and 25% albumin (1.25 g/kg) or saline (5 ml/kg) was administered intravenously after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining, neurological deficits and brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum albumin level was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF expression was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that albumin administration maintained the serum albumin at a higher level than the sham group at 6 h, 1 d, 2 d and 3 d after MCAO, and significantly improved the neurological deficits and decreased the brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the strong up-regulation of VEGF expression at 6 h and 1d after MCAO can be attenuated by albumin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, albumin administration had no significant depressing effect on VEGF expression at 2 d, 3 d and 5 d after MCAO in the cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strong up-regulation of VEGF immunoreactivity was noted in the saline group in the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), and in neurons surrounding the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and periventricular area at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF in the albumin group was much weaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were high correlations between the brain water content with the serum albumin level, with serum VEGF protein level, and with brain VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, maintaining the serum albumin at a higher level, and attenuating endogenous VEGF expression at 6 h and 1d, but not 2 d, 3 d, or 5 d after MCAO, may partially contribute to the protective effects of albumin on reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
