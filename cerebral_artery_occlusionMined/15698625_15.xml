<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (LMWA), which reflect tissue reducing power, are among the endogenous mechanisms for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) was associated with decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on LMWA and on <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), a product of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> oxidation) in the brain, heart, liver, and lungs of rats subjected to 90 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> rats subjected to similar insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed for 90 min and at 0, 5, 30, 60, or 240 min of reperfusion, LMWA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) were evaluated by cyclic voltametry (CV) and radioimmunoassay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> was induced by 2 min of MCAO, 24 h prior to the major ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LMWA decreased at 5 min of reperfusion in the brain, heart, liver, and lung and rose 4 h later only in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels increased three to fivefold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> rats a dramatic increase of LMWA occurred at 5 min of reperfusion in the brain and in the peripheral organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">Uric acid</z:chebi>, but not ascorbic, is the major LMWA increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose that after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ROS rapidly consume the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> reserves in the brain and also in peripheral organs, suggesting that the whole body is under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, part of the neuroprotection afforded by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> is mediated by the brain's ability to mobilize <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, especially <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, that attenuate the massive ROS-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
