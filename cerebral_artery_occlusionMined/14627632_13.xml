<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory has shown previously that pretreatment with low physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protects against middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced brain injury during late phases of neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are induced by various forms of brain injury, and their induction is known to be a critical step in programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study tested the hypothesis that the ability of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> to reduce MCAO-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> involves attenuation of expression of one or more IEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of MCAO on the temporospatial pattern of IEG expression and the modulation of this pattern by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were ovariectomized and treated with either vehicle or low physiological concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One week later, rats underwent MCAO and brains were collected 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed IEG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in discrete regions of brain by RT-PCR at 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We examined expression of c-Fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in greater detail using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to delineate the time course and specific regions of cortex in which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> influenced its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that c-fos, fosB, c-jun, and junB levels were upregulated at 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> selectively affected the expression of c-Fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein by attenuating the injury-induced increase in a time- and region-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest that the ability of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> to protect against MCAO-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> involves attenuation of c-Fos induction </plain></SENT>
