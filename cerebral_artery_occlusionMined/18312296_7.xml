<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> modulates the anti-apoptotic signal through the activation of Akt and its downstream targets, FKHR, AFX, and 14-3-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and brain tissues were collected at 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential activation was measured by phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser(241), Akt at Ser(473), FKHR at Ser(256), and AFX at Ser(193) using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced reduction of pPDK1, pAkt, pFKHR, and pAFX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> did not affect the level of 14-3-3, which acts as an anti-apoptotic factor through interaction of pFKHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, the interaction of pFKHR and 14-3-3 increased, compared with that of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> plays a potent protective role against brain injury and that Akt activation and FKHR phosphorylation by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> mediated these protective effects </plain></SENT>
