<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) embolic occlusion is associated with a low rate of recanalization and poor outcome after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompt revascularization is required to prevent disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with tandem ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions treated with microcathether navigation and intra-arterial thrombolysis by use of collateral pathways including the posterior or anterior communicating arteries, or both pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 8 patients with proximal ICA occlusion associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolic occlusions treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IA rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Access to the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was obtained via catheter navigation through intact collateral pathways, including posterior communicating (PcomA) or anterior communicating (AcomA) arteries, without passing a microcathether through the acutely occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical outcomes using modified Rankin scale (mRS) and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with a mean age of 57 +/- 4 years and median NIHSS of 14 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to intra-arterial thrombolysis was 292 +/- 44 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was revascularized completely in 5 of the 8 patients via collateral intra-arterial rtPA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had a favorable outcome defined as a mRS of &lt; or =2 or more at 1 and 3 months' follow-up after thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had an asymptomatic petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small number of patients with tandem occlusions of the ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, intra-arterial thrombolysis and recanalization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> by use of collateral pathways to bypass the occluded ICA is a safe and efficacious therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
