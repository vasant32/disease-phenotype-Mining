<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, after 180 min of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the effect of pentastarch or albumin on blood-brain barrier permeability and cerebral injury was investigated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the following was maintained for the final 60 min of occlusion and throughout reperfusion: control-hematocrit was not manipulated; pentastarch-hematocrit was decreased to approximately 30% with pentastarch; or albumin-hematocrit was decreased (approximately 30%) with albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Part A (n = 21): 30 min of reperfusion was allowed, and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined with the indicator dye Evans Blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Part B (n = 14): in different animals, 120 min of reperfusion was allowed, and cerebral injury (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> stain) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (specific gravity) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Part C (n = 4): in different animals, the blood-brain barrier was evaluated by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evans Blue (micrograms per gram brain tissue, mean +/- SD) was greater in the control (20.8 +/- 9.0) and albumin (15.5 +/- 7.3) groups versus the pentastarch (4.7 +/- 2.7) group (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain injury (percent of hemisphere ipsilateral to occlusion) was less and specific gravity greater in the pentastarch (33 +/- 8 and 1.040 +/- 0.003 respectively) versus the albumin group (45 +/- 6 and 1.035 +/- 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports the hypothesis that during temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, pentastarch decreases brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
