<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been previously suggested that the transient ischemic depolarizations (IDs), thought involved in the gradual expansion of ischemic injury in the first hours following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), are akin to spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies indicate that the characteristics of these events are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (unlike those of SDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine whether different types of IDs exist or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using four cortical microelectrodes, we compared the spatial and the temporal characteristics of IDs that occur following intraluminal MCAo in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats to those of electrically induced SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An average 4.6+/-3.2 series of events, sequentially affecting the four electrodes, were recorded in 5 h following the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of ID duration disclosed two types: short IDs (&lt;7 min, 53% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events) and long IDs (&gt;7 min; 9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most long IDs occurred within the first 30 min and as the initial electrophysiological event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Later on and often restricted to a single or reduced number of recording sites, intermittent IDs were of reduced amplitude or even replaced entirely by suppressed electrocorticographic activity (38% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While the amplitude, duration and spreading characteristics were similar between short IDs and SDs provoked in the cortex of non-ischemic rats, those of long IDs were markedly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that two types of IDs exist and confirm that most IDs (short ones) are similar in nature to SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long IDs may represent a penumbral anoxic depolarization (AD), reversed by an improvement of perfusion, in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that intermittent blockade of depolarization waves occurs and that its incidence increases with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This blockade may reflect adaptive mechanisms which take place to prevent further depolarizations, the nature of which remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present description of electrophysiological abnormalities might have implications for anti-depolarization therapy in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to interpret the results of non-invasive techniques which enable the imaging of depolarized areas following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
