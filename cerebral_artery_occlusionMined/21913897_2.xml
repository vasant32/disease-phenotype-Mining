<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37991">Thienyl</z:chebi>-isoquinolone (TIQ-A) is a relatively potent PARP inhibitor able to reduce post-ischaemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have studied, in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models in vivo, the neuroprotective properties of DAMTIQ and HYDAMTIQ, two TIQ-A derivatives able to reach the brain and to inhibit PARP-1 and PARP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Studies were carried out in (i) transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO), (ii) permanent MCAO (pMCAO) and (iii) electrocoagulation of the distal portion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in conjunction with transient (90 min) bilateral carotid occlusion (focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: In male rats with tMCAO, HYDAMTIQ (0.1-10 mgÂ·kg(-1)) injected i.p. three times, starting 4 h after MCAO, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by up to 70%, reduced the loss of body weight by up to 60% and attenuated the neurological impairment by up to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In age-matched female rats, HYDAMTIQ also reduced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protection, however, was less pronounced than in the male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In animals with pMCAO, HYDAMTIQ administered 30 min after MCAO reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by approximately 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals with focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, HYDAMTIQ treatment decreased post-ischaemic accumulation of PAR (the product of PARP activity) and the presence of OX42-positive inflammatory cells in the ischaemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also reduced sensorimotor deficits for up to 90 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that HYDAMTIQ is a potent PARP inhibitor that conferred robust neuroprotection and long-lasting improvement of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
