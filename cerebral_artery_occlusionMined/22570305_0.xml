<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar Hannover rats were subjected to the right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 h </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes significant changes in SOD activities in the hippocampus and parietal cortex such as in GSH-Px activities in the parietal cortex, unilaterally and contralaterally to the lesion in rats during different reperfusion periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant activation of GSH-Px was registered neither in the right nor in the left hippocampus of ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
