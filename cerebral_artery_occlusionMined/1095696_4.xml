<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report a method for measuring total local brain tissue pressure (BTP) using a miniature catheter transducer stereotaxically introduced into the white matter of the cat's cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative rapid phasic pressure changes were satisfactorily demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to some drift of baseline of the transducers and inability to perform in vivo calibration, reliable long-term quantitative pressure measurements sometimes could not be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BTP from each cerebral hemisphere and the cisternal pressure (CP) were monitored during alterations of pCO-2 and systemic blood pressure, and distilled H20 injection prior to and after right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The catheter transducers functioned well on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> implantation for up to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the chronically implanted catheters, acutely implanted catheters responded identically except for drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response of intracranial pressure and CP to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, alterations in pCO2, and systemic blood pressure were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No BTP gradients appeared in response to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or progressive swelling of the resulting infarction </plain></SENT>
