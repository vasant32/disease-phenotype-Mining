<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism for the anti-ischemic activity of (S)-cis-verbenol remains unclear yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, (S)-cis-verbenol reduced cerebral ischemic injury caused by 1.5-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (S)-cis-verbenol significantly prevented neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD, 1 h) and subsequent re-oxygenation (5 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While (S)-cis-verbenol did not inhibit the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-stimulated calcium influx, it reduced the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevated by OGD/re-oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ORAC assay indicated that (S)-cis-verbenol potently eliminated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25935">peroxyl radicals</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In DPPH and DHR123 fluorescence assays, however, (S)-cis-verbenol did not show a direct ROS scavenging effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (S)-cis-verbenol reduced the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ischemic brain and immunostimulated glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that (S)-cis-verbenol may be a useful therapeutic agent due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities </plain></SENT>
