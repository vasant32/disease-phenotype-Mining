<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was followed by 2, 4 and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> and ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some areas tissue pH reached the threshold of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27510">umbelliferone</z:chebi> method (about pH 6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas with ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were significantly smaller than regions of pH alteration not only at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but during the first 4 hours of recirculation as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 4 hours of reperfusion large areas with altered pH were associated with ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in smaller regions, mostly in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas of ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were acidic initially, but by 4 hours alkaline pH could also be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> alkaline areas (pH &gt; 7.4) were found with ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, suggesting irreversible tissue damage, in cortical areas, in the hippocampus, and in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 24 hours of reperfusion there was no significant difference between the size of areas with altered pH and ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
