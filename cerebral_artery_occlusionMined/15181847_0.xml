<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to use urokinase (UK) in combination with batroxobin in thrombolytic therapy so as to see whether batroxobin(DF-521) would be effective for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in male SD rats was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>120 rats were randomized into 9 groups, namely control group, sham control group, and groups that were treated with batroxobin and urokinase together or separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each group comprised 15 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>Intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume ratio and neurological function were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>Intracranial bleeding</z:mp> was found in 5 rats of the UK 5000 U/kg group, in 4 rats of the UK 5000 U/kg (2 h) + DF-521 5 BU/kg (2 h) group, and in only 1 rat of the UK 5000 U/kg (2 h) + DF-521 5 BU/kg (1 h) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume ratio was obviously reduced in 5 BU/kg batroxobin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in neurological deficit scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 5000 U/kg urokinase increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Batroxobin either used separately or in combination with urokinase would not increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
