<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limitations in penumbra detection with mismatch are recognized, with a lack of consensus on thresholds, quantification and validation of mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined perfusion and diffusion thresholds from final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the clinically relevant spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone (SHRSP) rat and its normotensive control strain, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and compared three methods for penumbra calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (WKY n=12, SHRSP n=15), diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) images were obtained for 4 hours post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> determined at 24 hours on T(2) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PWI/DWI mismatch was calculated from volumetric assessment (perfusion deficit volume minus apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>)-defined lesion volume) or spatial assessment of mismatch area on each coronal slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-derived lesion growth provided the third, retrospective measure of penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 hour after MCAO, volumetric mismatch detected smaller volumes of penumbra in both strains (SHRSP: 31 ± 50 mm(3), WKY: 22 ± 59 mm(3), mean ± s.d.) compared with spatial assessment (SHRSP: 36 ± 15 mm(3), WKY: 43 ± 43 mm(3)) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion expansion (SHRSP: 41 ± 45 mm(3), WKY: 65 ± 41 mm(3)), although these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spatial assessment appears most informative, using both diffusion and perfusion data, eliminating the influence of negative mismatch and allowing the anatomical location of penumbra to be assessed at given time points after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
