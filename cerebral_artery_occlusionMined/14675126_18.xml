<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in vivo in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion/reperfusion surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> was administered twice (6.0 mg/kg, p.o.) just prior to 1 hr of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 1 day after the surgery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the saline-treated control rats, increases in T2-weighted signals (water content) were clearly observed in the striatum and in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
