<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 has potent neuroprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat and sheep model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether it has neuroprotective effects on brain insult in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as one part of serial subhuman primate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research, the present study was designed to observe whether IGF-1 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein is expressed in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in monkeys and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 12,800 dots complementary DNA microarray, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complementary DNA microarray showed that among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined was affected after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury especially in the growth factor family including IGF-1 in the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decreased IGF-1 mRNA and protein expression was found in the insular striatum, but there was an increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and unchanged protein expression in the hippocampus 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that IGF-1 might contribute to the neuroprotective pathway in a pattern different from that of rats, and it might play a role in protection of ischemic injured neuronal cells after monkey focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
