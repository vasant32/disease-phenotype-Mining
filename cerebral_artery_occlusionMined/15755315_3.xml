<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pinokalant (LOE 908 MS) is a novel broad-spectrum inhibitor of several subtypes of such channels and has previously been shown to improve the metabolic and electrophysiologic status of the ischemic penumbra and to reduce lesion size on magnetic resonance images in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether these beneficial effects of pinokalant are translated into permanent neuroprotection in terms of a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size one week after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusions started 30 min. after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were continued for 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body temperature and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored by telemetry during this period and the spontaneous temperature after course in control rats established in other experiments was imitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days later histological brain sections were prepared and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body temperature did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure was slightly higher in the pinokalant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pinokalant treatment significantly reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 33.8+/-15.8 mm3 to 24.5+/-13.1 mm3 (control group versus pinokalant group, P=0.017, t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taking the effective drug plasma concentration established in other experiments into account revealed that in rats with plasma concentrations within the therapeutic interval, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were further reduced to 17.9+/-7.5 mm3 (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
