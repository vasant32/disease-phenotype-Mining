<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), Natrii sulfas was administered after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 3, 6, 15, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion, the physiological indices such as the fecal weight, urine volume and water content in the stools were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> index was measured 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours, the expressions of iNOS, MMP9, VEGF, GFAP, Bax, Bcl-2, c-Fos, and HSP72 positive astrocytes were observed on the brain tissues by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Natrii sulfas significantly improved the decrease in fecal weight, urine volume and water content in the stool caused by the ischemic insult (p &lt; 0.05) and attenuated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> insult (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Natrii sulfas significantly down-regulated iNOS and MMP9 expressions and attenuated the astrocyte swelling due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in the penumbra of the cerebral cortex of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Natrii sulfas reduced the excess Bax and HSP72 expressions in ischemic brain, which was statistically significant in the penumbra of the cerebral cortex but not in the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest Natrii sulfas has a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and improves the physiological symptoms </plain></SENT>
