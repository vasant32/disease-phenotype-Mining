<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Employing the transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) models of unilateral brain injury, the aim was to elucidate immunolocalization of HO-1 and HO-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 3 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were utilized to determine HO-1 and HO-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral hemisphere following HI, HO-1 immunoreactivity was significantly upregulated in many neuronal and glial populations (including the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HO-1 was also detected in macrophages/microglia within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to widespread neuronal HO-2 labelling, HO-2 was also expressed in vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cells within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of MCAO and HI animals were surprisingly immunoreactive for HO-2, but only HI animals had significantly elevated HO-2 protein expression in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the presence of global <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the HI model which can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and subsequent proliferation of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report of HO-2 protein expression upregulation following HI coupled with an increase in HO-1 immunoreactivity suggests that this response may be implicated in reducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or repairing damage induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
