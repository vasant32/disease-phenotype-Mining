<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 (125 mg/kg bolus followed by 125 mg/kg/h) was infused for 4 h 45 min starting 15 min after right pMCAO or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 5 h, there was a similar plasma total NXY-059 concentration (micromol/L) in both groups [sham: 623 +/- 44 (6); pMCAO: 605 +/- 43 (5)] and a similar drug concentration (nmol/g) in the right cortex [sham: 6.92 +/- 1.05 (6); pMCAO: 6.14 +/- 2.18 (6)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subsequent experiment in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, infusing NXY-059 at both a similar and higher concentration (252 mg/kg bolus and 252 mg/kg/h), demonstrated that the concentration of NXY-059 in cortex increased linearly with respect to the plasma concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that NXY-059 does penetrate brain tissue in control animals and ischemic tissue of animals subjected to pMCAO </plain></SENT>
