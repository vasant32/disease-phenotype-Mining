<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the past 7 years, 104 patients prospectively underwent superselective local angiography via a microcatheter before and during intra-arterial reperfusion therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to evaluate the presence or absence of early venous filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In principle, reperfusion therapy was discontinued just after appearance of early venous filling for fear of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 2 types of early venous filling: early filling of the thalamostriate vein from the lenticulostriate arteries and that of the cortical vein from the cortical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among these 104 patients, 31 (29.8%) had early venous filling: 19 had early filling of the thalamostriate vein, and the other 12 had early filling of the cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 19 patients (42.1%) and 2 of the 12 patients (16.7%) had massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with neurological worsening, whereas only 1 of the 73 patients (1.4%) without early venous filling had massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between early venous filling and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in both the deep (P&lt;0.0001) and superficial (P=0.0019) middle cerebral artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the presence of early venous filling as an indicator of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> were 71% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the 31 ischemic areas with early venous filling could escape <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Appearance of early venous filling may indicate irreversible brain damage and may be a predictive sign for parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
