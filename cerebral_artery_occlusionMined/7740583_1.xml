<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We demonstrated in a previous study that 45Ca accumulation in the lateral part of the striatum was detected 3 days after distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using a 45Ca autoradiographic technique in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of delayed neuronal damage that occurred in the lateral part of the striatum is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined changes in amino acids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> in the striatums of rat brains after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats using an in vivo brain microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microdialysis probes were inserted into the lateral or medial part of the striatum 24 hours before the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dialysis probe was perfused continuously at 2 microL/min with Ringer's solution, and the dialysate samples were collected every 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 3-hour period for baseline stabilization, the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dialysate count of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> and amino acids was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, a threefold transient increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was observed in the lateral part of the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level returned to its baseline value 60 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> in the lateral part increased twofold to its peak value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This release persisted for 2 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in these components in the extracellular fluid of the medial part of the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that changes of <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> in the lateral part of the striatum after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion differed from those in the medial part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that excessive release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> is related to delayed neuronal damage that occurs in the lateral part of the striatum in this model </plain></SENT>
