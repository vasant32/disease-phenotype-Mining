<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To end up with a restorative therapeutic treatment, it is crucial to get the cell transplants to the site of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated the feasibility of small animal SPECT/CT in assessing the definite accumulation of (111)In-oxine-labeled human embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived neural progenitors and rat hippocampal progenitors after intravenous or intra-arterial administration (femoral vein vs. common carotid artery) in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell detection was carried out immediately and 24h after the infusion using a SPECT/CT device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that after intravenous injections both cell types accumulated primarily into internal organs, instead of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after intra-arterial injection, a weak signal was detected in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional studies showed that the detection sensitivity of SPECT/CT device was approximately 1000 (111)In-oxine-labeled cells and labeling did not affect the cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a small animal SPECT is powerful technique to study the whole body biodistribution of cell-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that intravenous administration is not an optimal route to deliver neural progenitor cell-containing transplants into the brain after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
