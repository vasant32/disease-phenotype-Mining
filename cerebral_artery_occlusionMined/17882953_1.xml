<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury induced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyethylpuerarin (10, 20, 40 mg x kg(-1), iv) was administered just 30 min before occlusion and immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 24 h reperfusion following 2 h of MCAO, the number of viable neurons in hippocampal CA1 region was counted by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha protein and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were examined with radioimmunoassay (RIA) and reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF-KB activity was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and inhibition of NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha) protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with hydroxyethylpuerarin had a significant increase in neuronal survival in comparison with vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyethylpuerarin significantly reduced the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TNF-alpha following 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and the degradation of IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm also decreased by hydroxyethylpuerarin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of hydroxyethylpuerarin against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury may be mediated by decreasing the expression of TNF-alpha and the activity of NF-kappaB in rats </plain></SENT>
