<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized adult cats underwent exposure of the common carotid arteries bilaterally and the right middle cerebral artery through a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline NMRI images were obtained with a single spin-echo, multislice technique using a 0.6-T field, 0.4-cm slice thickness, and a surface coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced with right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and potentiated with bilateral common carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential NMRI studies were then performed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours or until CBF was determined in the same cats using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine at either 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 2), 6 (n = 2), or 12 (n = 1) hours after the time of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This protocol allowed temporal and spatial correlation of NMRI and CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternate 5-mm brain slices were incubated with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) for 45 minutes at 37-41 degrees C and frozen in liquid Freon for later autoradiographic CBF determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cats were studied only with NMRI and TTC (not CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between areas of increased NMRI signal intensity observed in T2-weighted images (repetition time 2,000 msec, echo time 120 msec), vital staining with TTC, low CBF, and routine histology was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the early phase (less than 6 hours), T2-weighted NMRI changes were localized to the central ischemic gray matter areas, as defined in the later CBF images, with no involvement of the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By the twelfth hour the NMRI changes involved the entire ischemic area including gray and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The initial visible changes seen on T2-weighted NMRI are suggestive of cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and the later changes are characteristic of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The spread of NMRI changes compared with the ischemic area determined from autoradiographic CBF is consistent with the previously described biphasic evolution of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that T2-weighted NMRI could be used clinically to delineate areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
