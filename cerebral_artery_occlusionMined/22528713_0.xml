<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rate of early complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS) should not exceed 3% in asymptomatic and 6% in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some recent studies/registries failed to reach this threshold, fueling a debate on the role of CAS in the treatment of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate 30-day safety of CAS using different embolic protection devices and different stent types according to the tailored-CAS algorithm and to identify risk factors for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2002 and 2010, we performed 1176 CAS procedures in 1081 patients (age 38-86 years, mean 66.3 Â± 8.4 years, 51.5% symptomatic) according to the tailored-CAS algorithm that included extracranial ultrasound and computed tomography angiography to select the most appropriate embolic protection device (EPD) and stent type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal EPD and closed-cell (CC) stents were preferentially used for high-risk lesions (HR - soft/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-containing/tight/ulcerated, 36.14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions) and in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success rate was 99.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients, proportion of HR lesions was higher (41.1%) than in the asymptomatic group (30.8%, p = 0.001) and the usage of CC stents (76.2% vs 71.7%, p = 0.103) and proximal EPD (P-EPD, 34.8% vs 27.7% among asymptomatic patients, p = 0.010) was more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CC stents were used in 82.4% of CAS procedures involving HR lesions (vs 69.1% for non-HR lesions, p &lt; 0.01), and P-EPD were used in 83.1% of procedures involving HR lesions (vs 2.5% for non-HR lesions, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications included 6 (0.55%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 1 (0.08%) major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 19 (1.61%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (MI) were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 7 (0.59%) cases of hyperperfusion syndrome, 2 were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day complication rate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/MI) was 2.38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; 75 years was a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.015), and prior neurological symptoms were a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 4 cases of periprocedural embolic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated with combined intracranial mechanical and local thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAS with EPD and stent type selection on the basis of thorough non-invasive diagnostic work-up (tailored- -CAS) is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Advanced age was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the presence of prior neurological symptoms was a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With the tailored-CAS approach, high-risk lesion features (soft/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>- -containing/tight/ulcerated) are eliminated as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion syndrome is a severe CAS complication which may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo>, iatrogenic embolic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is rare and may be managed by combined intracranial mechanical and local thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
