<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of pinocembrin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-like insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection by pinocembrin was studied at the in vivo level using a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pinocembrin was administrated at the start of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pinocembrin markedly increased rat viability, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological deficit scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neuronal cultures were subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation/reoxygenation, a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-like injury, and treated with pinocembrin at the start of reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal survival rates were increased, LDH release was decreased and both neurite length and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were alleviated when pinocembrin was present during reoxygenation, and this protection was associated with the reduction of reactive oxygen species, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS), and an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DNA laddering was decreased in treatment groups of pinocembrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 protein was down-regulated and PARP degradation was alleviated after pinocembrin treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that pinocembrin may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury, and may act by the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
