<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated which neuronal element in FN, perikarya or axons, mediates this central neurogenic neuroprotection and whether it also protects against excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In anesthetized rats, the FN was stimulated for 1 hr, and ibotenic acid (IBO) was microinjected unilaterally into the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In unstimulated controls, the excitotoxic lesions averaged approximately 40 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of FN, but not dentate nucleus (DN), significantly reduced lesion volumes up to 80% when IBO was injected 15 min, 72 hr, or 10 d, but not 30 d, thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other rats, intrinsic neurons of FN or DN were destroyed by pretreatment with IBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five days later, the FN was stimulated, and 72 hr later, IBO was microinjected into the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions of FN, but not DN, abolished neuroprotection but not the elevations of rCBF and AP elicited from FN stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxic lesions of FN, but not DN, also abolished the 37% reduction in focal ischemic infarctions produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excitation of intrinsic FN neurons provides long-lasting, substantial, and reversible protection of central neurons from excitotoxicity, as well as focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas axons in the nucleus, probably collaterals of ramified brainstem neurons, mediate the elevations in rCBF, which do not contribute to neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-lived protection against a range of injuries is an unrecognized function of FN neurons transmitted over pathways distinct from those regulating rCBF </plain></SENT>
