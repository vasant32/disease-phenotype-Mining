<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> receptors (NMDARs) are responsible for the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, nerve growth factor (NGF) is critically involved in cell survival and neuroprotective effects via the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to produce beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of EA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that EA treatment reversed the high expression of NR1 subunit and up-regulated the level of TrkA in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> of specific intracellular signaling pathways, we found that the neuroprotective effects of EA appear to be mediated by stimulation of the PI3-K pathway, but not ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may provide important experimental evidence for the clinical application of EA treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
