<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the PDE5A inhibitor 3-(4-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44730">2-hydroxyethyl</z:chebi>)piperazin-1-yl)-7-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-1-(2-propoxyethyl)pyrido[3,4-b]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazin</z:chebi>-2(1H)-one <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (PF-5) to determine the timing, duration, and degree of inhibition that yields maximum efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the localization of PDE5A to determine the tissues and cells that would be targets for PDE5 inhibition and that may mediate efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly complete inhibition of PDE5A, starting 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-o and continued for 7 days, resulted in nearly complete recovery of sensorimotor function that was sustained for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delaying administration until 72 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-o resulted in equivalent efficacy, whereas delaying treatment for 14 days was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment for 7 days was equivalently efficacious to 28 or 84 days of treatment, whereas treatment for 1 day was less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> forebrain, PDE5A immunoreactivity was prominent in smooth muscle of meningeal arteries and a few smaller blood vessels, with weak staining in a few widely scattered cortical neurons and glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 and 48 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-o, the number and intensity of blood vessel staining increased in the infarcted cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PDE5A immunoreactivity also was increased at 48 h in putative microglia in penumbra, whereas there was no change in staining of the scattered cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the window for efficacy and the PDE5A distribution, we hypothesize that efficacy results from an effect on vasculature, and perhaps modulation of microglial function, both of which may facilitate recovery of neuronal function </plain></SENT>
