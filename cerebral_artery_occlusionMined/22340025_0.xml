<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only approved medical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is early IV tissue plasminogen activator administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, while some patients do not benefit from quick recanalization, others recover despite persistent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wondered whether there are different effects of tissue plasminogen activator treatment on large artery and small artery reopening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 55 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who showed persisting middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> evidenced by transcranial colour-coded duplex ultrasonography in follow-up examination within 48 h postonset of middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes (mean 30·8 ± 5·4 h after admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 55 had been treated with tissue plasminogen activator and 33/55 had been treated without tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared neurological (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) and functional (modified Rankin Scale) scores at baseline, after seven-days, and then after two-months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis, as well as clinical baseline characteristics were analysed to exclude significant differences between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite later admission to hospital (tissue plasminogen activator patients 1·6 ± 0·66 h vs. non-tissue plasminogen activator patients 7·4 ± 5·84 h; P &lt; 0·001), there was no significant difference between both groups concerning demographic data, severity of symptoms on admission, risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis, as well as basic laboratory values (international normalized ratio, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein) blood pressure and body temperature on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of Doppler findings demonstrating persistent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 55 patients, there was a significant neurological and functional improvement in tissue plasminogen activator patients compared to non-tissue plasminogen activator patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator patients had a mean improvement on National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale within the first seven-days of 2·8 points, while non-tissue plasminogen activator patients deteriorated by 2·2 points (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concerning modified Rankin Scale tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients showed a mean improvement within the first seven-days of 0·5 points, while non-tissue plasminogen activator patients deteriorated by 0·3 points (P = 0·019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A favourable overall short-term clinical course (i.e. improvement on National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale &gt;3 points and/or modified Rankin Scale &gt;1 point) was found in 36·4% of tissue plasminogen activator patients and in 6·1% of non-tissue plasminogen activator patients (P = 0·0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At two-months follow-up, patients still showed a median modified Rankin Scale of 4 points after tissue plasminogen activator treatment and 5 points after non-tissue plasminogen activator treatment (P = 0·023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the prognosis of patients with persisting middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after tissue plasminogen activator administration is known to be poor, patients do better if treated with tissue plasminogen activator vs. those who could not be treated - mainly for late presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This may be due to sufficient small vascular territory recanalization despite persistence of large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after tissue plasminogen activator treatment </plain></SENT>
