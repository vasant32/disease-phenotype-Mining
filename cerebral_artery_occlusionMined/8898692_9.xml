<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is accumulated into cells through an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> cotransporter (SMIT) that is regulated by extracellular tonicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of SMIT in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we examined expression of SMIT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the rat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which would reflect alteration of extracellular tonicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of SMIT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was markedly increased 12 h after surgery in the cortex of the affected side and lasted until the second day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased expression was also found in the contralateral cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-regulated expression was found predominantly in the neurons in remote areas, although nonneuronal cells adjacent to the ischemic core also expressed this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes extensive osmotic stress in brain and that the neuronal cells respond to this stress by increasing SMIT expression </plain></SENT>
