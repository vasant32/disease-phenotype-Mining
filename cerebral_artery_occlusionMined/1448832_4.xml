<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> associated with blood-brain barrier permeability changes and the excess production of free radicals are serious complications in prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy of transvenous perfusion of the brain, starting treatment 5 hours after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for a period of 2 hours in rats with the combined agents <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (10 ml/2 hr) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (1 mg/2 hr) to counter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (0.05 mg/kg/2 hr) for vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In experiment 1, blood-brain barrier permeability changes were examined in five groups with six rats each: group C rats underwent 7 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with no treatment; group V, treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> alone; group VD, treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>; group VM, treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>; and group VDM, treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, we examined local cerebral blood flow, ischemic tissue damage volume, and water content of cerebral hemispheres in two groups of 16 rats each subjected to the same treatment as groups C and VDM rats in experiment 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of blood-brain barrier permeability changes in the ischemic cortex of rats in group VDM compared with rats in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group undergoing transvenous perfusion of the brain with the three combined agents, there was a significant improvement of cerebral blood flow (39-58%, p &lt; 0.05) in the ischemic cortex and reduction of ischemic cerebral damage volume (22%, p &lt; 0.01) and water content of the ischemic hemisphere (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic approach using combined agents is effective treatment when initiated within 5 hours of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
