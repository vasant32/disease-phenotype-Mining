<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We are currently investigating microglial activation and neuronal precursor cell (NPC) proliferation after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed: (1) to investigate differences in hippocampal NPC proliferation in outbred male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Sprague-Dawley rats (SDs) one week after tMCAo; (2) to present the practical use of the optical fractionator and 2D nucleator in stereological brain tissue analyses; and (3) to report our experiences with an intraluminal tMCAo model where the occluding filament is advanced 22 mm beyond the carotid bifurcation and the common carotid artery is clamped during tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three SDs and twenty SHRs were randomized into four groups subjected to 90 minutes tMCAo or sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BrdU (50 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally twice daily on Day 4 to 7 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NeuN-stained tissue sections were used for brain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume estimation with the 2D nucleator and Cavalieri principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brains were studied for the presence of activated microglia (ED-1) and hippocampal BrdU incorporation using the optical fractionator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no significant difference or increase in post-ischemic NPC proliferation between the two strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the response to remote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may differ between SDs and SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three animals increased post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> NPC proliferation was associated with hippocampal ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 89.2 +/- 76.1 mm3 in SHRs and 16.9 +/- 22.7 mm3 in SDs (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight out of eleven SHRs had ischemic neocortical damage in contrast to only one out of 12 SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We observed involvement of the anterior choroidal and hypothalamic arteries in several animals from both strains and the anterior cerebral artery in two SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an early hippocampal NPC proliferation one week after tMCAo in both strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Infarction within the anterior choroidal artery could induce hippocampal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and increase NPC proliferation profoundly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NPC proliferation was not aggravated by the presence of activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal tMCAo in SHRs gave a more reliable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with neocortical involvement, but affected territories supplied by the anterior cerebral, anterior choroidal and hypothalamic arteries </plain></SENT>
