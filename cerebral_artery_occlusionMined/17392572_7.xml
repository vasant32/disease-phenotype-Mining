<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Theaflavin, a major constituent of black tea, possesses biological functions such as the antioxidative, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to verify whether theaflavin reduces focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and subjected to 2 hours of MCAO followed 24 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Theaflavin administration (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i.v.) ameliorated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Theaflavin inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> and expression of ICAM-1, COX-2, and iNOS in injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of STAT-1, a protein which mediates intracellular signaling to the nucleus, was enhanced 2-fold over that of sham group and was inhibited by theaflavin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that theaflavin significantly protected neurons from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury by limiting <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> and expression of ICAM-1, and suppressing upregulation of inflammatory-related prooxidative enzymes (iNOS and COX-2) in ischemic brain via, at least in part, reducing the phosphorylation of STAT-1 </plain></SENT>
