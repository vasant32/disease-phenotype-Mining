<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> followed by 24 h of reoxygenation induced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a marker of cell membrane damage, in cultured neurons and glia derived from rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SM-20220 significantly reduced LDH release in both cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was statistically significant at concentrations of more than 10(-8) mol/l for neurons and 10(-7) mol/l for glia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standard NHE inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi>, also reduced LDH release in neurons at concentrations of more than 10(-7) mol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, intravenous infusion of SM-20220 reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> when the serum concentration of SM- 20220 was maintained at about 10(-7) mol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the activation of the NHE plays an important role in ischemic neuronal and glial cell injury, and NHE inhibitor may have good therapeutic value for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
