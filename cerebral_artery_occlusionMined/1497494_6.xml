<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has seldom been considered in experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occur in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 57 male Wistar rats in three age groups: 47 to 70 days old (juvenile), 110 to 152 days old (young adult), and 186 to 245 days old (mature adult), each group being subdivided into experimental and sham operation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats underwent occlusion or sham occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and monitoring of the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, sympathetic nerve activity, plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels, and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 rats in the oldest group died within 6 hours of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; of these, the youngest was 186 days old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mature adult rats that died before completion of the experiment showed the highest level of sympathetic nerve activity and the only significant increase in the QT interval of the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, sympathetic nerve activity increased in the young adult rats but most strikingly in the mature adult rats that died before the end of the 6-hour experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated at 4 and 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the oldest group and only at 6 hours in the juvenile rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study are consistent with impaired sympathetic and cardiovascular regulation in the mature adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High sympathetic activity may represent one mechanism leading to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age-related impairment of sympathetic regulation may contribute to the higher mortality seen among elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
