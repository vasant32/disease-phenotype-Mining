<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to elucidate biochemical and histopathological alternations in TDP-43 specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and solubility of TDP-43 by immunoblottings and histopathological examinations using the ischemic and sham-operated cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of full-length TDP-43 (43 kDa) decreased and that of the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which can be explained by proteolytic cleavage of TDP-43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic redistribution and altered nuclear distribution of TDP-43 was observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, whereas abnormal phosphorylation and insolubilization of TDP-43 as well as formation of intracellular inclusions were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neurons with the cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43 expressed ubiquitin and activated caspase 3 and were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, biochemical and histopathological alterations in TDP-43 were identified in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, although there was very less similarity between TDP-43 alterations observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and those observed in TDP-43 proteinopathy </plain></SENT>
