<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We investigated axonal plasticity in the bilateral motor cortices and the long term therapeutic effect of Niaspan on axonal remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type-1 diabetic (T1DM) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES: T1DM was induced in young adult male Wistar rats via injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T1DM rats were subjected to 2h transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and were treated with 40 mg/kg Niaspan or saline starting 24 h after MCAo and daily for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anterograde tracing using biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> (BDA) injected into the contralateral motor cortex was performed to assess axonal sprouting in the ipsilateral motor cortex area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome, SMI-31 (a pan-axonal microfilament marker), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver and synaptophysin expression were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies using primary cortical neuron (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi>) cultures and in vivo BDA injection into the brain to anterogradely label axons and terminals were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in T1DM-MCAo rats significantly improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and increased SMI-31, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver and synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared to saline treated T1DM-MCAo rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using BDA to anterograde label axons and terminals, Niaspan treatment significantly increased axonal density in ipsilateral motor cortex in T1DM-MCAo rats (p&lt;0.05, n=7/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Niacin treatment of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi> significantly increased Ang1 expression under high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Niacin and Ang1 significantly increased neurite outgrowth, and anti-Ang1 antibody marginally attenuated Niacin induced neurite outgrowth (p=0.06, n=6/group) in cultured <z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi> under high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Niaspan treatment increased ischemic brain Ang1 expression and promoted axonal remodeling in the ischemic brain as well as improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ang1 may partially contribute to Niaspan-induced axonal remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in T1DM-rats </plain></SENT>
