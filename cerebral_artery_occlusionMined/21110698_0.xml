<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a specific marker of astrocytes, which is thought to be essential for neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify the relationship between hypoxic tissue and astrocytes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were randomly divided into a 1.5-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion(1.5-hour IR) group and a permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (PI) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic tissue and GFAP fluorescence intensity in the ischemic cortex were observed postoperatively on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that hypoxic tissue was present from day 1 to 14 in the 1.5-hour IR group and on days 1 and 3 in the PI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GFAP fluorescence intensity in the 1.5-hour IR group was stronger than that in the PI group at the same time point of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over time, GFAP expression increased and peaked at 7 days in each group, followed by a decrease in signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In hypoxic tissue, the GFAP fluorescence intensity was stronger than that in the surrounding tissue at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observation time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that astrocytes were strongly activated in hypoxic tissue induced by temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The activation of astrocytes may partially contribute to the survival and repair of hypoxic tissue following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
