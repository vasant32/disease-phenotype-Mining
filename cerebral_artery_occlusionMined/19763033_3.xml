<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each: sham operation plus vehicle (Sham), middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus vehicle (MCAO), MCAO plus low dose soybean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> (10 mg/(kg.d)) and MCAO plus high dose soybean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> (50 mg/(kg.d)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vehicle (saline, 10 mL/(kg.d)) and soybean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> were administered by gastric lavage for 28 d prior to sham or MCAO operation and for 7 d afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of components of the Notch signaling system (Notch1 and Hes5) were measured by in situ hybridization and western blotting, respectively, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was quantified by TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MCAO stimulated expression of Notch1 and Hes5, at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, and also <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soybean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> dose-dependently augmented the stimulatory effect of MCAO on Notch1 and Hes5 expression levels but <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results identify a possible mechanism by which soybean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> confers neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
