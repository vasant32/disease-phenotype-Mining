<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 is a protooncogene that plays a major antiapoptotic role, at the cellular level, by counteracting the activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> effectors, that is, caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (NTG), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced brain damage via the inhibition of caspase activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we evaluated the protective effects of NTG against cerebral damage caused by transient (2h) MCAo (tMCAo) focusing our interest on the potential effects on Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) with NTG (10mg/kg) or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>, 1ml/kg) 20min before the induction of MCAo by intraluminal silicon-coated filament (0.37-mm diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured 22h after reperfusion, while cortical Bcl-2 expression was evaluated at the end of 2-h MCAo (without reperfusion) and at 5h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show significant reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats preinjected with NTG, as compared to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2h of occlusion, no significant difference was seen in Bcl-2 expression in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex of either experimental groups (NTG and vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 5h after reperfusion, a significant increase of Bcl-2 expression was detected in the damaged cortex of control rats, probably reflecting a compensatory response aiming at counteracting the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> process; this increase was absent in the NTG-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data, while confirming the neuroprotective effect of NTG in an in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion model, seem to suggest that the drug may act by downsizing the complex chain of events underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> activation and consequent activation of antiapoptotic responses </plain></SENT>
