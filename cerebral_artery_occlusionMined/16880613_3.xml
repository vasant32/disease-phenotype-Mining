<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of the methanolic extract of B. officinalis (BOME) and of its <z:chebi fb="17" ids="29021">hexane</z:chebi> fraction (BOHF) were investigated in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo, 120 min occlusion, 24 h reperfusion) Sprague-Dawley rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BOME or BOHF (100 mg/kg, p.o.) was twice administered 30 min before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo and 2 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BOME and BOHF treated groups showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes reduced by 33.9% and 68.2%, respectively, at 2 h occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BOHF treated animals, cyclooxygenase-2 and iNOS inductions were inhibited in ischemic hemispheres at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that BOME and BOHF both inhibited LPS-induced nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production in BV-2 mouse microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory and the microglial activation inhibitory effects of B. officinalis extract may contribute to its neuroprotective effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
