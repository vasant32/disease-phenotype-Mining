<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in branches of their <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following diagnostic angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received microballoon angioplasty and various combinations of IA alteplase (rtPA), abciximab, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two also underwent stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive retrospective review of the patients' records was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' NIHSS scores were reassessed before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was evaluated by angiography after treatment and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was successfully performed in 7 patients without treatment-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients received distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> angioplasty as a secondary intervention: 1 following failed treatment with a Merci retriever and the other after successful removal of proximal clot with a Merci retriever </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient did not recover from the initial ischemic event despite an excellent angiographic result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization (modified TIMI grade 4) was achieved in 4 patients and near-complete recanalization with mild flow deficit (modified TIMI grade 3), in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with a microballoon is safe and effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This case series demonstrates that endovascular treatment beyond the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation can dramatically reverse neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
