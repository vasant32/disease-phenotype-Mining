<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis is regulated by a number of signaling pathways, including the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) pathway, a key regulator of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture has been used to treat neurological conditions and is known to potentially enhance cell proliferation in the neurogenic area (hippocampal dentate gyrus and the SVZ of the lateral ventricle walls) in pathological conditions, which is associated with improved brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether or not the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) are mediated by the regulation of the RA signaling pathway remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, in the present study we evaluated the effect of EA on the neurological functional recovery, infarction volume and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and sixteen SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, model group (ischemic rats without EA stimulation) and EA group (ischemic rats with EA stimulation on ST36 and LI11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral deficits were detected with high-resolution digital analysis of 24-h home-cage video recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> staining and the expression of RA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was measured using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that EA decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, promoted neurological functional recovery and increased the RA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings of this study suggest that promoting neurological functional recovery by modulating RA expression in the post-ischemic brain is one of the mechanisms by which EA can be effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
