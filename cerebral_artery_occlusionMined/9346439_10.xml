<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 24 hours were subjected to immediate or 8-hour delayed 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining (n = 8 at each time point); the other 8 animals were subjected to immediate or 8-hour delayed measurement of succinate dehydrogenase activity (n = 4 at each time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TTC staining was of good quality good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, and the infarcted region could be distinguished easily from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between the two groups (263.8 +/- 43.1 versus 264.4 +/- 54.8 mm3 [mean +/- standard deviation]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of succinate dehydrogenase was not significantly different when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or infarcted tissue was measured immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or with an 8 hour delay, although less activity was detected at both time points in the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that an 8-hour delay of TTC staining is reliable for evaluating brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and this probably is attributable to the slow deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme activity in nonischemic brain over this time period </plain></SENT>
