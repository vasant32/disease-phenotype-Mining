<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the involvement of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) and its metabolites in the extracellular fluid of the striatum on the resisting action of electroacupuncture (EA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (CI/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 50 SD male rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, sham-operation (sham), sham + EA, CI/R model, CI/R + EA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI/R model was induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min and reperfusion for 225 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2 Hz, 3 mA, continuous waves) was applied to "Fengchi" (GB 20) for 20 min, with a 10 min rest, and given once again fo 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and its metabolites [3,4- dihydroxy-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA)] in the extracellular fluid of the striatum were determined by microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extracellular levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, DOPAC and HVA in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, sham group and sham+ EA group had no significant changes during the whole study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extracellular level of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> peaked 15-45 min after CI and 0-30 min after CI/R (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rising trend was also observed 120 min following CI/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DOPAC level peaked 15 min and 75 min after CI and 75 min after CI/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After EA, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> level was significantly lower in EA group than that in model group 90 min after CI/R (P &lt; 0.05), and no peak was observed again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After EA, DOPAC level maintained its basic level, and no peak was found after CI/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The changing trend of HVA was similar to that of DOPAC, and the extracellular HVA level in EA + model group was significantly lower than that in model group 75 min after CI/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can decrease the accumulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and its metabolites in the extracellular fluid of the striatum, which may contribute to its effect in preventing the brain from CI/R injury </plain></SENT>
