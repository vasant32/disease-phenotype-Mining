<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that LAU-0901, a novel PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, is neuroprotective in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with behavior and immunohistopathology to expand our understanding of this novel therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats received 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and were treated with LAU-0901 (60 mg/kg) or vehicle 2 h from MCAo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral function, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and apparent diffusion coefficients were performed on days 1, 3, and 7 after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and number of GFAP, ED-1, and NeuN-positive cells were conducted on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral deficit was significantly improved by LAU-0901 treatment compared to vehicle on days 1, 3, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volumes computed from T2WI were significantly reduced by LAU-0901 on days 1, 3, and 7 (by 83%, 90%, and 96%, respectively), which was consistent with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathology revealed that LAU-0901 treatment resulted in significant reduction of cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, attenuated microglial infiltration, and promoted astrocytic and neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest LAU-0901 is a promising neuroprotectant and provide the basis for future therapeutics in patients suffering <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
