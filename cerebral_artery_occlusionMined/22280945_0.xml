<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its cognate receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), are involved in the migration of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test the hypothesis that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with genetically modified CXCR4 can promote their own recruitment around the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lentiviral vectors were used to overexpress the CXCR4-eGFP fusion protein (CXCR4/eGFP) or eGFP only (eGFP) or to introduce siRNA targeting endogenous CXCR4 (siRNA/eGFP) in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were injected with either the transduced rMSCs or PBS as a control via the femoral vein following a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One week after MCAO, immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant increase in the number of eGFP-positive cells surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in the CXCR4-rMSC-treated group compared to the rMSC-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there was a significant reduction in the number of eGFP-positive cells in the siRNA-rMSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was an increase in the capillary vascular volume of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, a reduction in the volume of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and improved neurological function in the CXCR4-rMSC-treated group compared to those in the rMSC-, siRNA-rMSC- or PBS-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CXCR4 overexpression in the rMSCs promoted their mobilization and enhanced neuroprotection in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This strategy may be a useful therapeutic approach for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
