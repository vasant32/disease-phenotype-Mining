<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in the temporal evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathologies between animal models and man have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In view of the importance of this issue for the development of neuroprotective treatments, the temporal evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathologies in the rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model has been evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging modalities under experimental conditions matching as close as possible those used in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex and striatum of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and spin-spin relaxation time (T(2)), as well as total cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, calculated from CBF, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and T(2) maps, were determined starting 1 h up to 216 h post-pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The temporal evolution of the MRI parameters in this rat model was similar to that observed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were decreased for more than 3 days and returned back to baseline between 4 to 8 days, to increase by day 9 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology in this rat model develops at a similar pace as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients arguing against a fundamental difference in the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes however develop differently in this rat model as they invariably increase over the first 48 h, while in humans the evolution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is slower and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
