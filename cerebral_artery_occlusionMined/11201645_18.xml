<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However most of these drugs have limited value as neuroprotectives in clinical therapy because of their side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Memantine is a noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and it has been used for the treatment of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> with relatively few side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the beneficial effects of Memantine and compared its effect with MK-801 in a temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model three hours middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with intraluminal thread and three hours reperfusion was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>78 male Spraque-Dawley rats were divided into three groups as follows: Control (Saline), treatment 1 (MK-801), and treatment 2 (Memantine) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the treated groups, 15 minutes after MCAO, MK-801 and Memantine were administered in amounts of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a 3 hour period of reperfusion, the animals were examined for neurological deficits and then killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following values were measured; cerebral water content, blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability at the core and periphery of the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The severity of neurological deficit (p &lt; 0.001) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p &lt; 0.001) was reduced in both Memantine and MK-801 treated groups compared with saline treated groups </plain></SENT>
