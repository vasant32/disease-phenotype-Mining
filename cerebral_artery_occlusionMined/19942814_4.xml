<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were performed a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and brains were collected at 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein analysis was performed on the cerebral cortex using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein spots with a greater than 3 fold change in intensity between the sham and MCAO groups were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these proteins, 60 kDa heat shock protein, dehydropyrimidinase-related protein 2, t-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33837">complex protein</z:chebi> 1, and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor levels were significantly increased in MCAO group compared to those of the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>, peroxiredoxin-2, stathmin, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide-binding protein alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal-5'-phosphate</z:chebi> phosphatase, and apoplipoprotein A-I levels were significantly decreased in MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces neuronal cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by changing expression levels of several proteins </plain></SENT>
