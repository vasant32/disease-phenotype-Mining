<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of post ictal administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38670">pyrrolopyrimidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation inhibitor, U-101033E, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neuronal and astrocytic metabolism in rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 120 min of MCAO followed by 140 min of reperfusion and randomly assigned to control (n=17) or U-101033E treatment (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug infusion started 5 min after MCAO and lasted 220 min with a 15 min interruption during the reperfusion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen rats underwent diffusion weighted imaging 260 min after ictus, from which the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen rats received an iv bolus injection of [1-13C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [1,2-13C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> 245 min after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue extracts from two brain regions representing penumbra and ischemic core were analyzed with <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> NMRS and HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>U-101033E did not affect the volume of ischemic tissue estimated from the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra, U-101033E specifically decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> metabolism via both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, U-101033E impaired both neuronal and astrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time anaerobic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> usage was increased, leading to increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> labeling and content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also alanine labeling was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data do not support <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> as an important substrate for neuronal mitochondria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> metabolism and increased cytosolic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> metabolism was found in the irreversibly damaged ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present study highlights the importance of other outcome measures than ischemic tissue volume for evaluation of drug efficacy in animal models, which in turn could increase the likelihood of success in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
