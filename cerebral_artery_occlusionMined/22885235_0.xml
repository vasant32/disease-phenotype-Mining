<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesized that MCI-186, a free radical scavenger, would have protective effects on transplantation of BMSCs in a rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, flow cytometry showed the apoptotic rates of BMSCs after simulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) injury was significantly decreased when treated with MCI-186 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two separate MCAO groups were administered with either MCI-186 or phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCI-186 significantly up-regulated the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in ischemic brain, while malondialdehyde decreased and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, another four MCAO groups were administered with either PBS, MCI-186, BMSCs (2Ã—10(6)) or a combination of MCI-186 and BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared with BMSCs or MCI-186 monotherapy, combination therapy significantly improved functional restoration, decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and increased the number of engrafted-BMSCs and neurons in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of engrafted-BMSCs and neurons was significantly correlated with functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that MCI-186 may improve the environment of the injured brain, enhance the survival of engrafted-BMSCs and neurotization in ischemic brain and produce protective effects on BMSCs transplantation </plain></SENT>
