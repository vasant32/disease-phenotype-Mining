<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the management of preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is still controversial in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the influence of preserving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by transient (1h) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, during which mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at normotension (110-120mm Hg, group 1, n=6) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (160-170mm Hg, group 2, n=6) using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI were performed serially at five different time points: before and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and at 1, 4 and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were estimated from apparent diffusion coefficient maps and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured within and outside the perfusion deficient lesion and in the corresponding regions of the contralesional hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and neurological deficits were significantly reduced in group 2 vs. group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher values and rapid restoration of rCBF were observed in group 2, while rCBF in both hemispheres was significantly decreased in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maintaining preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alleviates ischemic brain injury in SHR by increasing collateral circulation to the ischemic region and allowing rapid restoration of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that maintaining preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a valuable approach to managing hypertensive patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
