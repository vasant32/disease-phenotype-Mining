<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since several different pathways are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury, combination therapy rather than monotherapy may be required for efficient neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the protective effects of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitor Gly(14)-humanin (HNG) and a necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) on <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured mouse primary cortical neurons were incubated with Nec-1, HNG or both in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> chamber for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was determined by MTS assay at 24h after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 75 min followed by 24h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were administered HNG and/or Nec-1 (i.c.v.) at 4h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were evaluated and the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nec-1 or HNG alone had protective effects on OGD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment with Nec-1 and HNG resulted in more neuroprotection than Nec-1 or HNG alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with HNG or Nec-1 reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 59.3 ± 2.6% to 47.0 ± 2.3% and 47.1 ± 1.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment with HNG and Nec-1 improved neurological scores and decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 38.6 ± 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrated that the combination treatment of HNG and Nec-1 conferred synergistic neuroprotection on <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by combining anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and anti-necroptosis therapy </plain></SENT>
