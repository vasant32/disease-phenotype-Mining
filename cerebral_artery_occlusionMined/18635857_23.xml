<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic injury can induce neurogenesis in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those newborn neurons can express glutamic acid decarboxylase and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase, markers of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether these GABAergic and cholinergic new neurons could differentiate into functional cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrovirus containing the EGFP gene was used to label dividing cells in striatal slices prepared from adult rat brains after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGFP-targeted immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopy were performed to detect whether newborn neurons could anatomically form neuronal polarity and synapses with pre-existent neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp recording on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> striatal slices of brains at 6 to 8 weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used to determine whether the newborn neurons could display functional electrophysiological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGFP-expressing (EGFP(+)) signals could be detected mainly in the cell body in the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the fourth to thirteenth weeks after their birth, EGFP(+) neurons gradually formed neuronal polarity and showed a time-dependent increase in dendrite length and branch formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGFP(+) cells were copositive for NeuN and glutamic acid decarboxylase (EGFP(+)-NeuN(+)-GAD(67)(+)), MAP-2, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (EGFP(+)-MAP-2(+)-ChAT(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also expressed phosphorylated synapsin I (EGFP(+)-p-SYN(+)) and showed typical synaptic structures comprising dendrites and spines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both GABAergic and cholinergic newborn neurons could fire action potentials and received excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs because they displayed spontaneous postsynaptic currents in picrotoxin- and CNQX-inhibited manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced newly formed striatal GABAergic and cholinergic neurons could become functionally integrated into neural networks in the brain of adult rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
