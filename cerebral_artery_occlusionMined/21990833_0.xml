<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization varies among organ systems in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the extent of pial collaterals is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pial collateral supply was compared among diabetic and non-diabetic patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Databases from two institutions were accessed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and underwent emergent cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were reviewed and graded using a previously published pial collateral grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The collateral grading system was dichotomized into good (pial grades 1-2) and poor (pial grades 3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A χ2 analysis was performed to compare the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and pial collateral grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 104 patients were identified; 56 (54%) patients were men, mean age was 63.5 years and 22 (21%) patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 15.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic population, 15 (68.2%) patients had good pial collaterals while seven (31.8%) patients had poor pial collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the non-diabetic population, 59 (71.9%) patients had good pial collaterals while 23 (28.0%) patients had poor pial collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and pial collateral grade (p=0.7290, Pearson χ2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This series suggests there is no association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the extent of pial collaterals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to understand pial collateral patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and their impact on clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
