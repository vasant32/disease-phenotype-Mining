<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Initially decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values are reversible if reperfusion is rapidly performed after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if reperfusion-induced renormalization of initially abnormal values indicates reversal of cellular, morphologic changes that occur during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen rats underwent 30 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) without reperfusion (group A, n = 6), with 1.5 hours of reperfusion (group B, n = 6), or with 12 hours of reperfusion (group C, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion- and perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained at the end of MCAO and 1.5 and 12 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the final <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study, the brains were fixed by cardiac perfusion with 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal injury was evaluated on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained slices, and astrocytic size was determined by the area of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) plus S-100 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A in which <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values decreased significantly, 47 +/-12% of the neurons were slightly shrunken; astrocytes were moderately swollen, and the area expressing GFAP plus S-100 was larger than that in the contralateral hemisphere (117 microm(2) +/- 6 vs 89 microm(2) +/- 2; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group B in which <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> had renormalized, most neurons were moderately shrunken, and the frequency of such neurons was greater in group B (92% +/- 2) than in group A (P &lt;.001); astrocytes were markedly swollen, and the area was larger than that in the contralateral hemisphere (123 microm(2) +/- 8 vs 85 microm(2) +/- 4, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group C in which a secondary <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease occurred, most neurons (94% +/- 3) were severely shrunken, and some had eosinophilic cytoplasm; astrocytes were disintegrated, and the area of GFAP plus S-100 expression was reduced (78 microm(2) +/- 4 vs 90 microm(2) +/- 5, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> renormalization of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values is not associated with the reversal of neuronal shrinkage and astrocytic swelling that occur during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the morphologic changes of astrocytes and neurons progressively worsen over time, although <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values show a biphasic change </plain></SENT>
