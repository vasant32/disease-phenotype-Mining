<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying parecoxib neuroprotection remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about the role of parecoxib in mediating pathophysiological reactions to ER stress induced by ischemic reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether delayed administration of parecoxib attenuates brain damage via suppressing ER stress-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered parecoxib (10 or 30 mg kg(-1), IP) or isotonic saline twice a day starting 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and forkhead box protein O 1 (Foxo1) in cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction were determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of caspase-12 expression were checked by immunohistochemistry analysis, served as a marker for ER stress-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parecoxib significantly suppressed cerebral ischemic injury-induced nuclear translocation of CHOP and Foxo1 and attenuated the immunoreactivity of caspase-12 in ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the protective effect of delayed administration of parecoxib was accompanied by an increased GRP78 and ORP150 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our study suggested that elevation of GRP78 and ORP150, and suppression of CHOP and Foxo1 nuclear translocation may contribute to parecoxib-mediated neuroprotection during ER stress responses </plain></SENT>
