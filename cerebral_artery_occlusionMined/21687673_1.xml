<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">Gangliosides</z:chebi> consist of mono- or poly-sialylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> chains of variable lengths attached to a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> unit and are found to be intimately involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine the spatial profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> species using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging (IMS) following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) reperfusion injury in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IMS is a powerful method to not only discriminate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> by their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> components, but also by their carbon length within their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to a 30 min unilateral MCAO followed by long-term survival (up to 28 days of reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain sections were sprayed with the matrix 5-Chloro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34292">mercaptobenzothiazole</z:chebi>, scanned and analyzed for a series of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> molecules using an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Traditional histological and immunofluorescence techniques were performed to assess brain tissue damage and verification of the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results revealed a unique anatomical profile of GM1, GD1 and GT1b (d18:1, d20:1 as well as other members of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> family) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was marked variability in the ratio of expression between ipsilateral and contralateral cortices for the various detected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> species following MCAO-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, MCAO resulted in the transient induction of both GM2 and GM3 signals within the ipsilateral hemisphere; at the border of the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data suggest that brain region specific expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi>, particularly with respect to <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> length, may play a role in neuronal responses to injury </plain></SENT>
