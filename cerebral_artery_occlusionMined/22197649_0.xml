<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the effects of Ginkgolide B (GB) and bilobalide (BB) on normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats subjected to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered p.o. with different Ginkgo components GB (6 mg/kg) or BB (6 mg/kg) once daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was made by jugular vein infusion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion was induced by a suture insertion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that both GB and BB exerted neuroprotection under normoglycemia, as determined by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Yet, BB showed less protective effects during hyperglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated during occlusion and the first hour of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BB but not GB caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in CBF after reperfusion, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels were reduced by GB in both models but BB were not effective in reactive oxygen species or malondialdehyde control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that CBF plays crucial roles during early stage of reperfusion in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of compound that improves CBF may have little effect in hyperglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
