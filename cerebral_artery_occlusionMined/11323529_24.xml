<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats underwent 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without recirculation (n = 3) or with 1 hour (n = 4) or 10 hours of reperfusion (n=5) inside the magnet, using a remotely controlled thread occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images and normalized to the preischemic value to obtain relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric lesion volume (HLV) was determined on the last relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps at different relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> thresholds and was compared to the HLV measured by ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and by tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HLVs, defined by ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, were 26.0% +/- 10.6% and 38.1% +/- 6.5% at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 3.3% +/- 2.4% and 4.8% +/- 3.5% after 1 hour of reperfusion, and 11.2% +/- 4.7% and 10.9% +/- 5.2% after 10 hours of recirculation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> thresholds for energy failure were consistently approximately 77% of the control value in the three different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The threshold for tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> was higher at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (86% of control) but was similar to the results obtained for ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> after 1 hour (78% of control) and 10 hours (76% of control) of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the described relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> threshold of approximately 77% of control provides a good estimate for the breakdown of energy metabolism not only during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but also at the early phase of reperfusion, when recovery of energy metabolism is expected to occur, or some hours later, when development of secondary energy failure was described </plain></SENT>
