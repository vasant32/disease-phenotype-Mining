<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (OAT) with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is the standard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are on OAT at the time of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> exacerbates the risk of thrombolysis-associated hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 62 C57BL/6 mice were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To achieve effective anticoagulation, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was administered orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 3 h and assessed functional deficit and HT blood volume after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In non-anticoagulated mice, treatment with rt-PA (10 mg/kg i.v.) after 3 h MCAO led to a 5-fold higher degree of HT compared to vehicle-treated controls (4.0±0.5 µl vs. 0.8±0.1, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> revealed larger amounts of HT after rt-PA treatment in comparison to non-anticoagulated mice (9.2±3.2 µl vs. 2.8±1.0, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rapid reversal of anticoagulation by means of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC, 100 IU/kg) at the end of the 3 h MCAO period, but prior to rt-PA administration, neutralized the exacerbated risk of HT as compared to sham-treated controls (3.8±0.7 µl vs. 15.0±3.8, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In view of the vastly increased risk of HT, it seems to be justified to withhold tPA therapy in effectively anticoagulated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rapid reversal of anticoagulation with PCC prior to tPA application reduces the risk attributed to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> pretreatment and may constitute an interesting therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
