<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Images were made before and after the injection of a superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> compound, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subtraction images demonstrated the region of perfusion deficit as early as 1 hour after occlusion, earlier than conventional T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area of altered perfusion detected by this technique (subtraction imaging after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>-25 administration) correlated with that demonstrated by iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since this magnetic resonance technique can be used to serially estimate the location and size of the ischemic area, the technique can be an important adjunct to metabolic studies of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique may have clinical applications as well </plain></SENT>
