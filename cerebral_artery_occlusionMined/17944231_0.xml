<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 (the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of GHBR) and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-382 (the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of GHBR) were adopted as the tool medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ripe male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 240 - 280 g were randomly divided into seven groups: sham operation group (sham), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion group (Isc/R), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 160 microg x kg(-1) group (N1), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 320 microg x kg(-1) group (N2), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 640 microg x kg(-1) group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29448">(N3)</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-382 640 microg x kg(-1) + <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 640 microg x kg(-1) group (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-382 + N3), and nimodipine (Nim) 600 microg x kg(-1) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model referring to Longa's method with modifications was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of GHBR on behavioral consequence of MCAO rats was studied after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, part of animals were used to measure the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume by TTC staining; ischemic cortex of another part of animals were used to measure the content of intracellular free calcium by flow cytometry, the tNOS, iNOS activity and the content of NO by spectrophotometric method, the content of cGMP by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological function score and infarction volume rate in Isc/R group rats increased significantly than that in sham group; The content of intracellular calcium ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]) of cortex neuron and cGMP, the activities of tNOS and iNOS, and the content of NO in Isc/R group were higher than that in sham group obviously (P &lt; 0.01); These consequence we mentioned of N1, N2, N3 and Nim group were lower than that of Isc/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-382 + N3 group could significantly antagonize the above effect of N3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-356 has protective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury by activating GHBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of GHBR is related with decreasing the content of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, NO, cGMP and tNOS, iNOS activity in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
