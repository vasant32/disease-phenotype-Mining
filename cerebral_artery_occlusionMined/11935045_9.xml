<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed to blood deoxygenation in association with an increased brain oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to detect this signal by susceptibility-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (DSC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging was performed within 4 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 6 patients with unilateral cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (middle cerebral artery, n=5; internal carotid artery, n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood volume was estimated on a pixel-by-pixel basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DSC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images taken before arrival of the contrast medium were examined visually to identify hypointense areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral regions of interest were set in the middle cerebral artery territory for comparison of the mean signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A semilogarithmic plot of signal intensity versus cerebral blood volume for every pixel in the region of interest was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The side on which the hypointense area was seen was significantly correlated with the side of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean signal intensity was significantly smaller on the affected side than on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The semilogarithmic plot of signal intensity versus cerebral blood volume indicated greater <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations for the ipsilateral than for the contralateral region of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DSC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images allow detection of hypointensity in the affected cerebral hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such hypointensity may indicate increased oxygen extraction fraction (misery perfusion) and may provide information valuable to patient care </plain></SENT>
