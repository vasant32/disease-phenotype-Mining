<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA-15) is known to modulate various cellular processes including cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> can regulate the levels of PEA-15 and its two phosphorylated forms (Ser 104 and Ser 116) in a cerebral ischemic injury model and in neuronal cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed to induce focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were immediately treated with vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) at the beginning of the MCAO, and then cerebral cortices were collected 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease in PEA-15 level after ischemic injury was detected using a proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> administration prevented the ischemic injury-induced decrease of PEA-15 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Western blot analysis clearly confirmed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> attenuates the ischemic injury-induced decreases in PEA-15, phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104), and phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 116) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> exposure induced significant reductions in the levels of PEA-15 and the two phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104 and Ser 116) in cultured hippocampal neuron, while pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity-induced decreases in these proteins levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease of phospho-PEA-15 protein level indicates that the anti-apoptotic function of PEA-15 was being inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> protects neuronal cells against ischemic injury by maintenance of phospho-PEA-15 protein levels </plain></SENT>
