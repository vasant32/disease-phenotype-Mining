<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were measured in 15 SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DIND complications occurred in seven patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were low in SAH patients during the 10 days following the SAH event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were lower in patients with DIND complications than in those who did not develop DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant transient decline in CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels was also observed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of DIND in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced hypocretin/orexin production observed in SAH patients may reflect reduced brain function due to the decrease in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results, taken together with recent experimental findings in rats that indicate hypocretin receptor 1 (orexin 1 receptor) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein are elevated following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, suggest that a reduction in hypocretin/orexin production in SAH and DIND patients is associated with alterations in brain hypocretin/orexin signaling in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
