<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that is most frequently used is a rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported a link between levels of cell-free DNA (CFD) and neurologic outcome in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess brain injury and measure CFD levels in 2 models of MCAO in rats, and to determine whether brain injury correlates with CFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 60 rats were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty rats underwent a sham procedure, 20 rats had MCAO using a monofilament, and 20 rats had MCAO with a silicon-coated filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups were further divided into 2 subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1 subgroup of 10 rats, neurologic performance [measured as a neurologic severity score, (NSS)] was measured at 1 and 24 hours after the procedure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second subgroup of 10 rats, CFD was measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours and at 2, 3, 4, and 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic performance (measured as a NSS) was measured at 1 and 24 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main finding was a significant increase in CFD levels observed 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and CFD levels of the 3 groups was R=0.78, P&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and NSS also were strongly correlated with CFD levels at 24 hours after MCAO (R=0.91, P&lt;0.0001 and R=0.73, P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that CFD levels correlate well with the extent of ischemic injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and neurologic outcome in rats 24 hours post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that CFD correlates well with the expected temporal progression of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings place CFD in a unique place as a biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both experimentally and possibly clinically </plain></SENT>
