<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess whether these surrounding regions consist of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, we explored the distribution of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> within and around the hyperintense area on T2-weighted MRI using proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in 25 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> imaged between 1 and 42 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho) ratios were significantly reduced in both areas of T2 hyperintensity and in surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction was greater in the region of T2 hyperintensity than in the surrounding region (-50% vs. -28%, respectively) and was unrelated to the delay after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi>/Cho ratios increased massively within the abnormal T2 area, but did not differ from control values beyond the margin of hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall data indicate that T2 visible lesions on MRI do not infer the entire injured tissue </plain></SENT>
