<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The importance of postmenopausal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in females remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that female rats sustain less infarction in reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) than their ovariectomized counterparts and that vascular mechanisms are partly responsible for improved tissue outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> strongly protects the male brain, even when administered in a single injection before MCAO injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the hypothesis that replacement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> to physiological levels improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in ovariectomized, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-deficient female rats, acting through blood flow-mediated mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age-matched, adult female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and treated with 0, 25, or 100 microgram of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> administered through a subcutaneous implant or with a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8389">Premarin</z:chebi> (USP) injection (1 mg/kg) given immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced (n=10 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each animal subsequently underwent 2 hours of MCAO by the intraluminal filament technique, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral parietal cortex perfusion was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical and caudate-putamen infarction volumes were determined by 2,3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow was measured in ovariectomized females with 0- or 25-microgram implants (n=4 per group) by (14)C-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels were 3.0+/-0.6, 20+/-8, and 46+/-10 pg/mL in the 0-, 25-, and 100-microgram groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caudate-putamen infarction (% of ipsilateral caudate-putamen) was reduced by long-term, 25-microgram <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment (13+/-4% versus 31+/-6% in the 0-microgram group, P&lt;0.05, and 22+/-3% in the 100-microgram group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, cortical infarction (% of ipsilateral cortex) was reduced only in the 25-microgram group (3+/-2% versus 12+/-3% in the 0-microgram group, P&lt;0.05, and 6+/-3% in the 100-microgram group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic striatal or cortical blood flow was not altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment at the neuroprotective dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was unchanged by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment before MCAO when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated animals were compared with saline vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement within a low physiological range ameliorates ischemic brain injury in previously ovariectomized female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective mechanism is flow-independent, not through preservation of residual ischemic regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the therapeutic range is narrow, because the benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> is diminished at larger doses, which yield high, but still physiologically relevant, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lastly, unlike in the male brain, single-injection <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> exposure does not salvage ischemic tissue in the female brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although exogenous steroid therapy protects both male and female <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-deficient brain, the mechanism may not be identical and depends on long-term hormone augmentation in the female </plain></SENT>
