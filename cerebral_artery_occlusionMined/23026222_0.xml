<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glatiramer <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">Acetate</z:chebi> (GA) is an immunomodulatory drug that has been approved for the treatment of human multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> by means of a number of mechanisms: reduced microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, Th0 differentiation shifting from Th2 to Th2 and Treg with anti-inflammatory cytokine production and increased neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We induced permanent (pMCAo) or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) and GA (2mg) or vehicle was injected subcutaneously immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were sacrificed at D3 to measure neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, microglial cell density and qPCR of TNFα and IL-1β (pro-inflammatory microglial cytokines), IFN�� (Th2 cytokine), IL-4 (Th2 cytokine), TGFβ and IL-10 (Treg cytokines), and at D7 to evaluate neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurogenesis assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that in GA-treated pMCAo mice, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, microglial cell density and cytokine secretion were not significantly modified at D3, while neurogenesis was enhanced at D7 without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction </plain></SENT>
