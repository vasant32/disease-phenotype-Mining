<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is rapidly upregulated in the brain after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-α acts by binding to its receptors, TNF-R1 (p55) and TNF-R2 (p75), on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was first to investigate if there is altered expression of TNF-α and TNF-α receptors in cerebral artery walls following global or focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and after organ culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we asked if the expression was regulated via activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The hypothesis was tested in vivo after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and in vitro by organ culture of isolated cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The localization and amount of TNF-α, TNF-α receptor 1 and 2 proteins were analysed by immunohistochemistry and western blot after 24 and 48 h of organ culture and at 48 h following SAH or MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, cerebral arteries were incubated for 24 or 48 h in the absence or presence of a B-Raf inhibitor (SB386023-b), a MEK- inhibitor (U0126) or an NF-κB inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi>-0354), and protein expression evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced expression of TNF-α, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 in the walls of cerebral arteries at 48 h after MCAO and SAH compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-localization studies showed that TNF-α, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 were primarily localized to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm of the smooth muscle cells (SMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was, in addition, some expression of TNF-R2 in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed that these proteins were upregulated after 24 and 48 h in culture, and this upregulation reached an apparent maximum at 48 h of organ culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with U0126 significantly reduced the enhanced SMC expression of TNF-α, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 immunoreactivities after 24 and 48 h of organ culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Raf and NF-κB inhibitors significantly reduced organ culture induced TNF-α expression while they had minor effects on the TNF-α receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and organ culture induce expression of TNF-α and its receptors in the walls of cerebral arteries and that upregulation is transcriptionally regulated via the MEK/ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
