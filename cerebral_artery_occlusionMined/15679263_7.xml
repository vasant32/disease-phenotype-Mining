<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since sedation of animals is necessary to avoid artifacts, a mixture of ketamine and xylazine is frequently used for anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the suitable dosage of narcotics and its correlation to severe respiratory adverse events in 269 cases of ketamine/xylazine anesthesia in male Wistar rats for performance of magnetic resonance imaging after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia depth was not measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was efficacious in avoiding movement artifacts during imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Necessary dosage was lower if rodents were subjected to MCAO instead of sham surgery, if body weight was below baseline, and if time since surgery was short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If anesthesia was induced during the first 2 days after surgery in animals with body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, necessary dose rates were 27% below doses required for rats more than 10 days post-surgery with body weight above baseline (91.4/8.3 versus 125.1/11.3 mg of ketamine/xylazine/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dose adaptation scale for the prediction of necessary dose rates was developed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If unsuccessful, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are needed until spontaneous breathing is restored or xylazine effects are antagonized </plain></SENT>
