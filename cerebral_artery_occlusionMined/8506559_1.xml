<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TA3090 (Clentiazem) has been shown to have cerebrovascular protective properties in three experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An in vivo investigation was undertaken to determine its effects on pial arteries and cerebral blood flow and its therapeutic value in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This experiment was divided into two protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first, 200 or 400 micrograms/kg per hour TA3090 was administered continuously for 3 hours in cats without ischemic insult (n = 6 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects on pial arteries and cerebral blood flow were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second protocol, 400 micrograms/kg per hour TA3090 (treated group, n = 14) or physiological saline (control group, n = 10) was administered 5 minutes before 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects on the pial arteries and cerebral blood flow were observed continuously, followed by autoradiography for a quantitative measurement of cerebral blood flow 5 hours after middle cerebral artery recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volumes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were estimated by planimetry from cerebral preparations made for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pial arteries dilated by up to approximately 10% in the 400-micrograms group and 3% in the 200-micrograms group 30 minutes after administration of TA3090 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increases in cerebral blood flow of about 10% in the 400-micrograms group and 2% in the 200-micrograms group were demonstrated with laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second protocol, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of pial arteries was significantly smaller during and after the ischemic insult in the treated group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow decreased less significantly during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01 at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and increased less significantly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01 at the end) in the treated group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autoradiography showed a more remarkable increase in cerebral blood flow due to luxury perfusion in the cerebral cortex, which was mainly perfused by the middle cerebral artery on the affected side in the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus on the contralateral side of the treated group increased by about 20% more than that of the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Cerebral edema</z:hpo> and infarction were much smaller in the treated group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) TA3090 dilates pial arteries and increases cerebral blood flow in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain regions in a dose-response fashion; 2) in ischemic regions compared with those in untreated animals, TA3090 results in a lesser reduction of cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in a lesser degree of hyperemia during reperfusion; 3) TA3090 is associated with less pial artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, presumably due to improved collateral flow; and 4) the improved hemodynamic state with TA3090 is associated with significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
