<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hemodynamics of infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the brain in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to a complete middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, to compare factor analysis, a novel method of analyzing perfusion-weighted images, with more conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with complete unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery were examined by T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and time-to-peak-intensity (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) images were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis of dynamic studies (FADS) was used to generate "early" and "late" images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameters for the infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the occluded territory were compared with those for the brain territory on the nonoccluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three regions were shown: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> tissue on the unaffected side; (2) an infarcted region, which was characterized by reduced CBV, CBF, and early FADS values with increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> values; and (3) a noninfarcted region with reduced early FADS and increased late FADS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> values compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood volume and CBF values were not reduced significantly in the noninfarcted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The differences in parameters such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, CBV, and CBF are significant, and it is necessary to use more than one parameter when interpreting magnetic resonance imaging perfusion data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis of dynamic studies provides additional information to conventional methods of analyzing perfusion data </plain></SENT>
