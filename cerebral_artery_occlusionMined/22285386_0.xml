<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 50 patients (39 males and 11 females; mean age 70 ± 11 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who were able to undergo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head within 24 hours of starting rt-PA infusion therapy while hospitalized at our center between April 2007 and October 2010, 23 patients (18 males and 5 females; mean age 71 ± 9.4 years) with hyperacute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with findings of obstruction in the proximal segment of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M1) served as subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 23 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 13 (57%) were recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of factors related to recanalization revealed a significant difference (P = .019) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index &gt;25 kg/m(2)), with significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients in the nonrecanalized group than in the recanalized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study revealed no significant differences in other factors between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be involved in recanalization after hyperacute rt-PA infusion therapy in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
