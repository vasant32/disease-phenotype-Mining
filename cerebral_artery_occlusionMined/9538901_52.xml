<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, threads of different diameter (80 to 260 microns) were inserted into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of animals of different weights (18 to 33 g), and the success of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> was evaluated by imaging the ischemic territory on serial brain sections with carbon black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> resulted in a linear relationship between body weight and thread diameter (r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.01), allowing precise selection of the appropriate thread size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler measurements of CBF, neurological scoring, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining confirmed that matching of animal weight and suture diameter produced consistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, imaging of ATP, tissue pH, and cerebral protein synthesis allowed differentiation between the central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, in which ATP was depleted, and a peripheral penumbra with reduced protein synthesis and tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> but preserved ATP content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion deficits and ischemic tissue alterations could also be detected by perfusion- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, demonstrating the feasibility of dynamic evaluations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of multiparametric imaging techniques in this improved <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model opens the way for advanced pathophysiological studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in gene-manipulated animals </plain></SENT>
