<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the effects of NXQ against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats and against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced cell injury of hippocampal neurons as well as against <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> injury of cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral administrations of NXQ at 20, 40, 80 mg/kg/day for 7 days (3 days before MCAO and 4 days after MCAO) significantly reduced the lesion of the insulted brain hemisphere and improved the neurological behavior of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures, treatment with NXQ at 5 - 20 microg mL concentration protects the neurons against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
