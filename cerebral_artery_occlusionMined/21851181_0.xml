<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that compromised cardiovascular function during static exercise may involve altered expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) protein within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared cardiovascular responses and iNOS protein expression within the left and right sides of both RVLM and CVLM in sham-operated rats and in rats with a 90 min left-sided <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24Â h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increases in blood pressure during a static muscle contraction were attenuated in MCAO rats compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, iNOS expression within the left RVLM was augmented compared with the right RVLM in MCAO rats and compared with both RVLM quadrants in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, compared with sham-operated rats and the right CVLM of MCAO rats, iNOS expression was attenuated in the left CVLM in left-sided MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the attenuation of pressor responses during static exercise in MCAO rats involves overexpression of iNOS within the ipsilateral RVLM and attenuation in iNOS within the ipsilateral CVLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differential expression of iNOS within the medulla plays a role in mediating cardiovascular responses during static exercise following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
