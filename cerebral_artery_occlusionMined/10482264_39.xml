<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T2-weighted imaging were acquired before and during occlusion, and after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A coregistration method was used to correlate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes of the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCav) with the histology after 72 hours at the same topographic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initially reduced ADCav values recovered completely in both the lateral caudoputamen and upper frontoparietal cortex in the 8-, 15-, and 30-minute groups, partially in the cortex, and not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the caudoputamen in the 60-minute group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histology showed that the caudoputamen was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or had mild neuronal injury in the 8-minute group and invariably had some degree of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the 15-, 30-, and 60-minute groups, whereas the cortex was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or had varying degrees of neuronal injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No histological abnormalities were seen in the sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ADCav reversal does not always predict tissue recovery from ischemic injury and that temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for even 8-minute duration can cause delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that is more severe in the caudoputamen where the initial ADCav decline was greater than in the cortex </plain></SENT>
