<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> has been reported to impair endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function and is detrimental to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the role of ACE2 in regulating EPC function in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EPCs were cultured from human renin and angiotensinogen transgenic (R+A+) mice and their controls (R-A-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In in vitro experiments, EPCs were transduced with lentivirus-ACE2 or lentivirus-green fluorescence protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of ACE2 overexpression on EPC function and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> oxidase (Nox) expression were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACE2, eNOS, and Nox inhibitors were used for pathway validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In in vivo studies, the therapeutic efficacy of EPCs overexpressing ACE2 was determined at day 7 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that (1) lentivirus-ACE2 transduction resulted in a 4-fold increase of ACE2 expression in EPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied with an increase in eNOS expression and NO production, and a decrease in Nox2 and -4 expression and reactive oxygen species production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) ACE2 overexpression improved the abilities of EPC migration and tube formation, which were impaired in R+A+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects were inhibited by ACE2 or eNOS inhibitor and further enhanced by Nox inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) Transfusion of lentivirus-ACE2-primed EPCs reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits, and increased cerebral microvascular density and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that ACE2 improves EPC function, via regulating eNOS and Nox pathways, and enhances the efficacy of EPC-based therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
