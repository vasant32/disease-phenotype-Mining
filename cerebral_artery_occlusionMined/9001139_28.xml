<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion was evaluated 3 h after occlusion and subdivided into the lesion core and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone based on the magnitude of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, measured by using histochemical staining 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, correlated best with MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as assessed by an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> threshold of 25% decrease from baseline at 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> thresholds of greater than 25% decrease, lesion size was not significantly different in nNOS- and WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, brain tissue showing <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases of 10-25% was significantly smaller in the ipsilateral hemisphere of mutants (27 +/- 2% and 21 +/- 2% in WT and nNOS-, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings occurred independently of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and are consistent with a smaller peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone in nNOS- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the smaller peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone is a reflection of less severe metabolic disturbance after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in nNOS- mice, possibly related to diminished production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) or a related product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that magnetic resonance techniques previously used to assess ischemic damage in larger animals can be extended to the mouse, raising the possibility that the molecular mechanisms leading to ischemic damage can be examined by using genetically engineered mice </plain></SENT>
