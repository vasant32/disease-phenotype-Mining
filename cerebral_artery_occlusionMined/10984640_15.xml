<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) was induced in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats for 1 h followed by varying periods of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> identified by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining revealed extensive lesion in normothermic (NT) 37 degrees C and small lesion in hypothermic (HT) 33 degrees C group of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Bcl-2 was induced in many neurons of HT group, while Bax and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> was induced in few neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ detection of DNA fragmentation using 3'-OH end labeling method (terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labelling (TUNEL)) indicated, higher number of TUNEL-positive cells in NT group, but significantly decreased in HT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern revealed many neurons at the penumbra region could survive in HT group whereas, many neurons are committed to die in NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is selectively interfering at more than one place and providing protection </plain></SENT>
