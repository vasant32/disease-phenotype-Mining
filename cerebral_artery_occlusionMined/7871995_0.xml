<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the effect of AMG-1 on free calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) in rat intrasynaptosome and on the isolated rat tail artery contraction induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) were studied by using Fura-2 fluorescence technique and contraction force measurement, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we suggest that the mechanism of AMG-1 in improving cerebral ischemic damage may be due to the decrease of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
