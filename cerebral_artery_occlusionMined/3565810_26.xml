<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this has not been evaluated in the more common case of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, e.g., as caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore compared the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/fentanyl anesthesia on neurologic and neuropathologic outcome in baboons subjected to 6 h of transorbital left MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to MCAO, animals were assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 (n = 7) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (in O2/air) in concentrations sufficient to maintain deep burst suppression on the EEG (2.0% +/- 0.5% inspired, mean +/- SD); group 2 (n = 6) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> (O2/air) in doses adequate to maintain similar EEG suppression (3.6 +/- 0.7 g total); and group 3 (n = 6) received 60% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/40% O2 and fentanyl (25 micrograms/kg load, 3 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1 infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efforts were made to keep mean arterial pressure (MABP) between approximately 80 and 100 mmHg, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi>/hydralazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6794">metaraminol</z:chebi>, with PaCO2 at approximately 30 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The selected <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> was established 45 min before MCAO, was maintained until 1 h after clip removal, and in decreasing concentrations for 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was scored for 7 days and formalin-fixed brains were later sectioned for determination of infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of seven group 1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>) animals were hemiplegic, and 7/7 had verified infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 4 of 6 group 2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>) animals were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with 2/6 having infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome in group 3 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/fentanyl) was intermediate between groups 1 and 2 (3/6 hemiplegic, 4/6 with infarctions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in the infarction rates between groups 1 and 2 was significant (P less than 0.05), while a similar comparison of neurologic outcome scores achieved a P value of 0.055 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Infarctions in group 1 were more hemorrhagic in character than in group 3 (groups 1 and 2 could not be meaningfully compared) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results must be considered in light of differences in MABP during the occlusion period; MABP in group 1 was approximately 80 mm Hg in spite of vasopressor use, while that in group 2 was approximately 100 mmHg (in spite of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, they fail to demonstrate any protective value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia, at least when compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
