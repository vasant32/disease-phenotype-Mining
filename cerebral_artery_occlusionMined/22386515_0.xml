<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Amniotic membrane is known to have the ability to transdifferentiate into multiple organs and is expected to stimulate a reduced immunologic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMCs) do not express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule and may be expected to show immunologic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A good deal of research has explored the clinical therapeutic potential of hAMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we isolated hAMCs and transfected them with the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene using lentiviral vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were then transplanted into the brains of rats subjected to a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hAMCs survived for three weeks in the brains of the ischemic rats, and some of the transplanted hAMCs expressed the neuronal marker MAP2 and the neuronal progenitor marker Nestin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, caspase-3 activity and iNOS expression were decreased in the vicinity of the graft and injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, intracerebral grafting of EGFP-modified hAMCs and BDNF-transduced hAMCs significantly ameliorated behavioral dysfunction in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BDNF-hAMCs ameliorated the behavioral dysfunction of rats more rapidly and effectively relative to EGFP-hAMC-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the grafts also reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>hAMCs survived in the brain tissue and improved functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of ethical concerns and the high supply of these cells, hAMCs represent a promising clinical treatment for gene delivery similar to stem cell strategies </plain></SENT>
