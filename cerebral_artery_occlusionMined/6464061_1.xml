<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow and pial artery pressure were determined prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and after 15, 60 and 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiments (after 120 min <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) heads were frozen in situ with liquid nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cooled brains were cut into 0.5 cm thick slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these slices twenty-micron sections passing through the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were prepared in a cryostat and used in the pictorial presentation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-fluorescence was recorded from the tissue slice, immersed in liquid nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, tissue samples were taken from regions of interest and used for quantitative determination of biochemical substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two animals permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion led to disturbances in the energy-producing metabolism, as indicated by reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and ATP, and increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regions exhibiting bright <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-fluorescence were much smaller than those in which ATP was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 6 animals <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-fluorescence was not increased but even decreased in areas with disturbed energy-producing metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was obtained after comparing cortical blood flow measured 15 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with the area of ATP-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> at the end of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the size of ATP-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> did not correlate with flow measured 60 or 120 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
