<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes express the gap junctional protein connexin-43, which permits exchange of small molecules in brain and enhances synaptic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stromal cells produce soluble factors including bone morphogenetic protein 2 and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bone morphogenetic protein 2/4) in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested whether intra-carotid infusion of bone marrow stromal cells promotes synaptophysin expression and neurological functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with or without bone marrow stromal cells at 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> via intra-arterial injection (n=8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A battery of functional tests was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine, Ki67, bone morphogenetic protein 2/4, connexin-43, synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuronal nuclear antigen, and double staining of 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine/glial fibrillary acidic protein, 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine/neuronal nuclear antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein/bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein/connexin-43 were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with bone marrow stromal cells significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved functional recovery compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">Bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine and Ki67 positive cells in the ipsilateral subventricular zone were significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased in bone marrow stromal cell treatment group compared with the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of bone marrow stromal cells significantly (P&lt;0.05) promoted the proliferating cell astrocytic differentiation, and increased bone morphogenetic protein 2/4, connexin-43 and synaptophysin expression in the ischemic boundary zone compared with the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 expression correlated with the expression of connexin-43 (r=0.84, P&lt;0.05) and connexin-43 expression correlated with the expression of synaptophysin (r=0.73, P&lt;0.05) in the ischemic boundary zone, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Administration of bone marrow stromal cells via an intra-carotid route increases endogenous brain bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 and connexin-43 expression in astrocytes and promotes synaptophysin expression, which may benefit functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
