<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Protein S is an antithrombotic factor that also exhibits mitogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that protein S may control cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and protect brain tissue from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied protein S in a murine in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and an in vitro model of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals received purified human plasma-derived protein S or vehicle intravenously 10 minutes after initiation of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein S at 0.2 to 2 mg/kg significantly improved the motor neurological deficit by 3.8- to 3.2-fold and reduced infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volumes by 45% to 54% and 45% to 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein S at 2 mg/kg improved postischemic cerebral blood flow by 21% to 26% and reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and infiltration with neutrophils by 40% and 53%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>Intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> was not observed with protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein S protected ischemic neurons in vivo and cultured neurons from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human protein S exerted protective effects from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced damage similar to the plasma-derived protein S both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protein S is a significant neuroprotectant during ischemic brain injury with direct effects on neurons and antithrombotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, protein S could be a prototype of a new class of agents for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with combined direct neuronal protective effects and systemic antithrombotic and antiinflammatory activities </plain></SENT>
