<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The adult mammalian brain contains resident neural progenitors in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of neural progenitors increases after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in both of these regions, but the mechanisms that promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neural progenitor proliferation are not yet understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that diffusible factors from the ischemic area play a role in this process as the DG is remote from the area of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed that the peak of neural progenitor proliferation in the ipsilateral DG was between day 2 and day 4 of reperfusion after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GeneChip and real-time PCR analysis showed a three- to 102-fold increase in the expression of 15 diffusible, mitogenic factors in the ischemic cortex at 3 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) showed increased protein expression in the activated astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the progenitors in both the SVZ and DG showed IGF-1 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting IGF-1 activity by introcerebroventricular infusion of IGF-1 antibody significantly prevented the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neural progenitor proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that IGF-1 formed in the ischemic penumbra might be one of the diffusible factors that mediate post-ischemic neural progenitor proliferation </plain></SENT>
