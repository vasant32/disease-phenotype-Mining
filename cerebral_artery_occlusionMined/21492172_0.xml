<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34247">BHT</z:chebi>, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15 min before and 15 min after, or orally once 30 min or 120 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO (50 or 200 mg/kg each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of mBHT 30 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> also markedly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, mBHT did not inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-Methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
