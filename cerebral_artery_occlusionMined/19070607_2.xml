<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to establish whether the neuroprotection induced by LAU-0901 persists with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and subjected to 2 h of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) induced by means of a poly-L-lisine-coated intraluminal nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with either LAU-0901 (60 mg/kg) or vehicle (45% cyclodextran) administered i.p. at 2 h from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They received neurobehavioral examinations during MCAo (60 min) and then at 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days followed by histopathology at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LAU-0901 significantly improved the behavior compared to the vehicle group, beginning on day 1 (by 29%, p=0.00007) and persisting throughout a 30-day survival period (42%, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle treatment, LAU-0901 treatment significantly increased volume of non-infarcted brain tissue loss relative to the unlesioned hemisphere (16.3 +/- 4.6% vs. 46.0 +/- 10.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results establish that LAU-0901 confers enduring ischemic neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
