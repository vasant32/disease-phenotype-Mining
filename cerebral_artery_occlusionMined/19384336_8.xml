<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is critical in oligodendrogenesis; Gli1 is the principal effector of Shh signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated oligodendrogenesis and Shh/Gli1 pathway activation after bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMSCs have been shown to promote functional recovery post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A therapeutic dose of BMSC (3 x 10(6) cells) treatment was initiated 1 day after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was carried out to measure the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, myelin, and expressions of Shh and Gli1 at 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of Shh and Gli1 was tested at 2 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An in vitro study was used to investigate the effects of BMSC on a premature oligodendrocyte cell line (N20.1 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMSC treatment significantly increased O4(+) oligodendrocytes, MBP(+) area, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+), NG2(+), BrdU(+)-NG2(+) cells, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of Shh and Gli1 in the ipsilateral brain of the MCAo rats than that in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMSCs promoted N20.1 cell proliferation and Gli1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and these effects were abolished by the Shh pathway inhibitor cyclopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the BMSC treatment stimulates oligodendrogenesis by activation of the Shh/Gli1 pathway post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
