<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, there is limited data on intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for isolated posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate recanalization, outcome and quality of life in patients who undergo thrombolysis for isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of 9 patients treated with IAT and 9 patients treated with IVT with short-term (3 months) outcome and long-term (median 23 months) outcome after IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 9 of 546 patients treated with IAT (4 women and 5 men; median age 66 years) had isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median baseline National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> and variable additional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered bithalamic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to treatment was 5.8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was complete in 2, partial in 2, minimal in 2, and not achieved in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recanalization tended to be better when the microcatheter was placed in or close to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed no major complications, and 3 months outcome was favorable (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) in 67% of the patients after IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 9 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion were treated with IVT with 89% favorable clinical outcomes at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow-up after IAT, neuropsychological domains were more severely impaired than other neurologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IAT is a feasible treatment of isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was favorable in the majority of patients after IAT and IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No major complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to compare IAT and IVT for isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
