<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients receive thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, new therapeutic strategies focusing on neuroprotection are under review, among which, inhibition of the proteasome is attractive, as it affects multiple cellular pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> have severe side effects, we applied the novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> BSc2118, which is putatively better tolerated, and analysed its therapeutic potential in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using the intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BSc2118 was intrastriatally injected 12 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in mice that had received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline or recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator injections during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain injury, behavioural tests, western blotting, MMP9 zymography and analysis of angioneurogenesis were performed for up to 3 months post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single injections of BSc2118 induced long-term neuroprotection, reduced functional impairment, stabilized blood-brain barrier through decreased MMP9 activity and enhanced angioneurogenesis when given no later than 12 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator enhanced brain injury, which was reversed by BSc2118 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein expression of the transcription factor HIF1A was significantly increased in saline-treated and recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-treated mice after BSc2118 application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, knock-down of HIF1A using small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> constructs or application of the HIF1A inhibitor YC1 (now known as <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 1 (RBMS1)) reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, loss of neuroprotection after combined treatment with BSc2118 and YC1 in recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-treated animals was in the same order as in saline-treated mice, i.e. reduction of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator toxicity through BSc2118 did not solely depend on HIF1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> BSc2118 is a promising new candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, which may in addition alleviate recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-induced brain toxicity </plain></SENT>
