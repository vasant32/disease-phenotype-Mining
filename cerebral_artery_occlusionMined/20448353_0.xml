<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 96 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into 4 groups (n=24): a control group, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) model group, a low dose TSG [60 mg/(kg.d)]group, and a high dose TSG [120 mg/(kg.d)]group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6 days intragastric (ig) administration of TSG or natural saline (I/R group), reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established by intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats of control group were operated on while the middle cerebral artery was not blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 d after the reperfusion, behavior test was used to evaluate the neurological deficiency of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein expressions of nerve growth factor (NGF), growth associated protein (GAP)-43, and protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) in the cortex were measured by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the I/R group, the neurological defect scores of the 2 TSG groups were significantly lower except at 6 h after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the I/R group, the protein expression of NGF, GAP-43, and PKAc after the reperfusion of the 2 TSG groups increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The protein expression of NGF may increase when treated with TSG after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion, which activates the PKA pathway and increases the protein expression of GAP-43 that protects the neuron </plain></SENT>
