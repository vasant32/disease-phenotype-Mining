<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein is required for the maintenance of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the embryonic and adult hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> causes increased proliferation of hippocampal NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether Shh regulates the increase in proliferation of NPCs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male SV129 mice were exposed to a 20-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; hippocampi were then analyzed for Shh <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary cell cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and NPCs were exposed to 16 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) and analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot for Shh expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of NPCs, in vivo and in vitro, was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the cell types examined in vitro, only NPC and neurons increased Shh <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> increased proliferation of NPCs and this proliferation was enhanced by the addition of recombinant Shh or blocked by the pathway-specific inhibitor, cyclopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was associated with a transient 2-fold increase in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding both Shh and its transcription factor, Gli1, 0.5 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the hippocampus, Shh protein was increased approximately 3-fold 3 and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and was observed predominantly within cells in the CA3 and hilar regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Shh was expressed only in mature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vivo, cyclopamine suppressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced proliferation of subgranular NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Shh pathway plays a role in the proliferation of NPCs induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and might participate in injury remodeling </plain></SENT>
