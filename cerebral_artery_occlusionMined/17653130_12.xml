<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the chemical composition of these deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpressing (hAPP695) rats and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates were subjected to transient MCAO for 2 h or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 26-week survival time, histological examination revealed an overlapping distribution pattern for rodent and human Abeta in the thalamus of hAPP695 rats subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X-ray microanalysis showed that the deposits did not contain significant amount of iron, zinc, or copper typical to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the deposit both in hAPP695 and non-transgenic rats contained calcium and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> in a ratio (1.28+/-0.15) characteristic to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatites</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16866">Alizarin red</z:chebi> staining confirmed that calcium coaccumulated in these Abeta deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that APP expression is induced by ischemic insult in cortical neurons adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, which in turn is reflected as increased release of Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> by their corticothalamic axon endings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This together with insufficient clearance or atypical degradation of Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> lead to dysregulation of calcium homeostatis and coaccumulation in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
