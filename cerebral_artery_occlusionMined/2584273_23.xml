<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased 2DG uptake preceded decreased 2DG uptake and infarction in the caudate putamen and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased 2DG uptake without infarction was observed for 72 h in thalamus and for 24 h in hippocampus (areas remote from the ischemic zones) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study supports the concept of cell excitation as a pathophysiologic process in permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time course of increased metabolism may demarcate the time window of opportunity for the previously demonstrated attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> size with inhibition of cell excitation by pharmacologic blockade of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission </plain></SENT>
