<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, untreated group, sham-operated group, non-acupoint group and Shuigou group, with 10 rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a modification of the technique of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury was induced in rats except <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham-operated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats in the sham-operated group underwent identical experimental procedures as the other groups, except that the nylon suture was inserted into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the behavioral deficit was evaluated by using Zausinger 6-point neurological function score, rats in the Shuigou group and non-acupoint group were separately acupunctured and stimulated by continuous-wave with 2 Hz frequency, 1 mA intensity, for 10 minutes, twice a day for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-acupoint was located at the left side 0.5 cm of the Shuigou point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No intervention was given to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Zausinger 6-point neurological function and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> were measured after 72-hour treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The latency at the affected side in the untreated group was significantly longer than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (P&lt;0.05), and the amplitude at the affected side was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 3-day electro-acupuncture, the latency at the affected side of rats in the Shuigou group was obviously shortened as compared with the untreated group (P&lt;0.05), and the amplitude was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latency at the affected side in the Shuigou group was shorter than that in the non-acupoint group (P&lt;0.05), and the amplitude tended to increase as compared with the non-acupoint group, but there were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences on the latency and amplitude between the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The neurobehavioral score of the Shuigou group was significantly higher than those of the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P&lt;0.05), and there were no significant differences between the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture at Shuigou can increase the latency and amplitude of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> in rats after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
