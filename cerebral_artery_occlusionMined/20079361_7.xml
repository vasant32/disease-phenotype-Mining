<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most newborn cells will die within 1-2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently have revealed that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (P4) promotes the survival of newborn neurons in the DG and improves the neurological dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to further explore the effects of P4 on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis in the DG, SVZ and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to label proliferating cells on day 3 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P4 (4 mg/kg) was injected for 3 consecutive days at BrdU-D(-1 to 1) (from one day before to one day after BrdU-injection) or BrdU-D(4-6) (4-6 days after BrdU-injection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The P4-treatment at BrdU-D(-1 to 1) attenuated the increase in the density of 24-h-old BrdU(+) cells in MCAO-DG and -SVZ, which was blocked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50781">5alpha-reductase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5062">finasteride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P4-treatment at BrdU-D(4-6) significantly increased the density of 28-day-old BrdU(+) cells in MCAO-DG without changing the population ratios of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) and BrdU(+)/GFAP(+) cells, which was sensitive to the blockade of P4 receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the P4-treatment at BrdU-D(4-6) produced approximately 2-fold increase in the density of 28-day-old BrdU(+) cells in MCAO-striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that the P4-treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> suppresses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-stimulated proliferation of progenitor cells but improves the poor survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced newborn cells </plain></SENT>
