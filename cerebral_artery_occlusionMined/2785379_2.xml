<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion by noninvasive means, we studied visual-evoked potentials in the patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion (occlusive group), as well as in those without <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion (nonocclusive group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of other examinations that also detected an occipital lobe pathologic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of those examinations were highly specific to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials yielded high incidence of abnormality in the occlusive group (86% and 75%, respectively), and expressed the side of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion if the occlusion was unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials is popular and a low-cost examination compared with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, we conclude that pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials is the most practical mean to explore <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
