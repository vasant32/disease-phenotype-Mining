<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental groups consist of rats subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and at 24 h after MCAo intravenous injection of (n=10/group): Group 1: phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1 ml) for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 2: NONOate alone (0.4 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 3: hMSCs (1 x 10(6)) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 4: hMSCs (1 x 10(6)) with NONOate (0.4 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional tests and immunohistochemical staining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marginal functional recovery after treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was found with 1 x 10(6) hMSCs alone (p=0.06) and no benefit was detected with NONOate alone (0.4 mg/kg, p=0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, NONOate+hMSCs in combination significantly induced functional recovery (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment using hMSC in combination with NONOate significantly increased vessel perimeter and endothelial cell proliferation compared with hMSC or NONOate alone treatment (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment promoted increased, BrdU positive cell number in the subventricular zone (SVZ), migrating neuronal doublecortin immunoreactive cells and VEGF and bFGF expression in the ischemic boundary area compared to individual treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The functional therapeutic enhancement of combination treatment may be attributed to increased plasticity induced by the combination of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> and hMSC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that pharmacological and cellular therapy may provide an additive therapeutic benefit after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
