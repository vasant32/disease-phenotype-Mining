<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its bioavailability is low after oral administration due to poor absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration has been considered as an effective method for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system drug delivery for its brain-targeting effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, whether intranasal GRb1 could ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the concentration of GRb1 in brain tissues and plasma after intranasal and intravenous delivery was calculated using HPLC-MS/MS methods in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250Â±10 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intranasal GRb1 was considered brain-targeting if the value of the drug targeting index (DTI) was greater than 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 1.5 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were killed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects were measured using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting of LC3 and Beclin 1, crucial autophagy-related proteins, was used to monitor the state of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a local bioavailability of 10.28-32.48% and DTI of 7.35-23.22 in different brain regions, intranasal GRb1 was determined to be brain-targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and more intact neuronal structure were observed in the GRb1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GRb1 also restored the elevation of LC3 and Beclin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our work suggests that intranasal GRb1 exerts brain-targeting effects and that a single dose of intranasal GRb1 immediately after MCAO ameliorates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Autophagy is involved in these beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
