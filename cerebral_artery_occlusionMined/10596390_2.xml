<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of the improvement of CBF has not been clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study in the rat pial microvasculature after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) is to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> on leukocyte-endothelium interaction, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of brain injury by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion and concerns induction of secondary brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">Rhodamine 6G</z:chebi>-labeled leukocytes at the brain surface were visualized with intra-vital fluorescence videomicroscopy through a closed cranial window and an analysis was made of the number of adherent leukocytes and the centerline leukocyte velocity in the venule before MCAO, after reperfusion of MCAO and after infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (Group 1) or saline (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of adherent leukocytes decreased and the centerline leukocyte velocity increased statistically significantly immediately after the infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> in Group 1, but there was no significant change in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> washes away the adherent leukocytes and prevents them from interfering with the blood cell and plasma flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, secondary brain damage may be relieved by decreasing the adherence of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, modulating the adherence of leukocytes is one of the important factors in the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
