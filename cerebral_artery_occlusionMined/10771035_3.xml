<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that alpha-eudesmol from Juniperus virginiana Linn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(Cupressaceae) inhibits potently the presynaptic omega-agatoxin <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>-sensitive Ca(2+) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of alpha-eudesmol on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size determined after 24 h of reperfusion following 1 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first found that alpha-eudesmol concentration-dependently inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release from rat brain synaptosomes and that its inhibitory effect was Ca(2+)-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> study, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) treatment with alpha-eudesmol significantly attenuated the post-ischemic increase in brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>alpha-Eudesmol also significantly reduced the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining after 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a microdialysis technique, we further demonstrated that alpha-eudesmol inhibits the elevation of the extracellular concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these results, we suggest that alpha-eudesmol displays an ability to inhibit exocytotic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and to attenuate post-ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
