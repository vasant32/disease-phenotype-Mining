<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated-p38 was observed after 2 h and 5 h of reperfusion after 1 h of MCAO in C57/B6 mice and AT1a knock out mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a delay of phosphorylation of p38 in the reperfusion model of the AT1a knock-out mouse, and detected microglia in the striatum on the ischemic side that were phosphorylated-p38-positive after 71 h of reperfusion in both animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between AT1a and delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or between AT1a and activation of caspase-9 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
