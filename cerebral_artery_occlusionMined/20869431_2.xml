<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cocaine-and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-regulated transcript (CART) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> have been reported to have neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects in various cell and animal experimental models, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, CART's role in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the relevant immune-regulating mechanisms was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In male C57BL/6 mice subjected to 120 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), with or without CART treatment or sham operation, peripheral immune parameters and serum catecholamins (CAs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CART reduced blood CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in MCAO mice at 24 h, while upregulated spleen CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines expressions in MCAO mice at 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in comparison to control mice, CART-treated mice demonstrated elevated serum CAs at 6 and 24 h, whereas reduced serum levels of CAs and blood regulatory T (Treg) cells at 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytokine expression, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits in mouse brain were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CART reduced post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological functions, with reduced expression of inflammatory factors in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate that CART plays an important role in modulating post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> immune response and exerts a neuroprotective effect in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings also suggest that the possible mechanism of CART's protective action in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the regulation of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (SNS) pathway since CAs, Treg cells and interleukin (IL)-10 are the major modulators of SNS </plain></SENT>
