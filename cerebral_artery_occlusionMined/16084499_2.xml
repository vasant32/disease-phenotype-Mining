<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the attenuation is a result of altered expression of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) within the rostral (RVLM) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have compared cardiovascular responses and nNOS protein expression within the four quadrants, i.e., left and right sides of both RVLM and CVLM in sham-operated rats (n = 10) and in rats with a temporary 90-min left-sided MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in mean arterial pressure during a static muscle contraction were significantly attenuated in MCAO rats when compared to sham rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> reduced nNOS expression within the ipsilateral RVLM quadrant compared to the contralateral RVLM or RVLM quadrants of control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, compared to sham rats and the right CVLM quadrant of MCAO rats, nNOS expression was significantly augmented in the ipsilateral CVLM in left-sided MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the attenuation of cardiovascular responses during static muscle contraction in MCAO rats is partly due to a reduction in nNOS expression within the ipsilateral RVLM and an overexpression of nNOS abundance within the ipsilateral CVLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrate that nNOS expression within the medulla plays a significant role in mediating cardiovascular responses during static exercise in intact and pathophysiological conditions </plain></SENT>
