<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, (Z)-1-[N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) amino] diazen-1-ium-1, 2-diolate (DETA-NONOate) and bone marrow stromal cells promotes functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying functional improvement have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that combination treatment upregulates angiopoietin-1 and its receptor Tie2 in the ischemic brain and bone marrow stromal cells, thereby enhancing cerebral neovascularization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> male C57BL/6 mice were i.v. administered PBS, bone marrow stromal cells 5x10(5), DETA-NONOate 0.4 mg/kg or combination DETA-NONOate with bone marrow stromal cells (n=12/group) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment significantly upregulated angiopoietin-1/Tie2 and tight junction protein (occludin) expression, and increased the number, diameter and perimeter of blood vessels in the ischemic brain compared with vehicle control (mean+ or -S.E., P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, DETA-NONOate significantly increased angiopoietin-1/Tie2 protein (n=6/group) and Tie2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (n=3/group) expression in bone marrow stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DETA-NONOate also significantly increased angiopoietin-1 protein (n=6/group) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (n=3/group) expression in mouse brain endothelial cells (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin-1 mRNA (n=3/group) was significantly increased in mouse brain endothelial cells treated with DETA-NONOate in combination with bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium compared with cells treated with bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium or DETA-NONOate alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mouse brain endothelial cell capillary tube-like formation assays (n=6/group) showed that angiopoietin-1 peptide, the supernatant of bone marrow stromal cells and DETA-NONOate significantly increased capillary tube formation compared with vehicle control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment significantly increased capillary tube formation compared with DETA-NONOate treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of angiopoietin-1 significantly attenuated combination treatment-induced tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that combination treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with DETA-NONOate and bone marrow stromal cells promotes neovascularization, which is at least partially mediated by upregulation of the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 axis </plain></SENT>
