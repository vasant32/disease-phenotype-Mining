<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> microglial activation (MA) may have both neurotoxic and pro-repair effects, particularly in the salvaged penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mapping MA in vivo is therefore an important goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195, a ligand for the 18 kDa translocator protein, is the reference radioligand for MA imaging, but a correlation between the regional distributions of in vivo tracer binding and post mortem MA after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as assessed with PET and immunohistochemistry, respectively, has not been demonstrated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we performed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 microPET in a rat model previously shown to induce extensive cortical MA, and determined the correlation between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 and immunostaining with the CD11 antibody OX42, so as to verify the presence of activated microglia, in a template of PET-resolution size regions-of-interest (ROIs) spanning the whole affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent 45 min distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 PET at Days 2 and 14 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> according to a longitudinal design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following perfusion-fixation at Day 14, brains were removed and coronally cut for OX42 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 binding potential (BPND) parametric maps were generated, and in each rat both BP(ND) and OX42 (intensity√óextent score) were obtained in the same set of 44 ROIs extracted from a cytoarchitectonic atlas to cover the whole hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations were computed across the 44 ROIs both within and across subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant BPND increases were observed in both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and surrounding areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats at day 14; less strong but still significant increases were present at day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were highly significant (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.001) positive correlations, both within- and across-subjects, between day 14 BPND values and OX42 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between Day 14 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 and OX42 across the affected hemisphere from the same brain regions and animals further supports the validity of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 as an in vivo imaging marker of MA following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The finding of statistically significant increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-PK11195 as early as 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results have implications for mapping MA after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with potential therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
