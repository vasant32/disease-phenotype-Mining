<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to visualize and monitor periinfarct flow transients (PIFTs) in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) with two different laser methods in a closed-skull model of filament middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A laser Doppler probe was placed over the ischemic cortex 5 mm lateral to Bregma, and a 5 x 5 mm area centered 5 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to Bregma was thinned for laser speckle imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both neurological and histological evaluations were performed at 72 hr postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean flow during 90-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was 29% of baseline measured by laser Doppler and 36-54% by laser speckle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow transients occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, the number of PIFTs being 4.6 +/- 1.8/90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By both methods, 95.6% of them occurred with temporal correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average duration of PIFTs was also identical (162 +/- 24 and 162 +/- 34 sec, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five different <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> of flow transients ranging from hypoperfusive to hyperemic were identified by laser speckle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PIFTs changed their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> dynamically over certain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the animals showed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (178.5 +/- 26 mm(3)) in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler in itself can be a reliable method for counting/detecting PIFTs, but laser speckle is capable of monitoring the dynamic changes in PIFT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> over the penumbral and periischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
