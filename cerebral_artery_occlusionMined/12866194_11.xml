<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that a brief period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> increases tolerance to a subsequent severe ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) was applied as pre-conditioning to testify whether this kind of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> could preserve the function of mitochondria with the impairment induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activities of respiratory enzyme complex I to IV, mitochondria swelling, membrane potential, and membrane fluidity were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area decreased greatly due to the ischemic pre-conditioning (IP) revealing the preventive effect of IP on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activities of respiratory enzyme complex III, IV were effectively preserved (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05) compared with MCAO group through ischemic pre-conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling and membrane fluidity were protected by IP, and also an increased trend was found in membrane potential, which indicated that the integrity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It suggested that the function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was effectively protected by this kind of pre-conditioning </plain></SENT>
