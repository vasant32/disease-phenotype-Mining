<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assess the relationship of the time frame of intravenous tPA administration with the outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 135 consecutive patients with AIS and transcranial duplex documented middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion treated with intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was defined as total improvement on thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) grades 2 h after tPA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was evaluated by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels in 33 patients with available plasma samples before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results are follows: 92 (68.1%) patients were treated in the diurnal (9:00-21:00) and 43 (31.8%) in the nocturnal period (21:00-9:00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was recorded in 52/135 (38.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the rate of complete recanalization (45.6% vs. 23.2%; p = .01) and good clinical outcome (64.1% vs. 44.2%; p = .02) were significantly higher in the group of diurnal tPA administration compared with those treated in the nocturnal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of diurnal tPA treatment for complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization was 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-5.52; p = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diurnal tPA infusion significantly improved the overall distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale, as compared with nocturnal treatment (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.16-4.64 by ordinal regression analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low PAI-1 levels were associated with complete recanalization but did not significantly differ between the two time frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, diurnal administration of tPA is associated with complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization and better functional outcome at 90 days in patients with AIS </plain></SENT>
