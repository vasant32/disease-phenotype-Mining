<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND and PURPOSE: The intraluminal thread model for middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) has gained increasing acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous modifications have been reported in the literature, indicating that the technique has not been standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to evaluate and optimize the reliability of this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO by 2 different intraluminal filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was continuously monitored over both hemispheres by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In part I (3-0 filament), we evaluated the incidence of adequate MCAO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and the effects of heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In part II (<z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated 4-0 filament), we also determined the influence of insufficient MCAO on morphological and functional outcome and the incidence of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In part I, SAH occurred in 30% and premature reperfusion in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals with a decrease in contralateral flow had suffered SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation was not observed in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In part II, SAH occurred in 8% and premature reperfusion in 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in outcome between rats with primary MCAO and rats with filament correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Animals with uncorrected premature reperfusion had significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and fewer neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SAH and insufficient MCAO may be more common in the intraluminal thread model than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Inadvertent premature reperfusion contributes to the interanimal variability associated with this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of valid experiments increases with the use of a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated 4-0 filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Continuous bilateral LDF is indispensable to monitor adequate MCAO and is highly sensitive to recognize SAH </plain></SENT>
