<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> response was examined in rats undergoing 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 4.5 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it is not clear whether the vasoreactivity improves during reperfusion in parallel with tissue recovery, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> response was determined spatially resolved, sequentially in the initially ischemic but later recovered areas and in the permanently damaged areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity maps were determined from the difference in perfusion signal intensity before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity (administration of 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> for 5 minutes) was expressed in % change of perfusion signal intensity/mm Hg of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>(2) increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATP levels of tissue were used as a measure of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recovered and permanently damaged tissues were differentiated by combined use of end-ischemic <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map and ATP image at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The preischemic (control) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity of 3.5+/-0.9%/mm Hg decreased dramatically during MCAO in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, it remained &lt;1%/mm Hg in the region with end-ischemic <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> &lt;80% of the preischemic control value, but showed gradual recovery in the region with end-ischemic <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> &gt;80% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although at the end of the experiment the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity was significantly higher in the recovered tissue than in the permanently damaged tissue (1.15+/-0.44 and 0.13+/-0.47%/mm Hg, respectively; P:&lt;0.01), it still remained far below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control value (P:&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in combination with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge permits the investigation of the spatially resolved vascular reactivity during a longitudinal study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is followed by a prolonged disturbance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity, despite already normalized energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
