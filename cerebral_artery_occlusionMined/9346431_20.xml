<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we explored if the secondary bioenergetic failure, which occurs a few hours after recirculation, following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats, is caused by a compromised reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We induced 2 hours of MCAO and measured CBF at the end of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as well as 15 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the start of recirculation, using autoradiographic or tissue sampling <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of MCAO, the autoradiographically measured CBF in the ischemic core areas was reduced to 3 to 5% of contralateral values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reduction in CBF was less in neighboring, penumbral areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After recirculation, flow already normalized in core tissues after 15 minutes, and remained close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for the 4 hours recirculation period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in penumbral tissues, recovery CBF values were usually below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that tissues that are heavily compromised by the 2-hour period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and are destined to incur infarction, show a "relative hyperemia" during recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, some areas of the previously densely ischemic tissue showed overt hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding raises the question whether the relative or absolute hyperemia reflects events that are pathogenetically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because drugs that clearly ameliorate the final damage incurred fail to alter the relative hyperperfusion of previously ischemic tissues, it is concluded that vascular events in the reperfusion period do not play a major role in causing the final damage </plain></SENT>
