<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNFbp is a dimeric form of the type I soluble TNF receptor linked to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (TNFbp), and binds and inhibits TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNFbp produced a significant reduction in the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (22.6 +/- 3.5 mm3 immediately after MCAO; 25.2 +/- 2.4 mm3 1 h after MCAO) compared with vehicle-treated animals (30.3 +/- 3.7 mm3 immediately post MCAO; 31 +/- 3.7 mm3 1 h after MCAO (mean +/- S.D.) when administered intracranially up to 60 min post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of TNFbp was sustained in mice for 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation at the margin of the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was dramatically reduced in mice treated with TNFbp whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control animals showed consistent and obvious DNA fragmentation 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNFbp could have therapeutic value for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> if the problem of delivery to brain can be overcome </plain></SENT>
