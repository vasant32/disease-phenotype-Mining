<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether Nogo-A is involved in the secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> in the thalamus after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of Nogo-A in ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus in RHRSP was observed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, intracerebroventricular infusion of NEP1-40, a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, was administered starting 24 h after MCAO and continued for 1, 2 and 4 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage and regeneration were evaluated by analysis of the immunoreactivity (IR) of amyloid betaA4 precursor protein (APP), growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in ipsilateral VPN of the thalamus at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the expression of Nogo-A in oligodendrocytes increased persistently and its localization became redistributed around damaged axons and dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of NEP1-40 downregulated the expression of Nogo-A, reduced axonal injury and enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that Nogo-A is involved in secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> and that inhibition of Nogo-A can reduce neuronal damage in the thalamus after distal MCAO </plain></SENT>
