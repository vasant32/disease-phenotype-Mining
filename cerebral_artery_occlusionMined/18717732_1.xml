<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rats, the extent of neural damage may be limited to basal ganglia structures or may also include portions of the frontal and parietal cortex in severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the primary motor cortex (M1) is anatomically spared in proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, its functional integrity is suspect because even a small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can damage neural circuits linking M1 with basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This motivated the present study to investigate the neurophysiological integrity of M1 after transient proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats, preoperatively trained and non-preoperatively trained to reach for food, received extensive reach training/testing with the contralateral-to-lesion paw for several weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The forelimb movement representations were assayed from the ipsilateral-to-lesion M1 with intracortical microstimulation approximately 10 weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Digit flexion was impaired during food grasping in rats with relatively small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and was completely abolished in rats that sustained at least moderate subcortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding forelimb movement representations ranged from abnormally small to absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in subcortical territories of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> does not spare the neurophysiological properties of M1 despite its apparent anatomical intactness, probably because of damage sustained to its descending fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, M1 dysfunction contributes to the impairments that ensue from proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, even when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is limited to subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
