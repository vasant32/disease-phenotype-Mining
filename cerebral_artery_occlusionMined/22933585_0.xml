<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous factors involved in the adaptive response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor are transcriptionally regulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factors (HIFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During normoxia, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi>-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins hydroxylate HIF-α subunits, resulting in their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of neuronal deletion of PHD2, the most abundant isoform in brain, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We generated neuron-specific Phd2 knockout mice and subjected animals to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were determined by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF target genes were analyzed by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuron-specific ablation of Phd2 significantly increased protein stability of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the forebrain and enhanced expression of the neuroprotective HIF target genes erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter and glycolysis-related enzymes under hypoxic and ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice with Phd2-deficient neurons subjected to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> exhibited a strong reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of hippocampal CA1 neurons located in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region was dramatically reduced in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessel density in forebrain subregions, except for caudate-putamen, was not altered in Phd2-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings denote that the endogenous adaptive response on hypoxic-ischemic insults in the brain is at least partly dependent on the activity of HIFs and identify PHD2 as the key regulator for the protective <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that specific inhibition of PHD2 may provide a useful therapeutic strategy to protect brain tissue from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
