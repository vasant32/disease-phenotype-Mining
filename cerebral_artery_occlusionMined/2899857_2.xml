<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A model was set up in order to evaluate the importance of hemispheric perfusion pressure when the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is occluded in anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 6 animals the internal carotid artery (ICA) was occluded prior to ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; in 17 animals the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> only was occluded; 6 animals underwent the same preparation, but the vessels were left unoccluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four days after surgery the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured with a computerized image analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infarcted areas were significantly larger in the ICA + <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded group compared with the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded group (p less than 0.005), which in turn had larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than the sham-operated animals (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that patients with hypoperfusion, due to severe ICA stenosis and impaired collateral blood supply, are at higher risk of developing major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, when embolism into a cerebral artery occurs, as compared to patients with no, or only minor, reduction in hemispheric perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
