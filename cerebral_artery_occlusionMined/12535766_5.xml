<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> resulted in an immediate drop of the LDF signal to 21.4+/-8.0% which was followed by a partial recovery to 31+/-11% in animals without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a sustained decrease to 7.4+/-5% (P&lt;0.05 vs. non-SAH) occurred in animals with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, unintentional rupturing of the intracerebral carotid artery can easily and reliably be detected by single LDF monitoring immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
