<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients suffering distal pial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusion developed a pattern of internal borderzone infarction on follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery or carotid siphon stenosis or occlusion was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusions, prior to the origin of the lenticulostriate arteries, were associated with extensive cortical and deep infarction in the entire <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was proximal carotid artery or siphon stenosis or occlusion in 12 of these 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 patients showed a mixture of proximal and distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions and patchy ischemic damage in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of superficial cortical watershed infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that internal borderzone infarctions may result from intracranial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusions alone and need not be associated with hemodynamic alterations due to large vessel extracranial disease </plain></SENT>
