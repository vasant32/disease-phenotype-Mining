<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> increases this basal progenitor cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the time frame of proliferation, length of survival and the phenotypes of the new cells formed after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to sham controls, ischemic rats showed a significantly higher number of newly proliferated cells (as defined by BrdU immunostaining) in both the DG (by fourfold, p &lt; 0.05) and the SVZ (by twofold, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DG showed increased proliferation only in the first week of reperfusion and 49% of the cells formed in this period survived to the end of third week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas, SVZ showed a continuous proliferation up to 3 weeks after MCAO, but the cells formed survived for less than a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both DG and SVZ, at the end of the first week of reperfusion, majority of the BrdU-positive (BrdU+) cells were immature neurons (DCX positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the DG, 28% of the cells formed in the first week after MCAO mature into neurons (NeuN positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ischemic cortex and striatum showed several BrdU+ cells which were ED-1 positive microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 week of reperfusion, MCAO-induced progenitor cell proliferation in the ipsilateral DG was significantly increased by i.c.v. infusion of IGF-1 (by 127 +/- 14%, p &lt; 0.05) and GDNF (by 91 +/- 5%, p &lt; 0.05), compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the growth factor treated rats subjected to transient MCAO, several BrdU+ cells formed in the first week survived up to the third week </plain></SENT>
