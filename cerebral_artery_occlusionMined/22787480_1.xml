<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parvalbumin is a calcium buffering protein that plays an important role in modulating intracellular calcium concentration and regulating apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether EGb 761 affects parvalbumin expression in cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proteomic approach revealed a reduction in parvalbumin expression in the vehicle-treated animals, whereas EGb 761 pretreatment attenuates the ischemic injury-induced decrease in parvalbumin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses clearly confirmed the fact that EGb 761 prevents the injury-induced decrease in parvalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results of immunohistochemical staining showed that the number of parvalbumin-positive cells was lower in vehicle-treated animals than in sham-operated animals, and EGb 761 averted this decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results suggest that the maintenance of parvalbumin expression is associated with the neuroprotective function of EGb 761 against neuronal damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
