<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is not completely understood yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of ATV treatment on the synaptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins after a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic male Wistar rats were treated with 10 mg/kg ATV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first dose was 6 hr after reperfusion, then every 24 hr for 3days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed that ATV treatment produced an increase in pAkt ser473 and a decrease in pMAPK 44/42 protein levels 12 and 24 hr postischemia in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, p120 catenin and αN-catenin became drastically increased throughout the temporal course of postischemia treatment (12-72 hr), mainly in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological recovery was observed at 48 and 72 hr, supported by a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, and glial hyperreactivity after 72 hr of postischemia treatment with ATV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATV treatment also up-regulated the association of p120(ctn) , αN-catenin to PSD-95, accompanied by a reduction of RhoA activation and the recovery of MAP2 immunoreactivity, these being significantly affected by the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that p120(ctn) and αN-catenin synaptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins are crucial molecular targets in ATV-mediated neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
