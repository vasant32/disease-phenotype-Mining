<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effect of triacetylshikimic acid (TSA) on the platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to neutrophils and P-selectin expression on activated platelet membrane induced by thrombin and reperfusion after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to neutrophils was evaluated by rosette assay, and P-selectin expression on platelet membrane was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TSA 10 - 1000 micromol/L markedly inhibited thrombin(0.4 kU/L)-induced platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to neutrophils induced by a 21-h reperfusion after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 h was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TSA 50 - 200 mg/kg given by ig immediately and at 60 min again after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TSA was also shown to decrease the P-selectin expression on platelet surface induced by thrombin in washed platelet and by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) 5 micromol/L in whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and thrombin induced platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to neutrophils, which could be reduced by TSA probably due to its inhibition of P-selectin expression on activated platelets </plain></SENT>
