<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether EGb 761 modulates Bcl-2 family proteins in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male adult rats were treated with EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), brain tissues were collected 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EGb761 administration significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain injury induced decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 prevented not only the injury-induced decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) levels, but also the injury-induced increase of Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the presence of EGb 761, the interaction of Bad and Bcl-X(L) decreased compared to that of vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, EGb 761 prevented the injury-induced increase of cleaved PARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding suggests that EGb 761 prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> against ischemic brain injury and EGb 761 neuroprotection is affected by preventing the injury-induced increase of Bad and Bcl-X(L) interaction </plain></SENT>
