<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The AdEasy System was used to construct the recombinant adenoviral vector carrying HIF-1alpha gene and green fluorescent protein and PCR was used to identify the HIF-1alpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and reperfusion models were established and divided into Ad-HIF-1alpha group, Ad group and NS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After Ad-HIF-1alpha, Ad and NS were injected into the ischemic ventricle, expression of Ad-HIF-1alpha was observed and its therapeutic effect was evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and neurological severity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GFP expression distributed apart from the ventricle and reached a peak at 14 days and persisted for about 4 weeks under fluorescent microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological severity scores was 2.4 +/- 0.5 at 24 h in Ad-HIF-1alpha group and there was no statistical significance compared with Ad group (2.6 +/- 0.5) and NS group (2.7 +/- 0.7) (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scores were 1.6 +/- 0.7 at 48 h and 0.9 +/- 0.6 at 72 h in Ad-HIF-1alpha group, and there were statistical significance compared with Ad group (2.9 +/- 0.6 and 3.2 +/- 0.6 respectively) and NS group (3.0 +/- 0.7 and 3.2 +/- 0.8) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 81.2 mm(3) +/- 1.4 mm(3) at 72 h in Ad-HIF-1alpha group and there was statistical significance compared with Ad group (173.9 mm(3) +/- 1.3 mm(3)) and NS group (171.7 mm(3) +/- 6.2 mm(3)) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha gene had definite therapeutic effect on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in adult rats, which settles a foundation for next HIF-1alpha gene study and clinic application </plain></SENT>
