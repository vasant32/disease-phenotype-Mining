<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas this <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> increase in CSF is only evidenced during the first 6 h in stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, it is sustained for 24 h in progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to study the evolution of serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model of permanent cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi>, glycine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and tryptophan were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography from serum samples taken before and at different times after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and from sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After MCAO, a 3-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and a 2-fold increase in glycine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were observed in rat serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this amino acid increase began 4-6 h after ischemic induction, reached peak values at 8-24 h and returned to preischemic values by 48-72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and tryptophan were not modified after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats did not exhibit changes of basal amino acid concentrations in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The serum excitatory amino acid profile in this experimental model confirms that the early detection of increased concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine at systemic circulation observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a consequence of the cerebral ischemic process </plain></SENT>
