<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that ischemic insult increases the formation of autophagosomes and activates autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of autophagy in ischemic neuronal damage remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was taken to assess the role of autophagy in ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was introduced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of autophagy was assessed by morphological and biochemical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the contribution of autophagy/lysosome to ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, rats were pretreated with a single intracerebral ventricle injection of the autophagy inhibitors 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (3-MA) and bafliomycin A1 (BFA) or the cathepsin B inhibitor Z-FA-fmk after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of 3-MA and Z-FA-fmk on brain damage, expression of proteins involved in regulation of autophagy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that pMACO increased the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of LC3-II and the protein levels of cathepsin B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3-MA, BFA and Z-FA-fmk significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of 3-MA and Z-FA-fmk were associated with an inhibition on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced upregulation of LC3-II and cathepsin B and a partial reversion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced downregulation of cytoprotective Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that ischemic insult activates autophagy and an autophagic mechanism may contribute to ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, autophagy may be a potential target for developing a novel therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
