<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was occluded by surgical operation, and intestinal transit and geometric center as a parameter of gastrointestinal motility and expression of c-Fos protein in the insular cortex and cingulate cortex were measured at 2 and 12 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intestinal transit was 66.3+/-7.5% and 62.3+/-5.7% 2 and 12 h after sham operation, respectively, and MCAO significantly decreased intestinal transit to 39.0+/-3.5% and 47.0+/-5.1% at 2 and 12 h after the occlusion, respectively (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The geometric center was 5.6+/-0.4 and 5.2+/-0.9 at 2 and 12 h after sham operation, respectively, and MCAO significantly decreased geometric center to 2.9+/-0.8 and 3.0+/-0.3 at 2 and 12 h after the occlusion, respectively (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In control animals, injection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> decreased intestinal transit to 35.9+/-5.2%, and injection of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801, decreased intestinal transit to 28.8+/-9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK-801, a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, in the MCAO group decreased intestinal transit to 11.8+/-3.2%, which was significantly decreased compared to MCAO group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO markedly increased the expression of c-Fos protein in the insular cortex and cingulate cortex ipsilateral to the occlusion 2 h after MCAO, and pretreatment with MK-801 produced marked reduction of c-Fos protein expression compared to MCAO group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that modulation of gastrointestinal motility after MCAO might be partially mediated through a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor system </plain></SENT>
