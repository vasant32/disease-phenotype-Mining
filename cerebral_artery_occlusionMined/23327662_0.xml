<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract This study was to investigate the protective effect of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-7 (rhBMP-7) on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injuries and their underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An intraluminal suture method was used to generate a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in rats, which was followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sham operation (SO) group underwent the procedure without occlusion, while an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion group (IR) and rhBMP-7 treated group (RT) underwent occlusion in the absence and presence of rhBMP-7 (250 μg/kg) administered via a femoral vein injection 30 min prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, neurological function, brain water content, and morphological alterations were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, and immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays were used to detect nuclear NF-κB p65 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the SO group, IR rats showed a decrease in neurological function, an increase in brain water content, and pathological and morphological damage (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were also detected in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, RT rats had reduced injury following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, while immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays consistently detected increased expression of nuclear NF-κB following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion, these levels were reduced in the RT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of rhBMP-7 prior to reperfusion effectively inhibited the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury by attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and ameliorating ultrastructural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms responsible for these observations potentially involve the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion by rhBMP-7 via an NF-κB-related signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
