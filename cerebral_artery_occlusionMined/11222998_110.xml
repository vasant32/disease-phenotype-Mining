<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are associated with the opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, but their cellular localization and activation mechanisms are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used immunohistochemistry to determine the cellular localization of the MMPs in reperfused rat brain, and cell cultures to study their activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) had a 90 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for times from 3 h to 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections were immunostained with antibodies to gelatinase A (MMP-2), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and gelatinase B (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated control rats showed MMP-2 immunostaining in astrocytic processes next to blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion MMP-2 immunostaining increased in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 h immunoreactivity for MMP-3 and MMP-9 appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 co-localized with activated microglia (Ox-42+) and ischemic neurons (NeuN+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 immunostaining was seen at 48 h in endothelial cells, neutrophils, and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 5 and 21 days intense MMP-2 staining was seen in reactive astrocytes around the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies of activation of the MMP were done in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-stimulated astrocyte and microglia cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stimulated astrocytes produced an activated form of MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When microglia were stimulated, they activated MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed MMP-3 in cultures of enriched microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The hydroxymate-type, MMP inhibitor, BB-1101, blocked the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by LPS in mixed glial cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We propose that MMP-2 is normally present in astrocytic end feet, and that during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> MMP-9 and MMP-3 are produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 in microglia/macrophages may be activating proMMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our results show that a differential expression of MMPs by astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells at the blood vessels is involved in the proteolytic disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
