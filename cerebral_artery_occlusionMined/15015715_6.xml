<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to study the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized using chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg i.p.) and subjected to 2 h of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-Tocopherol</z:chebi> was administered at the dose of 125 and 250 mg/kg orally 1 h prior to the occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor performance test (grip test, foot fault test, rotarod performance test, spontaneous locomotor activity), markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were carried out 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A vehicle-treated group was run parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> at the dose of 125 mg/kg neither improved neurologic deficit, nor decreased the raised level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers in comparison with the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, higher dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> (250 mg/kg p.o.) afforded significant protection as evident by increase in motor performance tests and a decrease in the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The raised levels of malondialdehyde after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were also significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that exogenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> is able to reduce the neuronal damage caused during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, which can be attributed to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
