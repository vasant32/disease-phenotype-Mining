<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides insights into the dynamics of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is induced outside the magnet bore, preventing investigators from acquiring pre-ischemic images for later pixel-by-pixel comparisons and from studying the earliest changes in the hyperacute phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we introduce a new and easy to apply in-bore occlusion protocol based on the intraarterial embolization of ceramic macrospheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PE-50 tubing, filled with saline and six macrospheres (0.315-0.355 mm in diameter), was placed into the internal carotid artery (ICA) of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were transferred into an MRI scanner (7.0 T) and baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-imaging was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then the macrospheres were injected into the internal artery to occlude the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic DWI and T2-imaging was started immediately thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) (a marker for cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>) and T2-relaxation time (a marker for vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>) were determined in the ischemic lesions and compared to the unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> significantly declined within the first 5-10 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T2-relaxation time increased as early as at the first T2-imaging time-point (20-35 min after embolization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 150 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the lesions covered 18.0 +/- 7.4% of the hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model failed in one out of nine animals (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This model allows <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-imaging from the initial minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It does not permit reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This technique might provide information about the pathophysiological processes in the hyperacute phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
