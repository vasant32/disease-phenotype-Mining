<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the role of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, in ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a murine focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and bid-deficient mice of inbred C57BL/6 background were subjected to 90-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 72-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volume of ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly smaller in the bid-deficient brains than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> brains, suggesting that Bid participated in the ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, following the ischemic treatment there was a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic areas, particularly in the inner <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone (the penumbra), of the bid-deficient brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, activation of Bid in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> brains could be readily detected at approximately 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as evidenced by its proteolytic cleavage and translocation to the mitochondria as determined using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> could be detected around the same time Bid was cleaved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release was detected in the bid-deficient brains until 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway might be activated by multiple mechanisms during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, Bid is critical to its early activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This notion was further supported by the finding that caspase-3 activation was severely impaired in the bid-deficient brains, whereas activation of caspase-8 was much less affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that Bid is activated early in neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a caspase-8-dependent fashion and that Bid is perhaps one of the earliest and most potent activators of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the role of Bid in the induction of ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may render this molecule an attractive target for future therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
