<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, many neuroprotective strategies have been targeted at molecules that are able to act as an oxidant to intervene with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> which contain <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties have undoubtedly efficacious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, therapeutic effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) against cerebral protection in Wistar rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison study was conducted by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression levels of pro-apoptotic genes (AT2 receptor, Fas, Bax and Bcl-xS) have shown to have significant reduction by EGb- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi>-treated groups as compared to vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction of immunoreactivity of protein production of these genes, together with least nuclear green fluorescence observed in TUNEL, EGb, as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> drug, is concluded to have potent and promising therapeutic effect for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
