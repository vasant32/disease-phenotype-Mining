<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our studies examined the hypothesis that the distribution of cerebral injury after a focal ischemic insult in the immature rat pup is associated with the regional distribution of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity and that differences in the vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> between pup and adult might be related to differences in cofactor availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured NOS activity in well-defined regions prone to become either core or penumbra in controls and at different times (end of occlusion, 0.5 h, and 24 h reperfusion) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) from the right and left hemispheres in a 14- to 18-day-old rat pup filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> sham controls were also included. "Core" NOS activity for combined right and left hemispheres ranged from 113% to 217% more than "penumbral" regions in control and sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the three MCAO groups, marked decreases in ischemic core and penumbral NOS activity were seen; however, core NOS remained higher than penumbral regions bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of cofactor addition (10 microM tetrahydrobiopterin, 3 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24040">flavin adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi>, and 3 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24041">flavin mononucleotide</z:chebi>) on NOS activity were similar in "core" and "penumbral" regions in control and sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after 24 h MCAO, cofactor addition preferentially increased NOS activity in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-factor addition in the pup also had a greater effect on enhancing NOS activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions compared with the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater NOS activity in core regions in the rat pup, as in the adult, could in part, explain the increased vulnerability of that region to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NOS activity also can be influenced by the availability of cofactors and this effect may be greater in the immature animal </plain></SENT>
