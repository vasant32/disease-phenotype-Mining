<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A useful experimental model to study the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> without craniectomy is the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this model, an intraluminal suture is advanced from the internal carotid artery to occlude the base of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized procedures in terms of suture size, animal weight, and the details of intraluminal suture insertion are well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure can produce reversible occlusion after insertion of the intraluminal suture for a specified period of time, or a permanent occlusion by leaving the suture in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model has been useful in the study of both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in assessing interventional therapeutic approaches for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One approach has been the intravenous delivery of bone marrow-derived mescenchymal stem cells at various times after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological and magnetic resonance imaging have been used to quantify infarction volume in this model system </plain></SENT>
