<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently observed intranuclear MMP activity in ischemic brain neurons at early reperfusion, suggesting a possible role in nuclear matrix proteolysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that intranuclear MMP activity facilitates oxidative injury in neurons during early ischemic insult by cleaving PARP-1 and XRCC1, interfering with DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We induced a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increase activity of MMP-2 and -9, detected in the ischemic neuronal nuclei at 3 h, was associated with DNA fragmentation at 24 and 48 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intranuclear MMPs cleaved PARP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the rats with a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB1101, significantly attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced PARP-1 cleavage, increasing its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Degradation of XRCC1 caused by ischemic insult in rat brain was also significantly attenuated by BB1101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found elevation of oxidized DNA, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, in ischemic brain cells at 3 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BB1101 markedly attenuated the early increase of oxidized DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we found increased intranuclear MMP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that intranuclear MMP activity cleaves PARP-1 and XRCC1, interfering with oxidative DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This novel role for MMPs could contribute to neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ischemic injuries </plain></SENT>
