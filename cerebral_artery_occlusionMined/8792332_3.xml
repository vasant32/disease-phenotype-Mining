<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments were performed on 4-week-old, male Swiss mice (OF-1 Iffa Credo, France), 20-25 g at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated mice were subjected to simple exposure of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were injected with either MK-801, ifenprodil, JO 1784, JO 1994 or JO 1997 at the following time points after surgery; 5, 15, 45 min and 3, 6, 24, 30, 48 and 54 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were sacrificed 72 h after surgery and both ipsilateral and contralateral cortices were dissected in their entirety, weighed, and assayed for [3H]PK 11195 binding while the brain-stem and cerebellum were assayed for nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NO synthase) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment the area of ischaemic damage was determined planimetrically by means of an image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coagulation of the middle cerebral artery induced a marked enhancement of the ipsilateral cortical omega 3 peripheral-type <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> binding site (PTBB'S) densities, an increase in NO synthase activity in the brain-stem and cerebellum, and an increase in the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MK-801, ifenprodil, JO 1784, JO 1994 and JO 1997 demonstrated comparable neuroprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three indices of cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A down-regulation of cortical omega 3 peripheral-type <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> binding site (PTBB'S) densities and a decrease in NOS activity occurred following pharmacological intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to JO 1784, JO 1994 and JO 1997 have a bimodal effect on omega 3 PTBB'S densities </plain></SENT>
