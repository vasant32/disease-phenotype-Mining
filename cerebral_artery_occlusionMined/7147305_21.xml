<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evans blue extravasation and the lesion were limited to cortex at the burr hole site in occluded and sham operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion beyond the point of origin of the striate branches in the young rat results in neither neurological deficits, dye markings, nor histologic changes in the distal vascular field to indicate an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the young rodent collateral supply maintains the tissue in a viable state </plain></SENT>
