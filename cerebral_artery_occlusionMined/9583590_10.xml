<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In transcranial models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, a more consistent cerebral ischemic lesion is seen in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we performed intraluminal suture occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in SHR and compared its reproducibility with those in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male SHR and SD rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 2 h of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by an intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of regional cerebral blood flow figures taken throughout the experiment and lesion volume figures taken at 24 h after occlusion were made between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volume in the SHR group was 263.6+/-30.5 mm3 (mean +/- SD), significantly larger and less variable than that in the SD group (145.4+/-123.7 mm3, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Throughout the ischemic period there was a tendency for rCBF to be lower in the SHR group than in the SD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some animals of both groups, recirculation could not be produced by withdrawal of the suture from the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 9% in the SD group and 17% in the SHR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in SHRs is associated with a more consistent, reliable and reproducible volume of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the studies of temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, this model must be accompanied by the monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow so as to obtain more reliable results </plain></SENT>
