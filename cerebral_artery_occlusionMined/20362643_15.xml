<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct molecular analysis of tissue using mass spectrometry (MS) is a subject of much interest in the field of metabolomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most notably, imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) allows visualization of molecular distributions on the tissue surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> dynamics during ischemic injury, we performed IMS analysis on rat brain tissue sections with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and brain sections were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IMS analyses were conducted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) in positive ion mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the <z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">molecular structures</z:chebi>, the detected ions were subjected to tandem MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensity counts of the ion signals of m/z 798.5 and m/z 760.5 that are revealed to be a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, PC (16:0/18:1) are reduced in the area of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the signal of m/z 496.3, identified as a lyso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, LPC (16:0), was clearly increased in the area of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In IMS analyses, changes of PC (16:0/18:1) and LPC (16:0) are observed beyond the border of the injured area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together with previous reports--that PCs are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A(2) (<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2)) and produce LPCs,--our present results suggest that LPC (16:0) is generated during the injury process after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, presumably via <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activation, and that PC (16:0/18:1) is one of its precursor molecules </plain></SENT>
