<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of some of these mediators in outcome from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we treated rats with the growth-inhibitory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> neurocan, the growth-stimulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> glypican, or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi>-degrading enzyme chondroitinase ABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurocan, glypican, or chondroitinase ABC was infused directly into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavity for 7 d, beginning 7 d after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glypican and chondroitinase ABC reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity and increased microtubule-associated protein-2 immunoreactivity in the periinfarct region, and glypican- and chondroitinase ABC-treated rats showed behavioral improvement compared with neurocan- or saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glypican and chondroitinase ABC also increased neurite extension in cortical neuron cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glypican increased fibroblast growth factor-2 expression and chondroitinase ABC increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in these cultures, whereas no such effects were seen following neurocan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, treatment with glypican or enzymatic disruption of neurocan with chondroitinase ABC improves gross anatomical, histological, and functional outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in growth factor expression and neuritogenesis may help to mediate these effects </plain></SENT>
