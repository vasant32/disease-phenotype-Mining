<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to the brain damage, its expression and neuroprotective role in models of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of TNF-alpha convertase (TACE) in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and IT is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro models, the authors previously demonstrated that TACE is upregulated after ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors used a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> to investigate TACE expression, its involvement in TNF-alpha release, and its role in IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that TACE expression is increased after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning caused TNF-alpha release, an effect that was blocked by the selective TACE inhibitor BB-1101 (10 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data demonstrate that TACE is upregulated after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, plays a major role in TNF-alpha shedding in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, and has a neuroprotective role in IT </plain></SENT>
