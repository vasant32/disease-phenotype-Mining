<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with an intense <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, we reasoned that these agents may ameliorate injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 24 h before and at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> dramatically reduced infarction volume and improved neurological function following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we find that delayed therapy also significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains of the drug-treated animals displayed reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as evidenced by decreased immunoreactivity for microglial/macrophage markers and reduced protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for interleukin-1beta, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We argue that the beneficial effects of these drugs are likely due to reduced expression of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, which are known to exacerbate ischemic injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are of particular relevance to diabetic patients chronically treated with these agents who may benefit from the neuroprotective actions of these drugs </plain></SENT>
