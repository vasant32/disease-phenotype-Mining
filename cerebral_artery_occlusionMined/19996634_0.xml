<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of alteplase, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), in a simple and reproducible rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model induced by photoillumination with 12 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clinically equivalent dose of alteplase (3 mg/kg), which was administered just after thrombotic occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, significantly reopened the thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in 16 of 23 animals (69.6%) when compared with vehicle-treated animals (8 of 22 animals, 36.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, alteplase significantly reduced cerebral damage and improved neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that t-PA possesses neurotoxicity, the present findings suggest that alteplase was effective in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model due to reopening of thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This new model is very useful for investigating the efficacy of thrombolytic agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research, providing a condition similar to the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
