<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Alteplase was given intravenously at 0.6 mg/kg to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography-documented middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular outcome was evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography at 6 and 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> based on the modified Mori grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end points also included a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 1 at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> within 36 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of recanalization on clinical outcome was assessed by stepwise logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was noted in 51.7% on 6-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and 69.0% on 24-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 46.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression models, recanalization on either 6-hour or 24-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was an independent predictor for clinical outcome as well as the baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recanalization of an occluded middle cerebral artery can be provoked by 0.6 mg/kg intravenous alteplase and may induce a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates of recanalization and favorable outcome are comparable to that previously reported with the 0.9-mg/kg dose </plain></SENT>
