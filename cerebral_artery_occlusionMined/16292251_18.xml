<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative importance of different functions and binding partners of Hsp70 in ischemic protection is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore this question, we tested the ability of Hsp70-K71E, an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP)ase-deficient point mutant, and Hsp70-381-640, a deletion mutant lacking the ATPase domain and encoding the carboxyl-terminal portion, to protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like injury in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 70-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (-WT), -K71E, -381-640, and control vector plasmid LXSN were expressed in primary murine astrocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes overexpressing Hsp70-WT, -K71E, or -381-640 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly protected from 4 h combined oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and 24 h reperfusion when assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> assay or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining and cell counting (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains of rats were transfected with plasmids encoding Hsp70-WT, -K71E, -381-640, or LXSN 24 h before 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals that overexpressed either of the mutant proteins or Hsp70-WT had significantly better neurological scores and smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protection by both mutants was associated with reduced protein aggregation, as assessed by ubiquitin immunohistochemistry and reduced nuclear translocation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that the carboxyl-terminal portion of Hsp70 is sufficient for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that neither the ability to fold denatured proteins nor interactions with cochaperones or other proteins that bind the amino-terminal half of Hsp70 are essential to ischemic protection </plain></SENT>
