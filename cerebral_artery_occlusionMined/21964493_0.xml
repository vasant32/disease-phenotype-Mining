<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic injury is associated with the induction of a series of pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> such as cytokines and chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chemokine-like factor 1(CKLF1), as a novel human cytokine, displays chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to determine if CKLF1 was produced in the brain of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (TMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to characterize the expression of CKLF1 at different times after TMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result showed that almost no expression of CKLF1 was found in the sham-operated or contralateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CKLF1 expression significantly increased in the ischemic cerebral cortex and hippocampus, elevating at 12 h and peaking at 2 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CKLF1 positive staining was mainly present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the expression of CKLF1 increases after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, CKLF1 may be a potential therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
