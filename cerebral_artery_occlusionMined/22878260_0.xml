CUSSON, has been considered therapeutic agent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the effect of osthole on permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Osthole was administrated by gavage to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were assessed for neurological deficit after 24 h following MCAO, then their brains were evaluated to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of some inflammatory factors were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that MCAO animals pre-treated with osthole for 7 d showed significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurological tests compared with vehicle-treated MCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 24 h after occlusion in animals pre-treated with osthole versus the vehicle-treated MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO also dramatically caused some inflammatory factors increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment with osthole restored the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of these factors, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) of ischemic penumbra cortices, suggesting that osthole possessed the function of preventing brain against ischemic damage, while no significant difference was found in any of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> groups with or without osthole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that osthole may be a novel neuroprotective therapy in the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
