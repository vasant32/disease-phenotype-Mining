<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To target memory specifically, we devised a watermaze protocol to minimize the impact of sensory and motor impairments in female Lister-hooded rats exposed to proximal electrocoagulation of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were trained in a reference-memory task comprising 4 trials/day; trial 1 being a probe trial (platform absent for the first 60 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Training ended once animals reached a strict criterion based on the probe-trial performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Memory retention was tested 1, 7, and 28 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MCAO did not affect the number of days to reach criterion during acquisition or the time spent in target quadrant during retention testing, compared with sham or unoperated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, MCAO rats showed slightly poorer accuracy in crossing the platform location and increased thigmotactic swimming compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> are minimal in this rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, and suggest that previously published watermaze impairments are attributable to sensory and motor deficits but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend using probe trials and training to a predetermined performance criterion in future studies assessing watermaze <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
