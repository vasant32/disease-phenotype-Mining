<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rho-kinase inhibition reduces cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, but not endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase deficient (eNOS-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be related to Rho-kinase activation under hypoxic/ischemic conditions and impaired vasodilation because of downregulation of eNOS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further implicate Rho-kinase in impaired vascular relaxation during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we exposed isolated vessels from rat and mouse to 60 mins of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> reversibly abolished <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced eNOS-dependent relaxation, and that Rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil partially preserved this relaxation during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, hypothesized that if <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced Rho-kinase activation acutely impairs vasodilation in ischemic cortex, in vivo, then Rho-kinase inhibitors would acutely augment cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a mechanism by which they reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test this, we studied the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral hemodynamic effects of Rho-kinase inhibitors in ischemic core and penumbra during distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and eNOS-/- mice using laser speckle flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When administered 60 mins before or immediately after dMCAO, Rho-kinase inhibitors hydroxyfasudil and Y-27632 reduced the area of severely ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, hydroxyfasudil did not reduce the area of CBF deficit in eNOS-/- mice, suggesting that its effect on CBF within the ischemic cortex is primarily endothelium-dependent, and not mediated by its direct <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect on vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Rho-kinase negatively regulates eNOS activity in acutely ischemic brain, thereby worsening the CBF deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rapid nontranscriptional upregulation of eNOS activity by small molecule inhibitors of Rho-kinase may be a viable therapeutic approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
