<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine the impact of pretreatment levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> on arterial recanalization and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied, including assessment of transcranial Doppler artery patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological status was determined by NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and long-term outcome with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who recanalized after t-PA infusion had lower PAI-1 levels than those who remained occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients who achieved dramatic clinical recovery at 12 hours exhibited significantly lower PAI-1 levels as those independent (mRS&lt; or =2) at third month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a trend towards lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> p(a) in patients who achieved recanalization at 1 hour, whereas no relation was found between TAFI or homo-cysteine levels and recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a regression model was applied the only independent predictor of thrombolysis resistance was baseline PAI-1&gt;34 ng/ml, such that high PAI-1 levels interfere with tPA-induced recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, predicting a higher susceptibility towards clot-lysis resistance and poor out-come </plain></SENT>
