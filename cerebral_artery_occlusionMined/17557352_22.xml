<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) is implicated in the modulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the Niacin-mediated increase of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> regulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and thereby improves functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with or without different doses (40 and 80 mg/kg) of Niaspan, starting 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional tests were performed, and serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> and angiogenic factor expression were measured by immunohistochemistry, corneal neovascularization and capillary tube formation assay, and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Niaspan significantly increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level, promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic brain, and improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Niaspan also significantly increased corneal neovascularization compared with nontreatment control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying the Niaspan-induced vascular remodeling were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Niaspan increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), and phosphorylation of Akt, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), and Tie2 in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Niacin upregulated Ang1 expression in cultured brain endothelial cells and increased vascular endothelial growth factor, Ang1, and endothelial NOS expression in cultured astrocytes, and dose-dependently increased capillary tube formation compared with nontreatment control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NOS partially decreased Niacin-induced capillary tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase or knockdown of Tie2 substantially and significantly decreased Niacin-induced capillary tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Niacin increases <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, which may contribute to improvement of functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Ang1/Tie2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase/Akt, and endothelial NOS pathways appear to mediate Niacin-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
