<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 4 days after 2VO, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing neurons in CA1 subregions were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to MCAo and 2VO showed significant protection of CA1 neurons in both hippocampi, whereas rats which underwent sham MCAo and 2VO typically had severe bilateral destruction of CA1 neurons (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuron counts, ipsilateral medial CA1: 59.8 +/- 7.2 vs 16.6 +/- 7.8 (mean +/- s.e.m.); middle CA1: 50.0 +/- 4.7 vs 16.0 +/- 8.8; lateral CA1: 43.5 +/- 5.7 vs 13.8 +/- 6.3; contralateral, medial CA1: 52.3 +/- 6.3 vs 17.0 +/- 6.4; middle CA1: 43.3 +/- 4.7 vs 19.8 +/- 8.1; lateral CA1: 45.5 +/- 4.6 vs 26.0 +/- 10.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This neuronal tolerance was preceded by the early bilateral induction of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, which may in turn lead to expression of critical target genes that promote cell recovery </plain></SENT>
