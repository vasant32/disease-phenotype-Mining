<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation may recover this deficit by replacing damaged brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of transplantation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells or ES cell-derived neuron-like (ES-N) cells on behavioral function in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAO, ES or ES-N cells were transplanted into ipsilateral striata (but not the substantia nigra) of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplanted rats exhibited a gradual reduction in the number of rotations induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> compared to vehicle-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rats also showed a significant improvement in rota-rod performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 15 weeks after transplantation, immunoreactivities for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> transporter (DAT) in the striatum were significantly recovered in rats grafted with ES or ES-N cells compared to vehicle-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intrastriatal-transplantation of ES or ES-N cells improved the dopaminergic function and subsequently recover behavioral dysfunction in focal ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
