<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to quantitate selected structural changes involving astrocytes and endothelial cells within an area of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> created by the occlusion of a middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of these structural changes was correlated with alterations in the patency to a circulating <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> through the microvessels (&lt; or = 15 mu in diameter) located within the territory of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-five adult male Wistar rats had the right middle cerebral artery occluded after threading a nylon monofilament through the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated by either cardiovascular perfusion or decapitation and immersion fixation at intervals ranging between 30 minutes and 7 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomly selected animals from each experimental subgroup were injected intravenously with horseradish peroxidase (molecular weight 44 kd) approximately 20 minutes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progressive decline in the area fraction comprised by the vessels filled with horseradish peroxidase was preceded at 30 to 60 minutes by an increase in the surface area occupied (on a cross-section of a microvessel) by endothelial cells (both nucleus and cytoplasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was followed by an increase of 23.7% in the mean diameter of astrocytes nuclei and a decrease of approximately 35% in lumenal surface of the microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the occlusion of a large cerebral artery causes prompt swelling of endothelial cells and astrocytes; both of these early biological responses may interfere with erythrocyte circulation and oxygen delivery, which (after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>) are entirely dependent on the circulation provided by the collateral arterial connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Through its interference with microvascular patency and oxygen delivery, cell swelling may influence the rate at which neurons become necrotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this model of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> the number of necrotic neurons peaks approximately 72 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
