<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the neuroprotective potential of OPN to reduce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> using both in vitro and in vivo models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that incubation of cortical neuron cultures with OPN protects against cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of OPN depends on the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing motif as the protective effect of OPN in vitro was blocked by an RGD-containing hexapeptide, which prevents integrin receptors binding to their ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin treatment of cortical neuron cultures caused an increase in Akt and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, which is consistent with OPN-inducing neuroprotection via the activation of these protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the protective effect of OPN was reduced by inhibiting the activation of Akt and p42/p44 MAPK using LY294002 and U0126, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of OPN was also blocked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of OPN required new protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, intracerebral ventricular administration of OPN caused a marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that OPN is a potent neuroprotectant against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
