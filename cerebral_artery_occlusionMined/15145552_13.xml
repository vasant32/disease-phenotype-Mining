<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ltd.] was previously shown to mitigate delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion through inhibition of the enhanced production of S-100beta, while inducing a prompt symptomatic improvement that attained a significant level as early as 24h after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism underlying the prompt symptomatic improvement, the present study aimed to examine whether ONO-2506 modulates the level of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> ([Glu]e) in the rat subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this model, it had been shown that ONO-2506 reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improves the neurological deficits, and enhances the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of glial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters (GLT-1 and GLAST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The [Glu]e levels in the ischemic cortices were continuously measured using intracerebral microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alterations in the [Glu]e levels in the sham-operated and tMCAO-operated groups with or without drug administration were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the tMCAO groups, the [Glu]e level increased during tMCAO to a similar extent, returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on reperfusion, and increased again around 5h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the saline-treated group, however, the [Glu]e level further increased from 15 h on to reach about 280% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This secondary increase in the [Glu]e level in the late phase of reperfusion was prevented by ONO-2506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intracerebral infusion of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter inhibitor, l-trans-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi>-2,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35692">dicarboxylic acid</z:chebi>, at 24h after tMCAO induced an increase in the [Glu]e level, which was marked in both the sham-operated and ONO-2506-treated groups, but much less pronounced in the saline-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The above results suggest that functional modulation of activated astrocytes by pharmacological agents like ONO-2506 may inhibit the secondary rise of [Glu]e level in the late phase of reperfusion, leading to amelioration of delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
