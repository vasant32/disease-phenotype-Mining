<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients have neurological decline in the perioperative period, which contributes to long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The focus of this study is to characterize the incidence of, characteristics predictive of, and outcomes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative neurological deterioration in patients undergoing surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> Surgery Trial (IHAST) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 1001 patients and assesssed the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as neuroprotection during surgery to secure a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a radiographically confirmed SAH, were classified as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Grade I-III immediately prior to surgery, and underwent surgery to secure the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> within 14 days of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was performed preoperatively, at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively, and at time of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome variable was a dichotomized scoring based on an IHAST version of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in which a score of 1 represents a good outcome and a score &gt; 1 a poor outcome, as assessed at 90-days' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from IHAST were analyzed for occurrence of a postoperative neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and intraoperative variables were assessed for associations with occurrence of postoperative neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative variables and in outcomes between patients with and without postoperative neurological deterioration were compared with Fisher exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare variables reported as means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates associated with occurrence of postoperative deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> postoperative neurological deterioration was observed in 42.6% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>New focal motor deficit accounted for 65% of postoperative neurological deterioration, while 60% was accounted for using the NIHSS total score change and 51% by Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative neurological deterioration included: age, Fisher grade on admission, occurrence of a procedure prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery (ventriculostomy), timing of surgery, systolic blood pressure during surgery, ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> during surgery, history of abnormality in cardiac valve function, use of intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> during surgery, duration of anterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, intraoperative blood loss, and difficulty of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the 426 patients with postoperative neurological deterioration at 24 hours after surgery, only 46.2% had a good outcome (GOS score of 1) at 3 months, while 77.7% of those without postoperative neurological deterioration at 24 hours had a good outcome (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurological injury incurred perioperatively or in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative period accounts for a large percentage of poor outcomes in patients with good admission WFNS grades undergoing surgery for aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Avoiding surgical factors associated with postoperative neurological deterioration and directing investigative efforts at developing improved neuroprotection for use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery may significantly improve long-term neurological outcomes in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
