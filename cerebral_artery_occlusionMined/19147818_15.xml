<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine proteinase that is found in the intravascular space and the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a member of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor gene family found in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether the interaction between tPA and microglial LRP1 plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induces microglial activation in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and plasminogen-deficient (Plg(-/-)) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MCAO-induced microglial activation is significantly decreased in tPA-deficient (tPA(-/-)) mice and in mice that lack LRP1 in microglial cells (macLRP(-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant increase in microglial activation when tPA(-/-) mice received treatment with murine tPA after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment of macLRP(-) mice with tPA did not have an effect on the extent of microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, both the volume of the ischemic lesion as well as inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase production were significantly decreased in macLRP(-) mice and macLRP(-) microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results indicate that the interaction between tPA and LRP1 induces microglial activation with the generation of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the ischemic brain, suggesting a cytokine-like role for tPA in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
