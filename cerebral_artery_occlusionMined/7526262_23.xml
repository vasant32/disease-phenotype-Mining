<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) has been implicated as a mediator of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures, and its synthesis is acutely increased during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate possible mechanisms of hypothermic neuroprotection, we measured markers of NO synthesis--<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP) levels and NO synthase activity--during right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat under normothermic (36.5 degrees C) and mild hypothermic (33 degrees C) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentration in the right hemisphere versus the left under normothermic conditions at 10 and 20 minutes after MCAO (P &lt; 0.01), with a return to baseline levels by 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in cortical <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels in the right hemisphere versus the left was not observed with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a threefold increase in cGMP synthesis in the normothermic right cortex 10 minutes after MCAO (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This rise in cGMP did not occur in hypothermic animals, and the right to left cortical disparity in cGMP production was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the significant increase in NO synthase activity seen in the normothermic ischemic cortex was absent in hypothermic rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) modulates the burst of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthesis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may account, at least partially, for its cerebroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
