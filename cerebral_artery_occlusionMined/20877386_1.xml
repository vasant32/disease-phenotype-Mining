<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The degree of cellular injury within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ischaemic penumbra is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and experimental studies using the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> tracer fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) have shown retention of this tracer in the penumbra, but cellular outcome has not been well characterised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that macroscopically intact FMISO-retaining penumbral tissues would show evidence of microscopic injury, and that no FMISO retention would be seen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the distribution of FMISO retention, a <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29298">tritium</z:chebi>-labelled tracer (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29238">hydrogen-3</z:chebi> FMISO ([(3)H]FMISO)) was administered 5 minutes after induction of 2-hour temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coregistered brain histology and autoradiography at 24 hours revealed marked retention of FMISO within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 48% of the FMISO-retaining tissue was not infarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within this noninfarcted tissue, only 27% (17 of 64) of sampled regions showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, whereas 44% (28 of 64) showed injury to &gt;50% of neurons within the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether FMISO retention occurred after the tissue was already committed to infarction, FMISO was administered 4 to 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intense FMISO retention was consistently seen throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FMISO retention occurs both within the ischaemic penumbra and within the early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most penumbral tissues show evidence of selective cellular injury </plain></SENT>
