<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat was performed using an intraluminal suture approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and blood flow maps were acquired 2 hr following occlusion, and were compared with T2 images and histology at 7 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the lesion distributions from the diffusion maps and hypoxic autoradiographs were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood flow threshold for increased uptake of the hypoxic marker was approximately 34 +/- 7% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of diffusion or hypoxic images with perfusion maps allowed differentiation between four regions: 1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue; 2) a region of decreased perfusion but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diffusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uptake of hypoxic marker; 3) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and increased uptake of hypoxic marker; 4) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and low uptake of hypoxic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas for increased uptake of hypoxic marker and decreased diffusion are equivalent, indicating similar blood flow thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions of oligaemic misery perfusion, ischaemic misery perfusion and lesion core may be delineated with the combination of diffusion or hypoxic images and perfusion maps </plain></SENT>
