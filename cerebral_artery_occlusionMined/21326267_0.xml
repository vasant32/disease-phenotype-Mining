<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intravital or multiphoton microscopy and laser-speckle imaging have become popular because they allow live monitoring of several processes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Available <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> have limitations for these experiments; e.g., filament occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is difficult to perform under a microscope, whereas distal occlusion methods may damage the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the peri-arterial cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that placement of a 10% FeCl(3)-soaked filter paper strip (0.3 × 1 mm(2)) on the duramater over the trunk of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> through a cranial window for 3 minutes induced intraarterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> without damaging the peri-arterial cortex in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This caused a rapid regional cerebral blood flow decrease within 10 minutes and total occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segment under the filter paper in 17±2 minutes, which resulted in a typical cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of 27±4 mm(3) at 24 hours and moderate sensorimotor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant hemispheric swelling or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or mortality at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was obtained in half of the mice with tissue plasminogen activator, which allowed live monitoring of clot lysis along with restoration of tissue perfusion and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this relatively simple and noninvasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model is easy to perform under a microscope, making it suitable for live imaging and thrombolysis studies </plain></SENT>
