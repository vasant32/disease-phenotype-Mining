<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD11b/18 (Mac-1) integrin mediates stimulated neutrophil binding to endothelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the effect of administration of an anti-Mac-1 monoclonal antibody on cerebral ischemic cell damage in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats (n = 10) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; the anti-Mac-1 antibody was administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg i.v. at 1 hour of reperfusion and 1 mg/kg i.v. at 22 hours of reperfusion or an isotype-matched control antibody (n = 10) was administered using the same experimental protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 46 hours of reperfusion, and brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate population of rats given either vehicle (n = 8) or anti-Mac-1 antibodies (n = 9), intraparenchymal neutrophils were measured by means of a myeloperoxidase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lesion volume was significantly smaller (28%) in the anti-Mac-1 antibody group compared with the vehicle control group (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numbers of intraparenchymal polymorphonuclear cells were significantly reduced (P &lt; .05) in the cortex of the anti-Mac-1 antibody group compared with the vehicle control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that administration of anti-Mac-1 antibody 1 hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion results in significant reductions of ischemic cell damage and intraparenchymal neutrophils after transient (2-hour) focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
