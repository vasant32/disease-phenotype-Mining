<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the following conditions was maintained during MCAo: 1) Control--hematocrit and blood pressure were not manipulated; 2) Hypervolemic-Hemodilution/Normotension--the hematocrit was decreased to 30%; 3) Hypervolemic-Hemodilution/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>--the hematocrit was decreased to 30% and mean arterial pressure increased by 30 mmHg with phenylphrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, Evans Blue was administered, and its concentration determined by spectrophotometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evans Blue (micrograms (g-1 of brain tissue [mean +/- SD]) was greater in the Hypervolemic-Hemodilution/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> group (71 +/- 20) versus the Control (13 +/- 9) and Hypervolemic-Hemodilution/Normotension (17 +/- 10) groups (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other differences were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that during MCAo, hypervolemic-hemodilution/hypertensive therapy effects an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability in the early period of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
