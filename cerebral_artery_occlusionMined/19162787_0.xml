<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimated by continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) with short delay after tagging was sensitive to cerebral blood volume (CBV) change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The delayed hyperperfusion may indicate a CBV increase after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For confirmation of the delayed hyperperfusion, we investigated a transit-time dependency in CASL at two days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also acquired CBF using the dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) at the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the CBF in transient ischemic tissue is quite higher (179.1+/-21.6 ml/100g/min) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (121.0+/-6.9 ml/100g/min) with CASL using tagging delay of 0.4 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF estimated by DSC also show delayed hyperperfusion in transient ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm existence of physiological delayed hyperperfusion in transient ischemic area </plain></SENT>
