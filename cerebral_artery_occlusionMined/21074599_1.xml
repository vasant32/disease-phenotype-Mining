<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of AM and its receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, AM₂₂₋₅₂, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in rats using magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of AM (1.0 μg/kg), AM₂₂₋₅₂ (1.0 μg/kg), or saline was made before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of AM injection just after reperfusion were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, increases in T₂-weighted signals in the brain were clearly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, was greatly and significantly reduced by pre-treatment of AM (reduced by 53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> was significantly correlated with the volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of AM against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was more clearly observed in the cerebral cortex (reduced by 63%) than the striatum (reduced by 31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased T₂ relaxation time in the cortex was recovered partially by pre-treatment of AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment of AM had no effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment of AM₂₂₋₅₂ tended to exacerbate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In another line of experiment, cocktail administration of AM with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, a pineal product having neuroprotective potential as a free radical scavenger, failed to enhance the protective effects of AM alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present study clearly suggests the prophylactic effects of AM against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, especially the cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
