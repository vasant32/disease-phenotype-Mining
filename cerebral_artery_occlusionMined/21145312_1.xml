<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, excessive activation of microglia may destroy healthy neurons as well as damaged neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated neuroprotective effects of amgatine on hypoxic microglia using in vitro and in vivo models for transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For in vitro study, BV2 immortalized murine microglia were incubated with or without 100 Î¼M of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> in a closed anaerobic chamber for 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After recovery in normoxic condition for 20 h, cell viability and the amount of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> generation were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vivo study, 100mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> or equivalent volume of saline was intraperitoneally administered, and the left middle cerebral artery of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24h from occlusion, the cortex and striatum of the forebrains was evaluated to check the immunoreactivity with a microglial marker, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> attenuated <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced cytotoxicity and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production by BV2 microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">Agmatine</z:chebi> also decreased the activities of microglia and NOS induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, our findings reveal that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> may reduce microglial damages caused by transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for hypoxic neuronal injuries </plain></SENT>
