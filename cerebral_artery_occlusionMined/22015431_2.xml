<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the effects of remifentanil in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms linked to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 kinases, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and various cytokines were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an I/R insult consisting of 90 minutes' middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined after 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remifentanil (5 μg/kg/min) was given alone or combined with naltrindole (δ-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>; 1 mg/kg),<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> D-Phe</z:chebi>-Cys-Tyr<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29955,32725">-D-Trp</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="6" ids="44548">-Orn</z:chebi>-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2) (μ-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>; 1 mg/kg), or 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (κ-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>; 1 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Opioid <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> were administered 20 minutes before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remifentanil infusion was started 10 minutes before MCAO and continued throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group was without drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, and also those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6, were determined after 1, 3, and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Remifentanil significantly improved the functional outcome and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (69.0±24.3 mm(3) vs. 108.9±24.8 mm(3)), which were not affected by<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> D-Phe</z:chebi>-Cys-Tyr<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29955,32725">-D-Trp</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="6" ids="44548">-Orn</z:chebi>-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2) or 5'-guanidinonaltrindole, but were abolished by naltrindole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The I/R insult enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and the expression of TNF-α, which were significantly reduced by remifentanil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK nor the production of interleukin-6 was altered throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil may be neuroprotective against focal I/R injury, possibly through the activation of δ-opioid receptors and attenuation of ERK 1/2 activity and TNF-α production, in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
