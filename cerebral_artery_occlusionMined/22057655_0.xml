<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a primitive cell population, monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs), which can differentiate into mesenchymal, neuronal, and endothelial lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, MOMCs and macrophages were prepared from rat peripheral blood and transplanted intracranially into the ischemic core of syngeneic rats that had undergone a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, as evaluated by the corner test, were less severe in the MOMC-transplanted rats than in macrophage-transplanted or mock-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluations revealed that the number of microvessels that had formed in the ischemic boundary area by 4 weeks after transplantation was significantly greater in the MOMC-transplanted rats than in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood vessel formation was preceded by the appearance of round CD31(+) cells, which we confirmed were derived from the transplanted MOMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small numbers of bloodvessels incorporating MOMC-derived endothelial cells expressing a mature endothelial marker RECA-1 were detected at 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, MOMCs expressed a series of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoetin-1, and placenta growth factor (PlGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that the intracranial delivery of MOMCs enhances functional recovery by promoting neovascularization in a rat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
