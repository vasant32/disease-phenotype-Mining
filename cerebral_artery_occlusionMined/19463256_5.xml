<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, memantine (MN) an uncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) open channel blocker has been investigated for its suitable therapeutic time-window on the basis of its influence on behavioural and biochemical changes in rats subjected to transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MN (20 mg/kg, ip) was administered at pre, during and post ischemic state and the extent of neuroprotection was compared to ascertain its therapeutic time-window in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effect was assessed by measuring <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, Na+K+ATPase, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced neurological deficits, anxiogenic behaviour, histological changes, increased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels along with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of Na+K+ATPase, energy stores such as ATP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MN significantly restored <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase, Na+K+ATPase and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels on preischemic administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, MN reversed the altered neurological and behavioural paradigms significantly and prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> on preischemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it failed to exert any effect on energy metabolite (ATP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>) levels irrespective of the treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the present data, it is summarized that the suitable therapeutic time window of MN is preischemic phase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and it possesses only a subjective role in reversing ischemic brain biochemical alterations preferentially in favor of neuronal homeostasis </plain></SENT>
