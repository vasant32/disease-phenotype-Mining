<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of social isolation on neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and functional outcome after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male mice were socially isolated (housed individually) or pair housed with an ovariectomized female before induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, via transient intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), or SHAM surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, peri-ischemic social isolation decreases poststroke survival rate and exacerbates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The social influence on ischemic damage is accompanied by an altered neuroinflammatory response; specifically, central interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling is down-regulated, whereas peripheral IL-6 is up-regulated, in isolated relative to socially housed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, intracerebroventricular injection of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (10 ng) eliminates social housing differences in measures of ischemic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that central IL-6 is an important mediator of social influences on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
