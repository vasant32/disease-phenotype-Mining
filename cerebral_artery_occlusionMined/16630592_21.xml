<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of neuronal survival following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is crucial to the development of therapeutic interventions for victims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research in our laboratory has implicated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) as contributing to neuronal survival in response to toxic or ischemic brain insult, with in vivo models having focused on the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To take advantage of genetic alterations available in the mouse, we utilized a murine transient endovascular middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model to examine the influence of NF-kappaB on neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When brains were immunostained for the nuclear localization sequence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>) of the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, a unilateral increase in immunoreactivity was seen, especially in pyramidal cell layers of the ipsilateral (stroked) hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When transgenic mice lacking p50 were compared with non-transgenic counterparts using Fluoro-Jade, a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, both the hippocampus and striatum showed enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> at various survival times after 1 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus specifically, there was an eightfold increase in Fluoro-jade staining in the p50 knockout group vs. the non-transgenic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections double stained for Fluoro-Jade and NF-kappaB activity (using a mouse engineered with a NF-kappaB responsive promoter driving a LacZ gene to produce beta galactosidase) demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> only in regions sparsely showing NF-kappaB activity, and those demonstrating NF-kappaB activity failed to degenerate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that NF-kappaB participates in survival signaling following temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and thus may represent an attractive target for pharmacologic activation in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
