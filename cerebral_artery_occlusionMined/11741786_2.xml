<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of novel 4-arylpiperidines and 4-aryl-4-piperidinols (2a-f, 3a-f and 4a-f) was synthesized and evaluated for blocking effects on both neuronal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and T-type Ca(2+) channels and binding affinity for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D(2) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the compounds blockaded both ion channels with potency greater than or equal to flunarizine 1a which was adopted as a reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, these compounds had significantly reduced affinity for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D(2) receptors which is common in this class of structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compounds 2a-f, 3a-f and 4a-f exhibited potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> effects following systemic (ip) administration on audiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice, indicating their excellent brain permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective activity of 2a, 3a and 4a was also assessed in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These compounds significantly reduced neuronal damage without affecting ischemic hyperthemia, while flunarizine 1a produced only minor reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, 4a had 1.7-fold the potency in this MCAO model but only 1/20 the affinity for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D(2) receptors of 1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The superposition of 2a, 3a and 4a on the basis of analyses of systematic conformation and similar structure has revealed that the cinnamyl, phenacyl and phenoxypropanol groups are likely to be structurally and biologically equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the superposition of 2a and 2f shows that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ether</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi> groups occupy a similar space, suggesting that both groups act as a bioisostere for the blockade of ion channels; however, this is not the case for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D(2) receptors since only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi> compounds such as 2f had high affinity similar to flunarizine 1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compound 4a (SUN N5030) has a good pharmacological profile and may be useful in the alleviation and treatment of ischemic diseases </plain></SENT>
