<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several recent reports proposed that astrocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> might precede neuronal demise after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, contrary to the conventional view that astrocytes are more resistant to injury than neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there are findings supporting each of these opposing views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify these controversies, we assessed astrocyte viability after 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to neighboring neurons, astrocytes were alive and contained <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> across the ischemic area 6 h after reperfusion, and at the expanding outer border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-positive astrocytes had intact plasma membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes lost plasmalemma integrity much later than neurons: 19 +/- 22 (mean +/- standard deviation), 58 +/- 14 and 69 +/- 3% of astrocytes in the perifocal region became permeable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) at 6, 24, 72 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively, in contrast to 81 +/- 2, 96 +/- 3, 97 +/- 2% of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although more astrocytes in the cortical and subcortical core regions were PI-positive, their numbers were considerably less than those of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lysosomal rupture (monitored by deoxyribonuclease II immunoreactivity) followed a similar time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome-c</z:chebi> immunohistochemistry showed that astrocytes maintained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity longer than neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EM confirmed that astrocyte ultrastructure including mitochondria and lysosomes disintegrated much later than that of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also found that astrocytes died by a delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> without significantly activating apoptotic mechanisms although they rapidly swelled at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
