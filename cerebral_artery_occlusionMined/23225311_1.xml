<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (Bcl-2) enhances neurogenesis as well as supporting axonal growth after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether Bcl-2 overexpression plays a role in the formation of newborn striatonigral projection neurons in the adult rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We infused human Bcl-2-expressing plasmid (pBcl-2) into the lateral ventricle immediately after 30 min of MCAO, injected 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally to label proliferative cells, and microinjected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">fluorogold</z:chebi> (FG) into the substantia nigra at 11 weeks of reperfusion followed by multiple immunostaining of striatonigral projection neurons at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that pBcl-2 treatment significantly increased the number of newborn neurons (BrdU(+)-NeuN(+)) in the striatum ipsilateral to the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further detected newborn striatonigral projection neurons (BrdU(+)-FG(+)-NeuN(+)) in the ipsilateral striatum at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, the number of newborn striatonigral projection neurons (BrdU(+)-FG(+)) was significantly increased by pBcl-2 treatment compared to that by pEGFP, a control plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, we found that Bcl-2 overexpression in the brain enhanced the generation of newborn striatonigral projection neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This provides a potential strategy for promoting the reestablishment of neural networks and brain repair after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
