<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether inhibition of KCa3.1 (IKCa1/KCNN4), a calcium-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel that is involved in microglia and macrophage activation and expression of which increases on microglia in the infarcted area, has beneficial effects in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an HPLC/MS assay, we first confirmed that our small molecule KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 effectively penetrates into the brain and achieves micromolar plasma and brain concentrations after intraperitoneal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, we subjected male Wistar rats to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and administered either vehicle or TRAM-34 (10 or 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily) for 7 days starting 12 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both compound doses reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area by â‰ˆ 50% as determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> &amp; eosin staining on day 7 and the higher dose also significantly improved neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further observed a significant reduction in ED1(+)-activated microglia and TUNEL-positive neurons as well as increases in NeuN(+) neurons in the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that KCa3.1 blockade constitutes an attractive approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> because it is still effective when initiated 12 hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
