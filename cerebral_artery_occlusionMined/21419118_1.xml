<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> also leads to accumulation of microglia in the SVZ but their role for neurogenesis is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we developed a method for selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1)-expressing microglia population in the SVZ by intraventricular injection of the immunotoxin Mac-1-saporin in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the vast majority of Mac-1+ cells were Iba-1+ microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mac-1+ population was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and included both a small proliferative pool of cells, which was not affected by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and a larger subpopulation that changed morphologically into a semi-activated state in response to the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This subpopulation did not increase its expression of the phagocytic marker ED1 but exhibited high levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2), associated with alternative microglia activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minor portion of the SVZ Mac-1+ cells originated from the blood early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but this macrophage population became much more substantial at later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost 80% reduction of Mac-1-expressing microglia, caused by Mac-1 saporin delivered just before and at 1 week after MCAO, did not alter the numbers of newly formed neuroblasts in the striatum or their migratory distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the Mac-1-expressing microglia in the SVZ do not play a major role either for the number of neuroblasts which exit the SVZ or their migration in the striatum early following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
