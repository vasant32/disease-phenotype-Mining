<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate changes in the expression of prepro-orexin and the orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six and twenty-four hours following MCAO, increased OX1R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression (as assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry) was detected in the ischaemic cortex compared with control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, however, no increase in OX2R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected at any time-point and prepro-orexin levels in the cortex were below assay detection levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that orexin receptor localization is altered following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of selective orexin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> will be crucial in establishing a role for this family of novel <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the mechanisms underlying ischaemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
