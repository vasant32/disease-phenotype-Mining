<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in mediating ischemic and reperfusion damage in multiple organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting reports exist on the role of individual PKC isozymes in cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor selective for deltaPKC, deltaV1-1, we found that deltaPKC inhibition reduced cellular injury in a rat hippocampal slice model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> [oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)] when present both during OGD and for the first 3 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We next demonstrated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> delivery to the brain parenchyma after in vivo delivery by detecting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-conjugateddeltaV1-1 and by measuring inhibition of intracellular deltaPKC translocation, an indicator of deltaPKC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delivery of deltaV1-1 decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in an in vivo rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, deltaV1-1 had no effect when delivered immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, delivery at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, at 1 hr, or at 6 hr of reperfusion reduced injury by 68, 47, and 58%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous work has implicated deltaPKC in mediating apoptotic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore determined whether deltaPKC inhibition altered apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or cell survival pathways in our models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that deltaV1-1 reduced numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling-positive cells, indicating <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp>, increased levels of phospho-Akt, a kinase involved in cell survival pathways, and inhibited BAD (Bcl-2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> protein) protein translocation from the cell cytosol to the membrane, indicating inhibition of proapoptotic signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support a deleterious role for deltaPKC during reperfusion and suggest that deltaV1-1 delivery, even hours after commencement of reperfusion, may provide a therapeutic advantage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
