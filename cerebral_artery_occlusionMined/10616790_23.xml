<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to occur early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This change may be a useful indicator of brain tissue adversely affected by inadequate blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that loss of membrane ion homeostasis and depolarization can occur simultaneously with the drop in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also investigated was whether elevation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> ([GLU]e) would occur before <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-speed MRI of the trace of the diffusion tensor (15-second time resolution) was combined with simultaneous recording of the extracellular direct current (DC) potential and on-line [GLU]e from the striatum of the anesthetized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a control period, data were acquired during remote middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>-induced global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After either focal or global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was reduced by 10 to 25% before anoxic depolarization occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After either insult, the time for half the maximum change in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was significantly shorter than the corresponding DC potential parameter (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The [GLU]e remained at low levels during the entire period of varying <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and DC potential and did not peak until much later after either ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes can occur before membrane depolarization and that high [GLU]e has no involvement in the early rapid <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease </plain></SENT>
