<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autophagy is a conserved mechanism responsible for the continuous clearance of unnecessary organelles or misfolded proteins in lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three types of autophagy have been reported in the difference of substrate delivery to lysosome: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these types, CMA is a unique autophagy system that selectively degrades substrates detected by heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, autophagic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> has been reported to be involved in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>; however, the contribution of CMA to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/survival after ischemic stress has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined whether quantitative alterations in LAMP-2A, which is the key molecule in CMA, would modulate neuronal cell survival under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of Neuro2A cells in a hypoxic chamber (1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) increased the level of LAMP-2A and induced accumulation of LAMP-2A-positive lysosomes in the perinuclear area, which is a hallmark of CMA activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activation of CMA in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was also confirmed by the GAPDH-HaloTag CMA indicator system at the single cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, we asked whether CMA was involved in cell survival during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blocking LAMP-2A expression with siRNA increased the level of cleaved caspase-3 and the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>-positive cells after hypoxic stress regardless of whether macroautophagy could occur, whereas the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolic acid</z:chebi>, a potent CMA activator, rescued <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we asked whether CMA was activated in the neurons after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of LAMP-2A was significantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere seven days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CMA is activated during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and contributes to the survival of cells under these conditions </plain></SENT>
