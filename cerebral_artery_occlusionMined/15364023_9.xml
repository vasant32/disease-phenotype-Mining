<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the distribution and time course of hippocampal neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were studied following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 60% of the animals, more than 90% of CA1 pyramidal neurons showed strong nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining at day 3 with fragmentation and marginalization of the nuclei in approximately 40% of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells decreased within the next days, but 30 days after MCAO, some apoptotic neurons were still present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the expression of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptors GFRalpha1, GFRalpha2, and GFRalpha3 using triple immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals showing marked hippocampal DND, the neuronal staining for GFRalpha1, GFRalpha3, and GDNF decreased prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of TUNEL staining in CA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, some apoptotic neurons still expressed GFRalpha3, whereas only few showed GFRalpha1 immunoreactivity, indicating that GFRalpha1 may be beneficial for the survival of hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that reduced expression of GDNF and impairment of GFRalpha1/3 may contribute to hippocampal DND after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
