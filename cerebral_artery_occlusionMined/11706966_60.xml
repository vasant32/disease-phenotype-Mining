<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The adult rodent brain is capable of generating neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone, and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, throughout the life of the animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signals that regulate progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that administration of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, (Z)-1-[N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) aminio]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NONOate), to young adult rats significantly increases cell proliferation and migration in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with DETA/ NONOate also increases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of DETA/NONOate to rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly increases cell proliferation and migration in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus, and these rats exhibit significant improvements of neurological outcome during recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of DETA/NONOate significantly increases cortical levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate both in ischemic and nonischemic rats, supporting the role of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in promoting cell proliferation and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data indicate that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is involved in the regulation of progenitor cells and neurogenesis in the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> delivered to the brain well after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may have therapeutic benefits </plain></SENT>
