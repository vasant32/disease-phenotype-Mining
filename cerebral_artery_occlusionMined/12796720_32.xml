<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of this study is that transgenic mice overexpressing HSP70 (HSP70 Tg) show reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release into cytosol and diminished apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in comparison to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (Wt) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) was produced by intraluminal suture cannulation in HSP70 Tg and Wt mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was evaluated with DNA gel electrophoresis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) 24 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release into cytosol was assessed with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry 4 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi> levels in the cytosolic fraction were significantly reduced and immunoreactivity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> in both cortex and striatum was significantly less in HSP70 Tg mice compared with Wt mice after 4-h pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA laddering, which was clearly observed in Wt mice, was markedly attenuated in HSP70 Tg mice 24 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in HSP70 Tg mice compared with Wt mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results are consistent with an association between overexpression of HSP70 and reduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release with subsequent DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the HSP70-mediated neuroprotective effect observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
