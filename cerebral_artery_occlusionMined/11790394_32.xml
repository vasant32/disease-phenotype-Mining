<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=70) and euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days (10 per time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining and immunostaining were performed using antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine, neuronal nuclear antigen and glial fibrillary acidic protein after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonischemic rats (n=10), single layers of ependymal and choroid plexus cells do not react with bromodeoxyuridine, neuronal nuclear antigen or glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual subependymal cells express glial fibrillary acidic protein and bromodeoxyuridine, but not neuronal nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, increased bromodeoxyuridine reactivity was present in multiple layers of ependymal cells and nodules of subependymal cells and in scattered choroid plexus cells from 2 to 28 days and peaked at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactivity colocalized with neural phenotypes of neuronal nuclear antigen (approximately 0.1-3.5%) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (approximately 8.6%) immunoreactivity in cells in the ventricular zone and the subventricular zone, as well as in the choroid plexus of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
