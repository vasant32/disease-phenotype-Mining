<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that after 2 h MCAO, GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunoreactivity profoundly increased in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cerebral cortex, with peaks at 2 h after reperfusion, then declined dramatically at 12 and 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although EA given immediatelly after MCAO couldn't elevate the peaks of GDNF expression, it obviously raised the GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunoreactivity levels at 12 h after reperfusion, delayed the declining trends of GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunoreactivity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EA could upregulate GDNF expression after ischemic insult, elongating the duration of upregulated GDNF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may be one of the mechanisms of EA anti-ischemic injury by augmenting endogenous protective mechanism </plain></SENT>
