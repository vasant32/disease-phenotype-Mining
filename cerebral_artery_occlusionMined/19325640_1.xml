<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a controversy, whether intravenously administered human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) migrate to the brain, differentiate and improve recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 1-3 x10;6 cells from non-cultured (non-committed) mononuclear HUCBC fraction were intravenously infused 1, 2, 3 or 7 days after a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found few human cells only in the ischemic area, localized mostly around blood vessels with few positive cells in the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Timing of HUCBC delivery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> at the time of delivery, had no effect on the number of human cells detected in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of HUCBC did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and did not improve neurologic deficits after MCAo, suggesting that HUCBC failed to migrate/survive in the ischemic brain and did not provide significant neurological benefits </plain></SENT>
