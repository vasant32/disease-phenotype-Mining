<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current investigation examined the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in central autonomic regulatory nuclei on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> resulting from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments were done in anaesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of MCAO on autonomic tone was assessed by monitoring vagal and renal efferent nerve activities before and following systemic administration of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> or saline and the bilateral microinjection of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ICI 182, 780, into several autonomic nuclei (the intrathecal space of the spinal cord, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, rostral ventrolateral medulla, parabrachial nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala or ventral posteromedial thalamus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autonomic reflex function was evoked using intravenous injection of increasing doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (0.025-0.1 mg/kg) and the peak changes in heart rate and blood pressure were plotted to obtain the baroreflex sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of ICI 182, 780 in the intrathecal space of the spinal cord, nucleus ambiguous, nucleus tractus solitarius, rostral ventrolateral medulla, parabrachial nucleus, or central nucleus of the amygdala prior to the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> resulted in a significant attenuation (ranging from 79% to 94 %) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced recovery of autonomic function following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blocking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors in the ventral posteromedial thalamus had no effect on the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> to prevent the MCAO-induced changes in autonomic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated recovery of autonomic function following MCAO is dependent on the availability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors in several forebrain and brainstem autonomic nuclei </plain></SENT>
