<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible reasons why some of the authors have not seen severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in their experiments include differences in surgical technique, the strain of animals, the type of the anesthesia, and the occluder filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the changes in the core temperature of rats using different types of filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h with three different types of filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in the temperature were continuously monitored during occlusion and for the next 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups with uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and with controlled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> core temperature were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the necrotic and penumbral areas were measured 4 and 48 h after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was detected using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was found between the size of the occluder filament and the time-course and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the size of the filament correlated well with the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at both 4 and 48 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that filament size is a major contributor to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and the development of brain damage in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results call attention to the need to standardize the methods used to screen for therapeutic agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
