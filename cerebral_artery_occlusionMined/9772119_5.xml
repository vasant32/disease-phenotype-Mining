<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that concurrent administration of drugs ameliorating brain damage via different mechanisms would result in a synergistic neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective efficacy of two clinically available drugs - the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> and calcium-channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4470">dextromethorphan</z:chebi> (DM) and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> tirilazad - were studied in monotherapy and in combination in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min of middle-cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by an intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatments (n=10 each): (1) vehicle-treated controls, (2) DM, (3) tirilazad, (4) DM+tirilazad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drugs or vehicles were administered 15 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was bilaterally recorded by continuous laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were quantified by daily neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed planimetrically after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DM prevented post-ischemic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tirilazad did not influence LCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy with DM or tirilazad improved neurological function and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 45% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy failed to influence neurological recovery and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although, from pharmacological point of view, a synergistic neuroprotective effect is expected, combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4470">dextromethorphan</z:chebi> and tirilazad may lead to mutual inhibition or potentiate adverse effects </plain></SENT>
