<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, birth to 18 years, is a significant cause of long-term disability in the United States; however, there is currently little experimental data on the pathophysiology of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> owing to lack of animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel mouse model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to characterize the sex-specific response of the adolescent brain to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and assess the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> at this developmental stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postnatal day 20 to 25 mice were subjected to 90 minutes experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> via the intraluminal filament middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model and ischemic damage assessed 22 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed 22 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to determine the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment on the proapoptotic gene Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic injury did not differ between male and female juvenile (postnatal day 20-25) mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> reduced ischemic injury in female mice, whereas having no effect in juvenile males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor expression were observed on postnatal day between 20 males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> minimized the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increase in the proapoptotic gene Bax in female mice, whereas having no effect on Bax induction in the male brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has fundamentally different effects in the juvenile brain compared with the adult, as evidenced by the lack of sex difference in ischemic injury in the murine postnatal day 20 to 25 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model and the sexually dimorphic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
