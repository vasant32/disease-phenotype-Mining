<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral grafts of NSPCs can exert beneficial effects after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through neuronal replacement, trophic actions, neuroprotection, and modulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have explored whether human fetal striatum-derived NSPC-grafts influence striatal neurogenesis and promote recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-damaged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T cell-deficient rats were subjected to 1h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human fetal NSPCs or vehicle were implanted into ipsilateral striatum 48h after MCAO, animals were assessed behaviorally, and perfused at 6 or 14weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grafted human NSPCs survived in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, and a subpopulation had differentiated to neuroblasts or mature neurons at 6 and 14weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numbers of proliferating cells in SVZ and new migrating neuroblasts and mature neurons were higher, and numbers of activated microglia/macrophages were lower in the ischemic striatum of NSPC-grafted compared to vehicle-injected group both at 6 and 14weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A fraction of grafted NSPCs projected axons from striatum to globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NSPC-grafted rats showed improved functional recovery in stepping and cylinder tests from 6 to 12weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show, for the first time, that intrastriatal implants of human fetal NSPCs exert a long-term enhancement of several steps of striatal neurogensis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The grafts also suppress striatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and ameliorate neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the idea that combination of NSPC transplantation and stimulation of neurogenesis from endogenous NSPCs may become a valuable strategy for functional restoration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
