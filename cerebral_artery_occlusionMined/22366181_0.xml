<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, systemic alteration of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related gene expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brains and in brains with a high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status after ischemic-reperfusion has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a polymerase chain reaction array system, we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-interacting protein (Txnip) is induced by both <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that Txnip <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is induced by ischemic-reperfusion injury and that Txnip is located in the cytoplasm of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and subsequent reoxygenation without <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and in vivo administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16348">3-nitropropionic acid</z:chebi> also promoted an increase in Txnip in a time-dependent manner, indicating that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> without <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> can induce Txnip expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> inhibit induction of Txnip after OGD and reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction array with ischemic and hyperglycemic-ischemic samples, we confirmed that enhanced expression of Txnip was observed in hyperglycemic-ischemic brains after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, transfection of Txnip small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> into primary neurons reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release after OGD and reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report showing that Txnip expression is induced in neurons after oxidative or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stress under either ischemic or hyperglycemic-ischemic conditions, and that Txnip is proapoptotic under these conditions </plain></SENT>
