<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 6h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and assessment of neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 6 patients, four women, mean age 63 +/- 18 years, with severe neurologic deficit within 6h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and with no spontaneous improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was embolic in 3, and thrombotic in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were submitted to a head CT scan followed by either a cerebral angiography in 3 patients, or a transcranial Doppler, in the other 3 for assessment of arterial obstruction, and patency after thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA, IV, over 60 min in 5 patients, and 0.5 mg/kg by intra-arterial infusion, over 60 min, in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the beginning a bolus of 10% of the total dose was delivered during 1 to 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Head scan was repeated 24h and 7 days after treatment to detect ischemic areas and hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was observed in 5 patients and posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obstruction was cleared in 4 patients with persistence of the patency after 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A complete neurologic recovery was found in one patient, and a partial recovery in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two patients there was failure of arterial recanalization with no neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic tissue, without neurologic worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in one patient due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial patency with thrombolytic therapy was effective in 4 of our 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients also disclosed a certain degree of neurologic improvement, rt-PA can be successfully used in selected patients up to 3h of the event <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, as shown in randomized studies </plain></SENT>
