<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Riluzole at 4 or 8 mg/kg i.v. significantly reduced the cortical ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the most effective dose of 8 mg/kg, the time evolution of the lesion was assessed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) repeated on the same animals after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI obtained at 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO showed a progressive increase of the ischemic lesion, except in the cortex of the riluzole-treated rats (8 mg/kg i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no difference between lesion volumes as measured by MRI or by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that MRI may be a valuable method to quantify in vivo the neuroprotective profile of a drug </plain></SENT>
