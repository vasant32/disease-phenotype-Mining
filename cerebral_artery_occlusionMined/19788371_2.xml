<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats receiving HUCB cells have a less severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> compared to MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the interaction between HUCB cells and the main resident immune cells of the brain (microglia) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary microglial cultures were incubated for 2 h in no oxygen (95% N, 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) and low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1%) media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear HUCB cells were added to half the cultures at the beginning of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microglial viability was determined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> diacetate/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (FDA/PI) labeling and cytokine expression using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some studies, CD11b+ or CD19+ cells isolated from the HUCB mononuclear fraction with magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS) were used instead of the mononuclear fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-culturing mononuclear HUCB cells with microglia decreased viability of the microglia during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the microglial monocultures, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> significantly increased release of IL-1beta compared to normoxia, while adding HUCB cells in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> condition decreased IL-1beta concentrations to the same level as in the normoxia monocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both CD11b+ and CD19+ HUCB cells decreased microglial viability during normoxia and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that HUCB cells may produce a soluble factor that decreases viability of microglia </plain></SENT>
