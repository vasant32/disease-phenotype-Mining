<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurons die during the first few weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, thus impairing total recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the neovascularization process involves different cell types and various growth factors, most cell therapy protocols are based on the biological effects of single-cell-type populations or on the administration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> populations of progenitors, namely human cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells, with scarce vascular progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tight cooperation between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells/pericytes is critical for the development of functional neovessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that neuroblast survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain depends on mature vascular network formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we injected a combination of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs), isolated from human umbilical cord blood, into a murine model of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The co-administration of SMPCs and EPCs induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and vascular remodeling in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, where vessels exhibited a more mature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activation of vessel growth resulted in the maintenance of neurogenesis and neuroblast migration to the peri-ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a mature vascular network is essential for neuroblast survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and that co-administration of EPCs and SMPCs may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
