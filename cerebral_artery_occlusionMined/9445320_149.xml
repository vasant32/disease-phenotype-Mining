<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> by CT scan, patients with abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> likely to receive treatment within 6 hours who satisfied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical eligibility criteria underwent carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients displaying Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 0 or 1 occlusion of the M1 or M2 middle cerebral artery were randomized 2:1 to receive rpro-UK (6 mg) or placebo over 120 minutes into the proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization efficacy was assessed at the end of the 2-hour infusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> causing neurological deterioration was assessed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 105 patients who underwent angiography, 59 were excluded from randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 46 patients randomized, 40 were treated with rpro-UK (n=26) or placebo (n=14) a median of 5.5 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was significantly associated with rpro-UK (2P=.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation causing neurological deterioration within 24 hours of treatment occurred in 15.4% of the rpro-UK-treated patients and 7.1% of the placebo-treated patients (2P=.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both recanalization and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> frequencies were influenced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial local rpro-UK infusion was associated with superior recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this regimen, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose influenced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> frequency and recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> remains a concern, this study suggests that recanalization is enhanced with rpro-UK and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
