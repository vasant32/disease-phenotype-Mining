<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of the phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (p-STAT3) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (PGZ) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the increase in p-STAT3 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is mediated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor α is also obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of p-STAT3, PPARγ, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor α against ischemic brain damage after PGZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female Wistar rats subjected or not subjected to bilateral oophorectomy were injected with 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg PGZ 2 days, 1 day, and 1 hour before 90-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-reperfusion and compared with vehicle-control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was larger in ovariectomized than in nonovarietomized rats; it was reduced by PGZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inversely with the reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, PPARγ, and p-STAT3 but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor α in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area were increased in PGZ-treated compared with vehicle-control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in PPARγ and p-STAT3 was associated with the transactivation of antiapoptotic and survival genes and the reduction of caspase-3 in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of PPARγ or STAT3 abolished the PGZ-induced neuroprotection and the increase in p-STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, p-STAT3 increased by PGZ was bound to PPARγ and the complex translocated to the nucleus to dock to the response element through p-STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the activation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of p-STAT3 and PPARγ by PGZ is essential for neuroprotection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that PGZ may be of benefit even in postmenopausal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
