<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To establish a less invasive and reproducible focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model in the rat, we adopted a 2-laser system (ie, photothrombosis and YAG laser-induced reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded by 568-nm <z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi> laser and intravenous infusion of the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and was recanalized by 355-nm ultraviolet laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was determined by laser-Doppler flowmetry at the penumbral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined at 3 days after distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain temperature determined with infrared thermography was maintained within an acceptable range of approximately 1 degrees C upper shift of the center of brain temperature distribution during <z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi> or YAG laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average of the values (23 experiments; n=163) of coefficient of variation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 21+/-6%, indicating high reproducibility of this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, cerebral blood flow was decreased to 32+/-16% of the control values and was increased to 98+/-21% after YAG laser-induced reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in these rats was 61+/-18 mm3 (coefficient of variation=30%; n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have characterized a highly reproducible focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model utilizing a 2-laser system, one to induce thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and the other to facilitate reperfusion </plain></SENT>
