<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Recently, two different cyclooxygenase (COX) genes, COX-1 and -2, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, topographic and chronological profiles of COX-2 messenger (m)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were investigated using in situ hybridization after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats undergoing permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were decapitated at 30 and 90 minutes and at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, and rats undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> were decapitated at 4, 8, and 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion that lasted for either 30 or 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After brief transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced in the whole <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, adjacent cortex (cingulate cortex), and distant brain regions such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, COX-2 mRNA was not induced in the ischemic core (lateral striatum) but only in the penumbral area (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long transient and permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion did not induce c-fos and COX-2 mRNAs in the ischemic core but strongly induced both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in the penumbral area (medial striatum and periphery of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortex) and adjacent cortex (cingulate cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In brain regions distant from the ischemic territory, although c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced in the thalamus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus after extended transient and permanent occlusion, COX-2 mRNA was only induced in the bilateral hippocampi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of COX-2 mRNA persisted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations even at 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of COX-2 mRNA induction was apparently different from that of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results pertaining to COX-2 mRNA agree well with the previous observations of changes in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> metabolism induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, whether this induction of the COX-2 gene contributes to the histopathological outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
