<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the mechanism of ischemic cellular injury in this animal, we tested the hypothesis that increased synthesis of TNFα augments neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, calcium dysregulation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male TNFα-transgenic (TNFα-Tg) and non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates underwent reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 hour followed by 1 hour of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical mitochondria were isolated from injured (ipsilateral) and uninjured (contralateral) hemispheres of ischemic rats or from pooled hemispheres of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATP synthesis was attenuated in non-ischemic TNFα-Tg rats, demonstrated by reduction of state III and respiratory control ratio, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and earlier formation of the calcium-induced membrane permeability transition pore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After MCAO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction was augmented more significantly in ischemic TNFα-Tg brain mitochondria than in non-Tg rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction may be caused by increased brain levels of TNFα without physiological stress but will be exacerbated after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ischemic stress and synthesis of inflammatory cytokines synergistically augment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction to promote neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
