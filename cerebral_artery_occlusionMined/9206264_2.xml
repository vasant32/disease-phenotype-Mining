<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was significantly reduced 2 h after MCAO following administration of NBP at the dose of 80, 160 and 240 mg.kg-1, the percentage of reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was 49.0%, 69.5% and 85.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of infarction and the score of neurological deficit were also reduced significantly following pretreatment with NBP at the dose of 80 mg.kg-1 per day for 7 days by the end of the final dosage 24 h before MCAO or at the single dose of 160 mg.kg-1 1 h before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that NBP has therapeutic and preventive effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and imply that NBP has the action of attenuating neuronal damage after delayed cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the level of calcium ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) in rat intrasynaptosomes was determined using fura-2 (a fluorescence indicator) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that NBP can not lower the rise of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by 30 mmol.L-1 KCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of NBP on [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i overload induced by excitatory amino acid remains to be studied </plain></SENT>
