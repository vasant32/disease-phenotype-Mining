<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF CASE: An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patient presented with a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and underwent emergent catheter based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clot length was determined using pretreatment thin section NCCT and was independently confirmed by the pathologist after whole clot extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concordance between the NCCT measured clot length and the pathological examination in this case provides additional support for the accuracy of using thin section NCCT data to determine clot length in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
