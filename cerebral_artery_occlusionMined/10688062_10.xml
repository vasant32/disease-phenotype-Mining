<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently isolated bcl-w gene encodes a pro-survival member of the bcl-2 family, which is widely expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether bcl-w plays a role in determining cell survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, regional bcl-w protein expression was studied in rat brain 2, 6, 24 and 72 h following 20 min temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> increased bcl-w protein expression within the caudate putamen and parietal cortex, as well as causing milder increases within frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemically bcl-w was expressed within neurons (frontal and parietal cortex) and glia (caudate putamen) 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that bcl-w could play a role in determining cell survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
