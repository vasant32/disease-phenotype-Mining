<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is increasingly clear that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a negative regulator of neuronal cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we found that PTEN/mTOR is critical for controlling neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male rats were subjected to MCAO (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) followed by pretreating with bpv (pic), a potent inhibitor for PTEN, or by intra-cerebroventricular infusion of PTEN siRNA. bpv (pic) significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that although bpv (pic) did not affect brain injury-induced mTOR protein expression, bpv (pic) prevented decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR, and the subsequent decrease in S6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, down-regulation of PTEN expression also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and increased phospho-mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PTEN deletion prevents neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting from ischemic brain injury and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by increasing the injury-induced mTOR phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
