<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main component of the safflower yellow pigments, the aqueous extract of safflower florets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here an experimental study for evaluating HSYA for their neuroprotective qualities on rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (60 min) and reperfusion (24h), an experimental model in which excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our data, biochemical analysis of tissue proteins showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury resulted in significant elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23019">carbonyl groups</z:chebi> and nitrotyrosine in the brain of I/R in comparison to sham controls, indicating the occurrence of oxidative/nitrative modification to brain proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HSYA-treatment (1, 5 and 10mg/kg) inhibited I/R-induced protein oxidation and nitration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX), the enzyme implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> of cerebral I/R, displayed overexpression in I/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated 12/15-LOX activity, estimated by the level of its metabolite 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>), was also induced by the challenge of cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of HSYA 1, 5 and 10mg/kg reduced the upregulation of 12/15-LOX expression and activity in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increase in blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability evaluated by IgG leakage, Evans blue extravasation, and brain water content, respectively, was markedly alleviated by HSYA, indicating its protection against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following I/R insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate the neuroprotective properties of HSYA, which may be at least in part due to its potential to reduce protein oxidation and nitration, inhibit the upregulation of 12/15-LOX, and attenuate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown </plain></SENT>
