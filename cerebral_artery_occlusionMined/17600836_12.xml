<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> mediator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) exhibits diverse biologic activity in a variety of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> receptor subtypes (EP1-4) are involved in various physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions, but differ in tissue distribution, ligand-binding affinity, and coupling to intracellular signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the role of the EP1 receptor, physiologic parameters (mean arterial blood pressure, pH, blood gases PaO2 and PaCO2, and body temperature), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were studied in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and EP1 knockout (EP1-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 60 min, and absolute CBF was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of EP1 receptor on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in neuronal cultures was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no differences were observed in the physiologic parameters, CBF was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in EP1-/- mice than in WT mice, suggesting a role for this receptor in physiologic and pathophysiologic control of vascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, neuronal cultures derived from EP1-/- mice were more resistant (90.6 +/- 5.8% viability) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> than neurons from WT mice (39.6 +/- 17.2% viability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EP1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SC-51089 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> each attenuated the neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi> EP1 receptor plays a significant role in regulating CBF and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that pharmacologic modulation of the EP1 receptor might be a means to improve CBF and neuronal survival during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
