<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Adhesive Removal (sticky-tape) test is a commonly used test of somatosensory dysfunction following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test requires several days of pre-training prior to surgery, which can be time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our results with an improved version of the sticky-tape test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to either sham surgery (n = 4) or right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) using an intraluminal filament (n = 9), followed by a 10-day survival period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On post-operative days (POD) 1, 3, 7, and 10 animals underwent both the conventional sticky-tape test (CST) with measurement of the time to remove the stimulus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">trs</z:e>), as well as a modified sticky-tape test (MST), in which a non-removable tape sleeve was placed around the animal's paw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time spent attending to this stimulus (tas) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite 3 days of pre-training, animals undergoing baseline CST still exhibited marked variability in pre-operative baseline test performance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">trs</z:e> range 1-60s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, animals undergoing MST for the first time demonstrated nearly uniformly excellent performance (% tas range 91.5-98.5% of the 30s testing period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although, affected (left) limb performance on both CST (6.8-fold increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">trs</z:e> on POD 1 compared to baseline) and MST (100% decrease in tas on POD 1 compared to baseline) was markedly altered by rMCAo, CST performance declined bilaterally, and no significant differences in the ratio of affected (left) and unaffected (right) limb performance between sham-operated and rMCAo animals were observed at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ratio of left to right performance on the MST was significantly different at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we present a simple modification of the widely used Adhesive Removal test and provide evidence that this test can accurately assess neurological dysfunction in rodents, not only with minimal pre-training, but also with improved localization of the side of injury </plain></SENT>
