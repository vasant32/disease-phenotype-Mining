<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), however, the neuropathological relationship between these two disorders is largely unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that axonopathy, mainly manifesting as impairment of axonal transport and swelling of the axon and varicosity, is a prominent feature in AD and may play an important role in the neuropathological mechanisms in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the early and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes of the axons of neurons in the different brain areas (cortex, hippocampus and striatum) using in vivo tracing technique and grading analysis method in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationship between the changes of axons and the expression of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and hyperphosphorylated Tau, which have been considered as the key neuropathological processes of AD, was analyzed by combining tracing technique with immunohistochemistry or western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we found that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion produced obvious swelling of the axons and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e>, from 6 hours after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion even up to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could not observe Aβ plaques or overexpression of Aβ42 in the ischemic brain areas, however, the site-specific hyperphosphorylated Tau could be detected in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion induce early and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> axonal changes, which may be an important mechanism affecting the clinical outcome and possibly contributing to the development of AD after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
