<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show that a single injection of P4 (4 mg/kg) at 1 h or 48 h, but not 96 h, before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) produces significant protective effects against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the deficits in spatial cognition and LTP induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection exerted by P4 administration at 1 h and 48 h pre-MCAO, termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed P4-neuroprotection, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacology suggested that P4-receptor (P4R) cascading to a Src-ERK1/2 signaling mediated the delayed P4-neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To support this, it was observed by anti-phosph-ERK1/2 immunoblots that a single injection of P4 triggered a P4R-mediated persistent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and their nuclear translocation for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> P4-neuroprotection did not depend on the P4R-mediated Src-ERK1/2 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> P4-administration attenuated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced rise in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that may be a primary cause for MCAO-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect seemed to be exerted by an antagonism of sigma(1) receptor since the sigma(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> NE100 perfectly mimicked the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> P4-neuroprotection and also attenuated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the P4 neuroprotection involves two independent processes depending on the timing of P4 administration before MCAO: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> protection by antagonizing sigma(1) receptor to inhibit NMDAr-Ca(2+) influx and a delayed one by an activation of P4R-mediated Src-ERK signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
