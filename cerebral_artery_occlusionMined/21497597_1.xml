<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of a single i.v. treatment with four increasing doses of pravastatin on permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAo) in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pravastatin was given 10 min after MCAo and its effect was determined 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment results were evaluated in terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, homolateral hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, glial fibrillary acid (GFAP), vimentin (Vim) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) immunoreactivity and TUNEL positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral levels of eNOS were measured by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pravastatin did not reduce cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> while it mitigated homolateral hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences among groups were found regarding GFAP and Vim immunoreactivity and TUNEL positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, pravastatin-treated animals presented a more marked cerebral eNOS immunoreactivity as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In agreement with immunohistochemistry, immunoblot revealed dose-dependent increases in cerebral levels of eNOS in pravastatin rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pravastatin administration reduced cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> by upregulating eNOS expression/activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This, by increasing vascular NO bioavailability, could have produced proximal vasodilation and contributed to reducing perfusional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is worthy stressing how important the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> action is that pravastatin seems to exert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Indeed, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, when widespread and beyond limits of physiological compensation, causes endocranic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and additional cerebral damage over time </plain></SENT>
