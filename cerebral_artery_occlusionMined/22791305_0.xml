<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we conducted in vivo and ex vivo optical imaging for detecting activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and evaluated the protective effect of intracerebral transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic (Tg) mice on the NVU in tPA-mediated brain damage after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with the tMCAO group, the tMCAO plus BMSC group showed significant reductions of in vivo and ex vivo fluorescent signals for MMPs at 48 hr after tMCAO, with a partial colocalization of BMSC-GFP signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracerebrally transplanted BMSCs ameliorated MMP-9 activation by immunohistochemistry and Western blot with differentiation into microglial and astroglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence study revealed improved NVU disruption in the tMCAO plus BMSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that intracerebral BMSC transplantation reduced MMP activation and subsequent NVU disruption caused by tPA after tMCAO and that this MMP activation and BMSC effect were detectable with in vivo and ex vivo optical imaging </plain></SENT>
