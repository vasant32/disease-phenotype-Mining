<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although such <z:mp ids='MP_0000948'>nonconvulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may exacerbate neuropathological processes, they have received limited attention clinically and experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> episodes following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat as a model for brain injury-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical EEG activity was recorded continuously from both hemispheres up to 72 h following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> discharges appeared in EEG recordings within 1 h of MCAo in 13/16 (81%) animals and consisted predominantly of generalized 1-3 Hz rhythmic spiking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> animals engaged in quiet awake or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor behaviors, but exhibited no motor convulsant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals had a mean of 10.6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> episodes within 2 h, with a mean duration of 60 s per episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On average, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> ceased at 1 h 59 min post-MCAo in permanently occluded animals and did not occur following reperfusion at 2 h in transiently occluded animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) appeared over penumbral regions in the injured hemisphere while intermittent rhythmic delta activity (IRDA) recurred in the contralateral hemisphere with frontoparietal dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PLEDs and IRDA persisted up to 72 h in permanent MCAo animals, and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the former was predictive of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presentation of these EEG waveforms, each with characteristic features replicating those in clinical neurologic populations, validates rat MCAo for study of acutely induced brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and other neurophysiological aspects of brain injury </plain></SENT>
