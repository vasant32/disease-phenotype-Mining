<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the changes and the molecular mechanisms of cerebral vascular damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type-2 diabetic (T2DM) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male db/db T2DM and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and sacrificed 24 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2DM-mice exhibited significantly increased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, brain hemorrhagic rate, mortality and cerebrovascular density, but decreased cerebrovascular diameter, arteriolar density and arterial mural cell numbers in the ischemic brain compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hemorrhagic rate was significantly correlated with the mortality (r = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2DM-mice also exhibited increased blood-brain barrier leakage and concomitantly, increased Angiopoietin2, but decreased Angiopoietin1, Tie2 and tight junction protein expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin1 gene expression also significantly decreased in the common carotid artery (CCA) in T2DM-mice compared with WT mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further test the effects of T2DM on cerebrovascular damage, we performed in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The capillary-like tube formation of primary cultured mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) significantly increased, but artery cell migration in the primary CCA cultures significantly decreased both in Sham and MCAo T2DM-mice compared with the WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin1 treatment significantly increased artery cell migration in T2DM-CCA after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tie2-FC, a neutralized Tie2 antibody, significantly decreased artery cell migration in WT-CCA after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, decreased Angiopoietin1/Tie2 and increased Angiopoietin2 expression may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced vascular damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
