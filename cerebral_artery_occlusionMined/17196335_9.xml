<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> modulates the anti-apoptotic signal through the activation of Raf-MEK-ERK and its downstream targets, including 90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were ovariectomied and treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24h after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the positive cells of TUNEL staining in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> prevents the injury-induced decrease of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, it inhibits the injury-induced decrease of p90RSK and Bad phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, the interaction of phospho-Bad and 14-3-3 increased, compared with that of oil-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to brain injury and that Raf-MEK-ERK cascade activation and its downstream targets, p90RSK, Bad phosphorylation by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> mediated these protective effects </plain></SENT>
