<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine (1 microgram/kg/min, IV, 30 min) administered immediately after 3 hr of transient unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion significantly attenuated the post-ischaemic increase of tissue water content, partly 45Ca accumulation in the parietotemporal and frontal cortices ipsilateral to the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion 3 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine decreased the mortality rate at 6 and 9 hr time points after recirculation, although the survival rate at the 24 hr point after recirculation was not different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nimodipine has beneficial effects in the early phase of reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
