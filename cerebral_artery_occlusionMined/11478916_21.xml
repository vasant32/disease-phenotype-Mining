<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motor performance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined in the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for eNOS, nNOS and neurofilament were performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was determined by in-situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PMCAO caused a reproducible cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with motor deficits in the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunohistochemical stainings indicated that eNOS and nNOS were induced in ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most stained neurons were positive for both NOS forms but some reacted with only one NOS antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>nNOS expression peaked at 24-48 h after PMCAO, stained mainly the cytoplasm of core neurons, and disappeared after the 3rd day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>eNOS expression increased until the 7th day, stained mainly the cytoplasm and membrane of penumbral cells and disappeared by the 14th day after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF expression was significantly induced in the penumbral zone in a similar distribution to eNOS </plain></SENT>
