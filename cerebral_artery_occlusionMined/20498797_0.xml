<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether ischemic postconditioning can alter expression of heat shock protein 70 and reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase neuronal injury in rats subjected to transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 min in twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomized into control group and an ischemic postconditioning group (10 rats per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals of control group had no intervention either before or after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic postconditioning was elicited by 3 cycles of 30 s reperfusion interspersed by 10 s <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratios, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> ratios and motor behavior deficits were analyzed 24 hrs after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 reactive cells and cells showing heat shock protein 70 activity were counted in the caudoputamen and frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic postconditiong did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> ratios compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic scores were not significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of caspase-3 reactive cells in the ischemic postconditioning group was not significantly different than the value of the control group in the caudoputamen and frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of cells showing heat shock protein 70 activity was not significantly different than the control group, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ischemic postconditioning may not influence the early brain damage induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
