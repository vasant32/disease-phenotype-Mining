<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi> toxicity has only been demonstrated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WD|WND">Wilson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now hypothesize that inhibition of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dehydrogenases might also contribute to many other injuries and disorders that are reactive oxygen species-mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have modeled reactive oxygen species-mediated injuries using inducers of reactive oxygen species such as <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4876">ethacrynic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28869">menadione</z:chebi>, or another redox active metal (Cd(2+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrated that these toxic exposures were accompanied by an early marked reduction in both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase activities, followed by a decrease in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential and ATP, prior to murine cortical neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">Thiamine</z:chebi> (6 mM), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18047">dihydrolipoic acid</z:chebi> (50 microM), required cofactors for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18290">thiamine pyrophosphate</z:chebi>), attenuated the reactive oxygen species-induced reductions in these enzyme activities, as well as subsequent loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential and ATP, and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We next tested the effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> supplementation on an in vivo model of reactive oxygen species-mediated injury, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral or i.p. <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> administration reduced the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that reactive oxygen species-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be caused in part by reactive oxygen species-mediated inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase in vitro and in vivo, and that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18047">dihydrolipoic acid</z:chebi> may constitute potential therapeutic agents not just against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi> neurotoxicity, but may reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in the broader range of diseases mediated by free radical stress </plain></SENT>
