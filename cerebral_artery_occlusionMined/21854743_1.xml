<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A3 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor (A3AR) is recognized as a novel therapeutic target for ischemic injury; however, the mechanism underlying anti-ischemic protection by the A3AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that 2-chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarbamoyl-4'-thioadenosine (LJ529), a selective A3AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> that may contribute to ischemic cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postischemic treatment with LJ529 markedly reduced cerebral ischemic injury caused by 1.5-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 24-hour reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was abolished by the simultaneous administration of the A3AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MRS1523, but not the A2AAR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SCH58261 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LJ529 prevented the infiltration/migration of microglia and monocytes occurring after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion, and also after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharides</z:chebi> into the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduced migration of microglia by LJ529 could be related with direct inhibition of chemotaxis and down-regulation of spatiotemporal expression of Rho GTPases (including Rac, Cdc42, and Rho), rather than by biologically relevant inhibition of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release (eg, IL-1β, TNF-α, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) or by direct inhibition of excitotoxicity/<z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (not affected by LJ529) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present findings indicate that postischemic activation of A3AR and the resultant reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> should provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
