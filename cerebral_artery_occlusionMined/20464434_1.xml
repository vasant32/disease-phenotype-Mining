<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A bursting cascade of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> imposes progressive neurological deterioration after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (6-mp) has been successful in alleviating cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in a rodent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to examine the effect of 6-mp on cytokine levels in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rodent pMCAO model was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dose of 2 mg/kg 6-mp or vehicle (0.1 mol/L PBS) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min after the induction of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological score, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined 48 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was significantly decreased in animals treated with 6-mp (74.3%, p &lt; 0.01), and the ratio of tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was also decreased in 6-mp-treated groups (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving 6-mp thus showed a significant decrease in IL-1 and TNF-alpha (18/43% and 48/64% in CSF/serum, respectively) when compared with the pMCAO groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that 6-mp interposes the production of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in CSF and serum, attenuates ischemic brain injury, and thus alleviates neurological deficits in the pMCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings also offer first evidence that 6-mp may attenuate TNF-alpha-related neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and also support the notion that 6-mp and other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> could potentially have therapeutic uses in cases of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
