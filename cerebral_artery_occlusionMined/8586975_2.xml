<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Levemopamil, a novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> with antagonistic action on <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> S2-receptors has been reported to be a promising compound for therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This data has been obtained in the rat only, and it is of interest to determine if these beneficial effects are present in other models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was therefore designed to examine its effect on histological outcome and changes in EEG after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by a reversible 1 hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six hours after the induction of the insult, the brain was perfusion-fixed and evaluated for histological damage by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 animals an intravenous infusion of levemopamil was initiated 5 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at a rate of 4 mg/kg/h for 15 min and then at 0.6 mg/kg/h until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control group (n = 7) received a similar infusion of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEG amplitude did not differ between the two groups at any point of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area of ischemic damage in the sections obtained for histological examination at 1-mm intervals, as well as the total volume of ischemic damage for both groups (treated: 1.33 cm3; untreated: 0.97 cm3) also did not show any significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that postischemic treatment with levemopamil at this dose, and in this model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, does not attenuate the ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
