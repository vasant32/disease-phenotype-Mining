<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies were undertaken in Long Evans rats to examine the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral sectioning of vasodilating nerve fibers (parasympathetic and/or sensory) innervating the circle of Willis increases infarction volume following unilateral branch occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) combined with temporary (45 min) bilateral common carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was measured 24 h after surgical occlusion from seven coronal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume (mean +/- SD) in sham animals (group A) and surgically naive animals (group B) measured 153 +/- 43 and 131 +/- 38 mm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After lesions of both sensory (nasociliary nerve) and parasympathetic efferents at the ethmoidal foramen (group C, combined lesion) or selective lesions of parasympathetic efferents (group D), infarction volume increased [214 +/- 47 mm3 (p less than 0.01) and 209 +/- 46 mm3 (p less than 0.05), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No increases were detected after cutting the nasociliary nerve alone (group E) or occluding the external ethmoidal artery (group F) [145 +/- 39 mm3 (p greater than 0.05) and 124 +/- 63 mm3 (p greater than 0.05), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was predominantly located within cortical gray matter and became enlarged on its superior and inferior aspects after parasympathectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were noted whether animals breathed spontaneously (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above) or were artificially respired or whether animals were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine or chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies suggest a previously unrecognized protective role for autonomic parasympathetic fibers in the pathophysiology of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that is not shared by sensory fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The importance of autonomic vasodilating fibers to blood flow in ischemic brain merits further study </plain></SENT>
