<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of Auricularia Auricular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> (APP) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral injury induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats and its underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male SD rats were intragastrically pretreated with AAP at a low (50 mg/kg) or high (100 mg/kg) dose once a day for 20 days before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats intraperitonealy injected with ginkgo biloba extract (EGb671) were taken as positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was achieved by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on the right side for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hrs of reperfusion, the nerve function defects were recorded by Longa's score and the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes were measured by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazoliumchlor (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic neurons were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining after 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was determined via the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AAP treatment decreased Longa's score, brain infart size, apoptotic neurons and mitochondria-generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AAP at 100 mg/kg gave a better performance compared with EGb671 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AAP treatment protected rat brain from focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury by its anti-oxidative effect and worked better than EGb671 </plain></SENT>
