<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported two patients who developed an impairment of reaching movement with their right hand due to left posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed abnormalities in reaching their own body parts with eyes closed, and in reaching objects presented before them with eyes fixed on the objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> was noted in either patient; nor was there any disturbance of the superficial or deep sensation except for a slight disturbance of articular localization of the right upper limb in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The failure for these patients to reach their own body parts with eyes closed was thought to be caused by an impairment of kinesthesia of the right upper limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The failure to reach objects with eyes fixed on them was also likely to be explained by the disturbance of kinesthesia besides the same mechanism as ataxie optique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed low density areas in the medial side of the left temporal and occipital lobes and left lateral pulvinar in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with anatomical and physiological findings in recent years, suggest that nerve fibers related to kinesthesia may be projected on the parietal association area via the lateral pulvinar </plain></SENT>
