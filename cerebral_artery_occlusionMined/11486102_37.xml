<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their role in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in vivo remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to determine the temporal profile of MMP expression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and to investigate its relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, location of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial MMP-2 and MMP-9 determinations were made in 39 patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that involved the middle cerebral artery territory by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples, transcranial Doppler recordings, and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were obtained at baseline and at 12, 24, and 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured with CT scanning at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No correlation was found between MMP-2 and NIHSS score at any time point, although a close relation appeared between mean MMP-9 and final NIHSS score (r=0.486, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 value was the only factor associated with the final NIHSS score in the multiple logistic regression model (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.5 to 13.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A cut-point of MMP-9 142.18 ng/mL had a positive predictive value of 94.4% to assess a patient's NIHSS (&lt;8 or &gt;/=8) by the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were significantly lower when recanalization occurred (528+/-144.3 versus 681.4+/-239.2 ng/mL, P=0.031 for MMP-2; 110.2+/-100.9 versus 244.8+/-130 ng/mL, P=0.004 for MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between mean MMP-9 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r=0.385, P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MMPs are involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 levels are associated with neurological deficit, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
