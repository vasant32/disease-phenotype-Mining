<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong efforts are currently being made to identify drugs that accumulate more efficaciously in ischaemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCC1, which is expressed on the abluminal surface of the brain capillary endothelium and mildly downregulated in response to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, induced by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In biodistribution studies we show that ABCC1 promotes the accumulation of known neuroprotective and neurotoxic compounds in the ischaemic and non-ischaemic brain, ABCC1 deactivation reducing tissue concentrations by up to two orders of magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As such, ABCC1's expression and functionality in the brain differs from the liver, spleen and testis, where ABCC1 is strongly expressed on parenchymal cells, resulting -- in case of liver and testis -- in directed transport from the tissue into the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, ABCC1 deactivation abolished the efficacy of both neuroprotective and neurotoxic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that ABCC1 acts as gateway for pharmacological compounds to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the tailoring of compounds binding to abluminal but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> ABC transporters may facilitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
