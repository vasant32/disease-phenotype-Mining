<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel protease with strong thrombolytic activity, Neanthes japonica (Iznka) fibrinolytic enzyme (NJF) discovered in our laboratory has been reported with characteristics of direct hydrolyzing fibrin and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of NJF and urokinase (UK) was tested in rat models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model was successfully produced by introducing an intraluminal suture into the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NJF (0.25, 0.5, 1mg/kg) was injected intravenously 1h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle group, MCAO animals treated with NJF showed dose dependent reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was reduced in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NJF at 0.5mg/kg was almost equivalent to UK at 15,000U/kg dosage in the reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biomedical assay showed that NJF treatment suppressed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and restored <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activities in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NJF posses neuroprotective potential in rat MCAO and reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection shown by NJF may be attributed to inhibition of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, increase in endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense enzymes </plain></SENT>
