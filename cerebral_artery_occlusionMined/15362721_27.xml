<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the platelet-leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions induced in the cerebral microvasculature by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)/reperfusion, and (2) define the molecular determinants of the prothrombogenic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in this model of focal I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced for 1 hour in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice, WT mice treated with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to either P-selectin or GPIIb/IIIa, and in P-selectin-/-(P-sel-/-) chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated platelets labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CFDASE) were administered intravenously and observed with intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes were observed after intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">rhodamine 6G</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour of MCAO followed by 1 hour of reperfusion resulted in the rolling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes in venules, and after 4 hours of reperfusion, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of both leukocytes and platelets was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although both the P-selectin and GPIIb/IIIa mAbs significantly reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes and platelets at 4 hours of reperfusion, the antiadhesive effects of the P-selectin mAb were much greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The leukocyte and platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> responses were significantly attenuated in both P-sel-/- --&gt; WT and WT --&gt; P-sel-/- bone marrow chimeras, compared with WT --&gt; WT chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo>, induced by antineutrophil serum treatment, also reduced the recruitment of leukocytes and platelets after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate a major role for both platelet-associated and endothelial cell-associated P-selectin, as well as neutrophils in the inflammatory and prothrombogenic responses in the microcirculation after focal cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
