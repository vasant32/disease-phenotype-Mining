<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, investigated the effect of Oxycyte, a second-generation perfluorocarbon solution, on the extent of early ischemic brain damage in a model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight hours of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats by unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) thread occlusion under the control of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were assigned to one of the following treatment groups: nO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and hO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (0.9%, 1 ml/100 g i.v.) and nO2-Oxycyte and hO2-Oxycyte-Oxycyte (1 ml/100 g i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> or Oxycyte was performed immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After injection, breathing was changed to pure oxygen in groups hO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and hO2-Oxycyte while animals in groups nO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and nO2-Oxycyte were allowed to breathe air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The necrotic volume was calculated from serial coronal sections stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32130">silver-nitrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, nitrotyrosine production was studied by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, animals showed a reduction of cerebral blood flow of approximately 80% of the LDF signal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were not affected by the infusion of Oxycyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced in hO2-Oxycyte animals [group nO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>: 341+/-31 mm3 (mean+/-SD), group hO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>: 351+/-33 mm3, group nO2-Oxycyte: 354+/-24 mm3, and group hO2-Oxycyte: 300+/-29 mm3, p &lt; 0.05 versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hO2-Oxycyte animals showed lesser intensity of nitrotyrosine staining when compared with hO2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These results suggest that Oxycyte administered immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> may exert neuroprotective effects in the early phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
