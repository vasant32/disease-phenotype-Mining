<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> causes myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may cause myocardial damage as a consequence of elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, experiments were done in 23 chloralosed, paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats to investigate the effects of occluding (n = 17) or sham-occluding (n = 6) the left middle cerebral artery on the myocardium and on circulating levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 12-22 hr, 41% (7/17) of the hearts had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> (3/7), focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (3/7), or both (1/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage the levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> were significantly increased compared to pre- middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> values (+46 +/- 18% and +142 +/- 45%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As well, in cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage, changes from initial levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> were significantly increased over those of experimental cats without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals which did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage (10/17) the circulating plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> were not significantly different from pre-occlusion values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, sham occlusion did not alter plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that a percentage of animals subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> have myocardial damage and an increase in plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels, due to increased sympathetic activity after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, may cause myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
