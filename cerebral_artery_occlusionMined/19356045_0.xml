<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the role of various drug transporters in the brain penetration of TSB using several in vitro and in vivo mouse and rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The uptake and efflux of TSB in rat primary microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVECs) were ATP-dependent and significantly altered in the presence of a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) or multidrug resistance associated protein (Mrp1/2) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A polarized transport of TSB was found in RBMVEC monolayers with facilitated efflux from the abluminal to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of a P-gp inhibitor (e.g. <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>) in both abluminal and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> sides attenuated the polarized transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an in situ rat brain perfusion model, TSB crossed the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at a greater rate than that for <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, and the brain penetration was increased in the presence of a P-gp or Mrp1/2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain levels of TSB were only about 30% of that in the plasma and it could be increased to up to 72% of plasma levels when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, or probenecid was co-administered in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The entry of TSB to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> increased by 67-97% in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or treatment with the neurotoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi>, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, The brain levels of TSB in mdr1a(-/-) and mrp1(-/-) mice were 28- to 2.6-fold higher than those in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TSB has limited brain penetration through the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> due to the contribution of P-gp and to a lesser extent of Mrp1 in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm whether these corresponding transporters in humans are involved in limiting the penetration of TSB across the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and the clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
