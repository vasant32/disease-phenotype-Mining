<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to demonstrate the antagonistic effects of ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (ULMWH) on cerebral ischemic injury in rats and the mechanisms underlying the effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h followed by reperfusion for 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ULMWH (0.5, 1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was administered after the MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the reperfusion, neurological deficit scores, body weight and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spectrophotometric assay was used to determine the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that vein injection of ULMWH at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg(-1) exerted significant neuroprotective effects on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury via significantly decreasing neurological deficit scores, increasing body weight, reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, ULMWH significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, and increased SOD activity in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, ULMWH decreased the intracellular calcium concentration remarkably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings suggest that ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> might act as a neuroprotective agent useful in the treatment in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
