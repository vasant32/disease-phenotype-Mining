<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, administrations of L-NNA (1 mg/kg, i.p.) to each animal were done at the time of 5 min, 3, 6 and 24 h after MCAo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown from this study that L-NNA significantly mitigated ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, and histological examinations revealed that this compound markedly reduced infarction size that occurred following MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that NO formation is at least partly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
