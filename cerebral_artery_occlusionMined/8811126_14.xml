<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This event has been attributed to changes in the collateral vessels supplying the territory of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since only a limited amount of data is available about the plasticity of the microvascular system after a cortical ischemic lesion, in the present study we have evaluated whether the restoration of blood flow to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the territory of the middle cerebral artery after permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is due only to flow through preexisting collateral vessels or also to the development of new microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in 45 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, magnetic resonance imaging was used to select 16 rats with cortical lesions of similar size and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks, vascular corrosion casts were obtained from 8 rats by injection of low-viscosity resin and observed by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlative light and electron microscopy study was performed using the remaining 8 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two different patterns of vascular modifications were found, one dorsal and one ventral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dorsal portion of the lesion was vascularized by collateral arteries originating from the anterior or posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collateral trunks showed a meandering course, mainly in the occipital pole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the ventral portion of the lesion a complex microvascular system was found characterized by an intense vascular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The arterioles showed a parallel, candelabrum-like pattern with dichotomic branching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contraction rings were frequently seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The capillaries showed a sinusoid-like structure, with a large lumen and a continuous endothelium with many micropinocytotic vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A peripheral ring-shaped venous sinus was composed of a network of flat vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results give the first comprehensive description of the microvascular modifications in a focal model of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and suggest that the restoration of blood flow to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels described in the territory of the middle cerebral artery after permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be due not only to flow through collateral vessels but also to the development of a new vascular system originating mainly from branches of the middle cerebral artery before the occlusion point </plain></SENT>
