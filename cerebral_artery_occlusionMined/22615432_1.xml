<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male, 8- to 12-week old PHD1−/−, PHD2+/− and PHD3−/− mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermate were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the experiments, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behaviour was assessed at both 2 h and 24 h after reperfusion with a common neuroscore </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared to their WT littermates, PHD2+/− mice had significantly increased cerebral microvascular density and more effective restoration of CBF upon reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PHD2+/− mice showed significantly better functional outcomes and higher activity rates at both 2 h and 24 h after MCAO, associated with significant fewer apoptotic cells in the penumbra and less <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption; PHD3−/− mice had impaired rCBF upon early reperfusion but comparable functional outcomes; PHD1−/− mice did not show any significant changes following the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Production of ROS, HIF1α staining and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content in the brain were not different in any comparison </plain></SENT>
