<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed the impact of ET-1 on perfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a focal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by use of the selective ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> Ro 61-1790 (affinity for ET(A) receptor 1000 fold greater than ETB receptor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) showed extensive reductions in microvascular perfusion 4 h post-MCAO that were significantly attenuated by Ro 61-1790 pretreatment (10 mg/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ro 61-1790 concomitantly and significantly reduced the ischemic lesion volume in the same animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was maintained 24 h post-MCAO providing that the animals received additional i.v. injections of 5 mg/kg Ro 61-1790 at 5 h and 8 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that ET(A) receptor antagonism partially preserves tissue perfusion following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that this effect is associated with significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also support the hypothesis that vasoactive mediators, and ET-1 in particular, are important contributors to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
