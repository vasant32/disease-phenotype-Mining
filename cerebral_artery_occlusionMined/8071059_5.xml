<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PMNs are believed to play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and C5a uptake is an important functional indicator for G protein-coupled receptor trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of PMNs to internalize 125I-labeled C5a in vitro is an index of the functional state of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of model preparation and focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O/R) on internalization of C5a by PMNs isolated from baboons (Papio anubis/cynocephalus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar assays were performed on PMNs isolated before and after exposing the animals undergoing <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O/R to an anti-inflammatory 21-aminosteroid, tirilazad mesylate (U74006F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical implantation of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion device had no measureable effect on uptake of C5a to the cytosol by the PMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O/R appeared to decrease uptake of C5a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both in vivo and in vitro administration of tirilazad, to otherwise untreated animals and to isolated cells, respectively, reduced baseline values of C5a uptake in the PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic uptake of C5a was also reduced in PMNs isolated from subjects that had undergone <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O/R and tirilazad treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, with or without exposure to tirilazad mesylate, may inhibit internalization of C5a by the PMN receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the ability of C5a to gain entry into the PMN may result from receptor down-regulation or "desensitization" of the cell, possibly due to activation of complement and generation of C5a which occupied the receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the effect of tirilazad presumably results from the ability of this drug to enter the membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> layer and reduce fluidity </plain></SENT>
