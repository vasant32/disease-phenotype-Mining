<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although periostin, an extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, plays pivotal roles in survival, migration, and regeneration in various cells, its expression and function in the brain are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the expression and role of periostin in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of full-length periostin (periostin 1 [Pn1]) and its splicing variant lacking exon 17 (periostin 2 [Pn2]) was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining in male C57BL6/J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The actions of periostin were examined in adult primary neuronal culture and in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of Pn2, but not of Pn1, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was markedly changed after tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was decreased in the ischemic core at 3 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, Pn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased in both the peri-ischemic and ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periostin was mainly observed in neurons in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, neuronal expression of periostin was decreased temporarily in the ischemic region, but increased in astrocytes and around endothelial cells at 24 hours after tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of importance, intracerebroventricular injection of Pn2 resulted in a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 hours after tMCAo associated with phosphorylation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, the Pn2-treated mice survived longer until 1 week after tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pn2 significantly inhibited neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and stimulated neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated that periostin was expressed in the brain, and exogenous Pn2 exhibited neuroprotective effects and accelerated neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional studies on periostin may provide new insights into the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
