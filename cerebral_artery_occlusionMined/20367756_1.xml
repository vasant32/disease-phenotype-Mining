<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression of VGLUT1-3 in the cortex and caudate-putamen of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed an increase of VGLUT1 signal in cortex and caudate-putamen until 3 days of reperfusion followed by a reduction 7 days after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, VGLUT2 and 3 were drastically reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy revealed an increase in VGLUT2 and 3 immunolabelling in the reactive astrocytes of the ischemic corpus callosum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in VGLUTs and EAATs expression were differently correlated to neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, changes in VGLUT1 and EAAT2 expression showed a significant positive correlation in caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest a contribution of VGLUTs to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in these structures, which could promote neuroblast migration and neurogenesis during ischemic recovery, and a possible interplay with EAATs in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels, at least in the first stages of ischemic recovery </plain></SENT>
