<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption occurs early enough to be within the thrombolytic time window, and this early ischemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage is closely associated with hemorrhagic transformation and thus emerging as a promising target for reducing the hemorrhagic complications of thrombolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying early ischemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the early molecular events of ischemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage using in vitro oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and in vivo rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of bEND3 monolayer to OGD for 2 h significantly increased its permeability to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and promoted the secretion of metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2/9) and cytosolic translocation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This same OGD treatment also led to rapid degradation of tight junction protein occludin and dissociation of claudin-5 from the cytoskeleton, which contributed to OGD-induced endothelial barrier disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using selective MMP-2/9 inhibitor SB-3CT (2-[[(4-phenoxyphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29825">sulfonyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30977">thiirane</z:chebi>) or their neutralizing antibodies or Cav-1 siRNA, we found that MMP-2 was the major enzyme mediating OGD-induced occludin degradation, while Cav-1 was responsible for claudin-5 redistribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction between Cav-1 and claudin-5 was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these in vitro findings, we observed fluorescence tracer extravasation, increased gelatinolytic activity, and elevated interstitial MMP-2 levels in ischemic subcortical tissue after 2 h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, occludin protein loss and claudin-5 redistribution were detected in ischemic cerebromicrovessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> initiates two rapid parallel processes, MMP-2-mediated occludin degradation and Cav-1-mediated claudin-5 redistribution, to cause <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption at early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stages relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
