<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of an <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> by using mechanical thrombectomy after IVT failure were assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion within 4.5 hours with an NIHSS score between 8 and 25 and a DWI ASPECTS of &gt;5 were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From September 2009 to September 2010, mechanical thrombectomy by using the Solitaire FR device was systematically performed if no clinical improvement was observed 1 hour after the initiation of IVT (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results in terms of clinical outcome were compared with those from an IVT series from January 2007 to August 2009 (IVT group).RESULTS:Alteplase was administered in 123 patients with proximal intracranial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six had a confirmed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion: 32 were included in the IVT group; and 24, in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, the median NIHSS improvement was 8.5 points in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> group (25%-75% CI, 1.5-13) and 3 points in the IVT group (25%-75% CI, 1-5) (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 17/22 (77%) patients from the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> group and 15/30 (50%) from the IVT group had an mRS score of â‰¤2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding variables, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> was strongly associated with favorable clinical outcome (77% versus 50%; adjusted odds ratio = 11.9; 95% CI, 1.6-89.1; P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was observed.CONCLUSIONS:<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> by using systematic mechanical thrombectomy after IVT failure safely improves the clinical outcome at 3 months and could represent an interesting alternative in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
