<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, which involves permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery of the rat with 4 h survival, was used to find the minimum effective plasma concentration of dizocilpine (MK-801) and to determine its dose-effect relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK-801 was administered at the time of occlusion and was given as an i.v. bolus followed by an infusion for 4 h to maintain a steady state plasma concentration of the drug throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK-801 was given at 3 dose levels; 0.04 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus + 0.6 micrograms kg-1 min-1 infusion; 0.12 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus + 1.8 micrograms kg-1 min-1 infusion; 0.4 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus + 6 micrograms kg-1 min-1 infusion, which gave mean plasma levels over the 4 h of 8.0 ng ml-1, 18.9 ng ml-1 and 113.2 ng ml-1 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MK-801 at 8.0 ng ml-1 gave 10% reduction in the volume of ischaemic brain damage in the cerebral cortex which just reached significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The middle dose of MK-801 (18.9 ng ml-1) gave a highly significant reduction in the volume of ischaemic brain damage in the cerebral cortex and hemisphere, volumes of ischaemic tissue being reduced by 60% and 50% compared to saline-treated animals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest plasma concentration of MK-801 (113.2 ng ml-1) resulted in a 35% reduction in the volume of hemispheric damage and a 40% reduction in the volume of cortical damage, which were significant.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the amount of protection afforded by the highest dose of MK-801 may be due to the hypotensive effect of this dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no protection against the volume of damage in the caudate nucleus for any of the doses of MK-801 tested.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore the minimum effective plasma concentration of MK-801 was 8.0 ngml1, although the greatest protection was seen with a plasma level of 18.9 ng ml- 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This correlates well with the concentration of MK-801 required to block <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptors and prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor mediated neurotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
