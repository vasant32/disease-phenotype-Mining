<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Mimusops elengi (ME) against cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were pretreated with ME (100 and 200mg/kg) for seven days and focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 60min of MCAO and 24h of reperfusion, a battery of behavioral tests assessed the extent of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were measured in TTC stained brain sections and the extent of blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption was observed by Evan's blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxidative and nitrative stress parameters were estimated in the brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, simultaneous quantification of five polyphenolic biomarkers were done using HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with ME at doses of 100 and 200mg/kg significantly improved the neurobehavioral alterations and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and extent of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also prevented the alteration in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status and reduced the <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels when compared to ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, HPLC studies revealed that ME contains five bioactive polyphenolic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly indicate the neuroprotective effect of ME against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> like injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observed protective effect might be attributed to the polyphenolic compounds and their <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory property </plain></SENT>
