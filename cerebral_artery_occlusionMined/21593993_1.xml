<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In humans and in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, collateral blood flow between territories of the major pial arteries has a profound impact on cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a gap in our understanding of the genetic determinants of collateral formation and flow, as well as the signaling pathways and neurovascular interactions regulating this flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that collateral flow between branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) can protect mouse cortex from infarction after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the number and diameter of collaterals varies among mouse strains and after transgenic manipulations, a combination of methods is required to control for these variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report an inexpensive approach to characterizing the cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, and in vivo monitoring of cerebral blood flow as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we introduce a new, minimally invasive method for the occlusion of distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These methods will permit a new generation of studies on the mechanisms regulating collateral remodeling and cortical blood flow after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
