<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury was induced by a 2-hour left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using an intraluminal filament, followed by 46hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CGRP (1 microg/ml) at the dose of 3 microg/kg, i.p., was administered at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Saline (3 ml/kg body weight) treated animals were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals were also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 48 hours after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, histological alterations, based fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that CGRP could significantly decrease <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improve brain tissue histological damage, promote bFGF expression and inhibit AQP4 expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the neuroprotective effects of CGRP may be mediated by promoting bFGF expression and inhibiting AQP4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The spatial and temporal distribution of molecules involved in the ischemic cascade by CGRP administration should be further studied </plain></SENT>
