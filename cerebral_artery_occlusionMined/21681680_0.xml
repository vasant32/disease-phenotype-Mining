<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its structural homology to the endothelial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, NT-1 may have similar effects on vascular network formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NT-1 was shown to be able to stimulate the proliferation and migration of human cerebral endothelial cells in vitro and also promote focal neovascularization in adult brain in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we reported the delivery of NT-1 using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (AAV-NT-1) into mouse brain followed by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that AAV vectors did not elicit a detectable <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, cell loss or neuronal damage after brain transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of NT-1 was increased in the AAV-NT-1-transduced tMCAO mice compared with the control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the neurobehavioral outcomes were significantly improved in AAV-NT-1-transduced mice compared with the control animals (P&lt;0.05) 7 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that NT-1 plays a neuronal function recovery role in ischemic brain and that NT-1 gene transfer might present a valuable approach to treat brain ischemic disorders </plain></SENT>
