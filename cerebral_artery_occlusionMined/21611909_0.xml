<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ginkgolide K, a natural platelet-activating factor receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its neuroprotective effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of ginkgolide K on neuroprotection and the potential mechanisms in the rat I/R model induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were pretreated with ginkgolide K 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg (i.v.) once a day for 5 days before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit score (NDS), brain water content, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and pathology of brain tissue, as well as indexes of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS)] were measured at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that pretreatment with ginkgolide K significantly diminished the volume of infarction and brain water content, and improved NDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ginkgolide K markedly reversed the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, NO, NOS and SOD to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state in serum or cerebral ischemic section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining showed the neuronal injury was significantly improved after being pretreated with ginkgolide K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that ginkgolide K exhibits neuroprotective properties through its antioxidative action in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
