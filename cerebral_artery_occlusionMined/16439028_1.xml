<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, each method has several advantages and drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article describes a simple technique to simultaneously and continuously monitor LDF and ECG over both cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential of this method to improve the reliability of the filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient MCAO under three different experimental conditions (n=10 each group): MCAO in [A] normothermic animals, in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30166">[B]</z:chebi> animals treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29435">[C]</z:chebi> animals receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> for induction of burst suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was continuously recorded bilaterally by LDF and the electrocorticogram was continuously recorded over both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that monitoring of cortical electrophysiological activity by ECG allows detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electrophysiological status and provides continuous control of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> induced burst suppression as well as information about postischemic electrophysiological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECG did not detect MCAO, premature reperfusion, or SAH during burst suppression induced by <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MCAO, SAH and premature reperfusion were rapidly indicated by LDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that simultaneous bilateral LDF and ECG during MCAO are of complementary value, in particular if <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> are investigated </plain></SENT>
