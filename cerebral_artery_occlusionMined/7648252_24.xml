<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We immunohistochemically investigated the induction and localization of a low-molecular weight stress protein, HSP27, in the rat brain following 1 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in comparison with those of HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brains were perfusion-fixed after 4 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections were then prepared and used for immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brains, we observed no immunoreactivities to HSP70 and HSP27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HSP70 was localized predominantly in neurons in areas peripheral to the ischemic center after 1 day and 3 days, and in endothelial cells and perivascular cells within the ischemic center after 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HSP27 was induced in microglia in the ischemic center after 4 h, and then in reactive astrocytes distributed widely in the ipsilateral hemisphere and in part of the contralateral hemisphere after 1 through 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the center of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> where infarction developed, only nonspecific staining was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression patterns of HSP70 and HSP27 were quite different with regard to cell type, distribution, and time course following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HSP70 may be a sensitive marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal stress in the penumbral areas, whereas HSP27, which was most prominently induced in reactive astrocytes in periischemic and remote areas, may be a component of glial reaction to injury </plain></SENT>
