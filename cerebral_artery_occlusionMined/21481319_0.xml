<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the changes of proportion of CD4(+);CD25(+); regulatory T cells (Treg) in Splenocytes and concentration of serum TGF-β1 in diverse period after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(tMCAO) in mice and correlation between Treg and TGF-β1, so as to elucidate their roles in the immunological injury of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 60 male Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups, i.e. sham group (24 h, n=10) and five tMCAO groups(<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 5 d, n=10/group), amount to six groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The models of tMCAO were established by modified monofilament method; Neurologic deficit score was performed at each time point after tMCAO, and then, to sacrifice mice and measure the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by TTC staining; the expression of Foxp3 in spleen was observed by frozen section and immunofluorescence method; the proportions of Treg in splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry(FCM) and the concentrations of serum TGF-β1 were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study observed that there was obvious immunological injury and it was gradually worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, TTC staining indicated that the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> gradually enlarged and peaked at 48 h following reperfusion, subsequently, exhibited slight decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological function gradually improved after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were positive expressions of Foxp3 in the mice spleens and significant different in every groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FCM indicated, compared with sham group, the percentage of Treg was decrease at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (P&lt;0.05), and recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 72 h, and significantly increased at 5 d (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of serum TGF-β1 also showed the similar tendency, the concentration of serum TGF-β1 was lower at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion than sham group, and recovered to sham's level at 48 h, and was significantly higher at 5 d than sham group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, there was a positive correlation between serum level of TGF-β1 and percentage of Treg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The levels of Treg and TGF-β 1 were decrease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, and they were significant increase in the recovery progress, which closely associated with the change of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Imbalance of Treg and TGF-β1 is very likely to play an important role in the immunological injury of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
