<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis showed positive results in this condition, however even when strict criteria are used, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical embolectomy has been described earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed multimodal therapy of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case Report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 49-year-old female patient who-according to the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS)-was rated as 19 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the horizontal segment of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After failed i.v. thrombolysis, only a part of the clot could be evacuated by the endovascular approach-without restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> patency of the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was re-established after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 72 hours, the patient had an NIHSS score of 14, with a small haematoma in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our case multimodal therapy combining i.v. thrombolysis, mechanical disruption of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenting and platelet function <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, resulted in successful recanalization of the acutely occluded left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
