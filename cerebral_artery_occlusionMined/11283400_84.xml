<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) lower serum cholesterol and decrease the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> exert some of their beneficial effects independent of cholesterol lowering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> administration upregulates endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), resulting in more functional protein, augmentation of cerebral blood flow, and neuroprotection in a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we examined whether another member of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> family shared these effects and whether eNOS upregulation is sustained with longer treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mevastatin (2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day) was administered to 18- to 22-g male mice for 7, 14, or 28 days before 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the use of the filament model (n=9 to 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure and gases, relative cerebral blood flow, and blood cholesterol levels were monitored in a subset of animals (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absolute cerebral blood flow was measured by the [(14)C]iodoamphetamine indicator fractionation technique (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mevastatin increased levels of eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and improved neurological deficits in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Greatest protection was seen with 14- and 28-day high-dose treatment (26% and 37% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol levels were reduced only after 28 days of treatment and did not correlate with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline absolute cerebral blood flow was 30% higher after 14-day high-dose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> prophylactic treatment with mevastatin upregulated eNOS and augmented cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These changes occurred in the absence of changes in serum cholesterol levels, were sustained for up to 1 month of treatment, and resulted in neuroprotection after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
