<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rapid occlusion of the middle cerebral artery above the rhinal fissure produces a large ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in hypertensive rats, but this occlusion results in a minimal lesion in young normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to attenuate rising blood pressure in young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with hydralazine before the occlusion to determine if the gross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is smaller, and if it is, to determine whether length, width, depth, or surface area of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> changes, which could suggest a mechanism of protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Untreated rats (n = 6) and rats receiving hydralazine for 1.5 (n = 6) or 5 (n = 5) weeks were anesthetized, and the middle cerebral artery was rapidly occluded with a ligature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day later the rats were killed and the brains were fixed in formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fine-grain-release film that is sensitive to spectral properties of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was used to photograph the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarcted areas were traced on paper and then digitized for measurements and computations with a microcomputer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with untreated rats, tail systolic blood pressure (120 +/- 3 versus 138 +/- 4 mm Hg), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (61 +/- 4 versus 93 +/- 6 mm3), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> surface area (39 +/- 1 versus 54 +/- 2 mm2), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> width (3.8 +/- 0.1 versus 4.8 +/- 0.2 mm), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> length (6.0 +/- 0.3 versus 8.1 +/- 0.3 mm) were less in rats receiving hydralazine for 5 weeks (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No change was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with hydralazine for 5 weeks before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> results in a smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The narrower, shorter dimensions indicate increased protection against lateral enlargement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the possibility that protection was due to increased collateral blood flow through modified blood vessels </plain></SENT>
