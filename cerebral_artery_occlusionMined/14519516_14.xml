<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated CB1 receptor signal transduction by [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43000">GTPgammaS</z:chebi> binding in situ and in vitro to assess changes in receptor functionality after SDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, we continued to investigate the neuroprotective properties of BAY 38-7271 in the rat SDH and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCA-O) model as well as the efficacy with respect to SDH-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43000">GTPgammaS</z:chebi> binding revealed minor attenuation of CB1 receptor functionality on brain membranes from injured hemispheres when compared to non-injured hemispheres or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the rat SDH model, BAY 38-7271 displayed strong neuroprotective efficacy when administered immediately after SDH either as a 1 h (65% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction at 0.1 microg/kg) or short-duration (15 min) infusion (53% at 10 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When administered as a 4 h infusion with a 5 h delay after injury, significant neuroprotection was observed (49% at 1.0 microg/kg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was also observed when BAY 38-7271 was administered as a 5 h delayed 15 min short-duration infusion (64% at 3 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the neuroprotective potential of BAY 38-7271 was demonstrated in the rat tMCA-O model, displaying pronounced neuroprotective efficacy in the cerebral cortex (91% at 1 ng/kg/h) and striatum (53% at 10 ng/kg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BAY 38-7271 also reduced intracranial pressure (28% at 250 ng/kg/h) and brain water content (20% at 250 ng/kg/h) when determined 24 h post-SDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these data it is concluded that the neuroprotective efficacy of BAY 38-7271 is mediated by multiple mechanisms triggered by cannabinoid receptors </plain></SENT>
