<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation offers a potential new treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal studies using models that produce ischemic damage in both the striatum and the frontal cortex have shown beneficial effects when hNT cells (postmitotic immature neurons) were transplanted into the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of hNT cells in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in which the striatum remains intact and damage is restricted to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>hNT cells were transplanted into the ischemic cortex 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells exhibited robust survival at 4 weeks posttransplant even at the lesion border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hNT cells did not migrate, but they did extend long neurites into the surrounding parenchyma mainly through the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurite extension was predominantly toward the lesion in ischemic animals but was bidirectional in uninjured animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extension of neurites through the cortex toward the lesion was also seen when there was some surviving cortical tissue between the graft and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged deficits were obtained in four tests of sensory-motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>hNT-transplanted animals showed a significant improvement in functional recovery on one motor test, but there was no effect on the other three tests relative to control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite clear evidence of graft survival and neurite extension, the functional benefit of hNT cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is not guaranteed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional benefit could depend on other variables, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location, whether the cells mature, the behavioral tests employed, rehabilitation training, or as yet unidentified factors </plain></SENT>
