<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats underwent 24-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was shown with staining and quantitated by image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores were determined with a 0-5 grade scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities of forebrains were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: bFGF (45 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 i.v. for 3 h, started 5 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) showed potent neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarction volumes were decreased from 272 mm3 +/- 22 mm3 (saline-treated) to 201 mm3 +/- 30 mm3 (bFGF-treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores were decreased from 3.6 +/- 1.5 (saline-treated) to 2.3 +/- 1.6 (bFGF-treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced an increase in the activities of catalase (CAT), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-PX), but a decrease in the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> s-transferase (GSH-ST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of bFGF further increased the CAT activity but had no effect on the activities of SOD, GSH-PX, and GSH-ST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: bFGF has a neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The elevation of CAT activity by bFGF may be involved in this effect </plain></SENT>
