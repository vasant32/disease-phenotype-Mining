<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate whether repetitive short episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> would alter the resulting brain injury as compared with a single long period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a rat model for focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion were performed by the intraluminal thread technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental design consisted of a single 90-minute occlusion period in the continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group versus three 30-minute occlusion periods with 15-minute reperfusion periods in the repetitive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the ischemic period, local cerebral blood flow values significantly decreased in both the continuous and the repetitive groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow restoration was demonstrated after each episode of reperfusion in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological status scores 2 hours after surgery in the rats subjected to repetitive insults were significantly better compared with those in the rats of the continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the scores on Days 1, 3, and 7 did not show a significantly better difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed 7 days after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for the measurement of the infarction area under the microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total area of infarction was significantly reduced (4.05 +/- 4.56 versus 47.2 +/- 37.3 mm2, P &lt; 0.001) by interruption of the ischemic time period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
