<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated spontaneous and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both humans and rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a full characterization of these pyretic changes and the effects of anti-pyretic drugs on outcome is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aims of this study were to monitor conscious body temperature (n=10 per group) using programmable microchips for up to 24 h in rats following either permanent (p) or 90 min transient (t) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or sham surgery, and to evaluate the relationship to hypothalamic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the effects of anti-pyretic drug therapy on body temperature and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated in animals treated with vehicle, optimal doses of either aspirin or <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> (250 mg/kg i.p.) following pMCAO (n=10 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1 h, body temperature significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased to 38.6+/-0.2 degrees C following tMCAO and 38.9+/-0.1 degrees C following pMCAO compared with sham-operated animals (37.1+/-0.1 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (&gt; or =38.1 degrees C) was observed for up to 24 h following pMCAO but approached baseline within 30 min (37.6+/-0.2 degrees C) following tMCAO with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> was related to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> where hypothalamic damage was observed in (80%) of the animals undergoing pMCAO and (0%) in the tMCAO group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> (250 mg/kg i.p.) significantly attenuated (P&lt;0.05) but did not normalize core body temperature up to 2 h (38.2+/-0.4 degrees C) compared with vehicle treated animals (39.3+/-0.1 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin had no effect on temperature under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypothalamic damage and lesion volume were not different between animals treated with <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> (253.3+/-8.5 mm(3)), aspirin (264.0+/-11.6 mm(3)) or vehicle (274.4+/-8.2 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate the utility of programmable microchips to monitor serial changes in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sustained post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> and negative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35493">antipyretic</z:chebi> treatment may be attributed to the extensive hypothalamic injury suggesting that better pharmacologic approaches to reduce body temperature should be identified and evaluated for brain protection in severe experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
