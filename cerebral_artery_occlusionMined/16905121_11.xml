<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Injury to axons and oligodendrocytes has been poorly characterized in most animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and hence has been difficult to target therapeutically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is therefore necessary to characterize axonal and oligodendroglial injury in these models, in order to rationally design putative protective compounds that minimize this injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to characterize injury to axons and oligodendrocytes in the endothelin-1 (ET-1) model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in conscious adult male Long Evans rats by the perivascular microinjection of ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative histopathology was performed on forebrain sections at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after ET-1 administration, using ballistic light analyses and immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP), SMI32, and Tau-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ballistic light analyses of cortical and striatal lesions revealed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was maximal in these regions by 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APP and SMI32 immunohistochemistry demonstrated that axonal injury was maximal by 6 h in this model; however, some injured axons appeared to maintain good structural integrity up to 72 h after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Density measurements for Tau-1-immunopositive oligodendrocytes were significantly elevated within the corpus callosum from 48 h, but reductions in total oligodendrocyte numbers were not apparent up 72 h after ET-1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that axonal and oligodendroglial injury should be investigated as potential targets for delayed therapeutic intervention after MCAO </plain></SENT>
