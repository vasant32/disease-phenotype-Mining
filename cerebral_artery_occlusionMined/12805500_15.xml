<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of UK-279,276 (also referred to as recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor), a selective CD11b/CD18 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, in combination with thrombolytic therapy on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=88) were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups (n=11 in each group): vehicle treatment alone at 2 or 4 hours, UK-279,276 treatment alone at 2 or 4 hours, recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rhtPA) treatment alone at 2 or 4 hours, or the combination of UK-279,276 and rhtPA at 2 or 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological function, hemorrhagic transformation, neutrophil accumulation, and parenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> were measured 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with UK-279,276 significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved neurological severity scores, an index of neurological functional deficit, but had no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rhtPA alone at 2 but not 4 hours significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological function compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment with UK-279,276 and rhtPA at 2 or 4 hours significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and enhanced recovery of neurological function compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil accumulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in the brain parenchyma of combination-treated rats at 2 and 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) compared with corresponding vehicle-treated control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of the combined treatments was superior to the additive effects from each treatment of rhtPA or UK-279,276 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the combination treatment with UK-279,276 and rhtPA may extend the window of thrombolytic therapy for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
