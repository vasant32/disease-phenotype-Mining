<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The assessment of the functional outcome - in addition to the conventional endpoints as histomorphometry of the ischemic brain damage - for the evaluation of cerebroprotective therapies is increasingly recommended, although there is little consensus on appropriate procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a battery of sensorimotor tasks in rats after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to select those with the highest potential to discriminate between various degrees of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min of MCAO and assigned to one of four treatment arms: (1) sham-operated controls, (2) vehicle-treated controls, (3) moderately effective neuroprotection by 2x100 mg/kg alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> nitrone (PBN), (4) highly effective neuroprotection by mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were daily quantified using the beam balance task (1.5 cm, 2.5 cm diameter rectangular and 2.5 cm diameter cylindrical beam), the prehensile traction task, the rotarod, and a six-point neuro-score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarction of cerebral cortex and basal ganglia was assessed one week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with PBN significantly reduced cortical infarction (-31%), while treatment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> resulted in a significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of cortex (-94%) and basal ganglia (-27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beam balance, prehensile traction and rotarod failed to demonstrate any difference in motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The six-point neuro-score showed a significant correlation with cortical infarction from day 2 and with total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The smaller the reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, the later the corresponding difference in neuro-score became apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome after MCAO in rats can be assessed by a relatively simple measurement of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The slope of functional recovery is closely related with the degree of the morphological, particularly cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If expected treatment effects are small, an observation period of at least 3 days should be planned for the study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The functional impairment from focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and its subsequent recovery could provide valuable information for future studies evaluating the neuroprotective potential of novel agents and procedures </plain></SENT>
