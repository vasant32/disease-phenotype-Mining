<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury in a novel nonhuman primate (NHP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model by using multiple outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silk sutures were inserted into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery of rhesus macaques to achieve permanent occlusion of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sutures were introduced via the femoral artery by using endovascular microcatheterization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), infarction was detectable by using diffusion-weighted MRI imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> expanded by 24 h after MCAO and then were detectable on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> seen by MRI were consistent with neuronal injury demonstrated histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral function after MCAO was determined by using 2 neurologic testing scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic assessments indicated that impairment after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was limited to motor function in the contralateral arm; other neurologic and behavioral parameters were largely unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also used microarrays to examine gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after MCAO-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several genes were altered in a time-dependent manner after MCAO, suggesting that this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model may be suitable for identifying blood biomarkers associated with the presence and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This NHP <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model likely will facilitate the elucidation of mechanisms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ability to identify candidate blood biomarkers in NHP after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may prompt the development of new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
