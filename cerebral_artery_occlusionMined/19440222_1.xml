<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the effects of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) on the pathophysiological process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, we examined the changes in ERCC1 expression, as well as the functional significance of ERCC1 in the rat brain following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: (1) ERCC1 immunopositive cells were widely distributed in various brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ERCC1 expression was localized to the nuclei of neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) ERCC1 expression, as determined by western blot, increased at 3 days, remaining until 14 days, in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced increased ERCC1 expression within the periinfarct core, with increasingly less expression toward the core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Knockdown of ERCC1 expression by intraventricular injection of antisense plasmids increased DNA damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) ERCC1 overproduction, by injection of expression plasmids, significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the accumulation of DNA-damaged neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that both endogenous ERCC1 and exogenous ERCC1 have an important neuroprotective function in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, administration of ERCC1 to the brain could prove to be a successful strategy for neuronal protection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
