<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim here was to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the detrimental effects of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on mild ischemic brain injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was induced in mice by peripheral interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) challenge and focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> caused an alteration in the kinetics of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption through conversion of a transient to a sustained disruption of the tight junction protein, claudin-5, and also markedly exacerbated disruption to the cerebrovascular basal lamina protein, collagen-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These alterations were associated with a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced increase in neurovascular gelatinolytic activity that was mediated by a fivefold increase in neutrophil-derived matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the brains of IL-1beta-challenged mice after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition of MMP-9 abrogated the effects of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on the sustained but not the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disruption of claudin-5, which was associated with phosphorylation of cerebrovascular myosin light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 inhibition also attenuated the deleterious impact of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on brain damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, neurological deficit, and incidence of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a transformation from transient to sustained <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption caused by enhanced neutrophil-derived neurovascular MMP-9 activity is a critical mechanism underlying the exacerbation of ischemic brain injury by systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms may contribute to the poor clinical outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients presenting with antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
