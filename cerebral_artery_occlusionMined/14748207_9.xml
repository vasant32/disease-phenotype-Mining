<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors obtained cranial CT in 5 groups of rats subjected to 1 hour (n = 8), 2 hours (n = 11), 3 hours (n = 13), 4 hours (n = 13), or 6 hours (n = 14) of right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after CT, the authors removed the rats' brains and determined tissue water content by the dry-wet weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They correlated brain x-ray attenuation with brain tissue water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean brain tissue water content remained constant in the nonischemic left hemispheres at 77.9% +/- 0.6% and increased up to 79.3% +/- 1.0% in the right hemispheres after 6 hours of permanent right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>X-ray attenuation remained constant in the left hemispheres at 75.6 + 2.2 Hounsfield units (HU) and decreased to 71.7 +/- 3.4 HU in the right hemispheres after 6 hours of right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in x-ray attenuation correlated significantly with the increase in ischemic brain tissue water content (y = 217.3 - 1.8x x; r = .55, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That means that a 1% increase in hemispheric tissue water content causes a decrease in x-ray attenuation of 1.8 HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, immediate brain tissue net water uptake is associated with a decrease in x-ray attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT can monitor ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
