<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we tested commercially available silicon-coated nylon suture in the MCAO model and compared the results to traditional monofilament nylon suture occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided two groups, MCAO with 4-0 nylon suture (Group N, n=6) and MCAO with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated 4-0 nylon suture (Group S, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment included mortality rates, neurological evaluation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One rat died in each group from subarachanoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation demonstrated that Group S tended to have worse neurological outcomes than Group N, although this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On TTC stain Group S had significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than Group N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the commercially available <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated occlusion suture provides better occlusion of the middle cerebral artery than the traditional uncoated nylon suture </plain></SENT>
