<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism(s) regulating Nix protein activation remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies examine Nix protein expression and subcellular distribution in response to hypoxic stimuli in vivo and in culture and to two disparate apoptotic stimuli in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upregulation and translocation of Nix (by day 5) in hypoxic/serum-deprived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 cells, was preceded by Bax activation (by day 4) and caspase-3 processing (by day 2), suggesting that initiation of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro is a Nix-independent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an early Nix response (upregulation and translocation to the mitochondria) was observed after 6 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nix translocation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum before other histological (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, apoptotic body formation) or biochemical (Bax activation or caspase-3 cleavage) markers of damage were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While fundamental differences between <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in culture and in vivo likely explain the different temporal profiles of Nix, Bax, and caspase-3 activation observed, these studies show that like Bax, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> accumulation is a common event during Nix activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These are the first studies to show upregulation and translocation of Nix in the ischaemic brain and suggest Nix to be a novel therapeutic target in ischaemic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Nix upregulation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-treated SH-SY5Y cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated A1.1 cells supports a more generalized role for Nix in apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
