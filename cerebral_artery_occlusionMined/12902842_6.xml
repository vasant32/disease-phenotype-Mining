<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because l-arginine (l-arg) is the only known substrate for NO generation, the authors investigated the plasma profile of l-arg after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the relationship of L-arg concentrations in blood with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a clinical and experimental study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>l-Arg levels were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography in blood and CSF samples obtained on admission, and in blood 48 hours after inclusion, in 268 patients admitted with a hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> lasting 8.2 +/- 5.9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by days 4 to 7 using computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma l-arg profiles were analyzed in a separate group of 29 patients seen within 8 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (median, 4.5 hours) and in 24 male Fischer rats treated with subcutaneous vehicle or 20-mg/kg 1400W (a specific inducible NO synthase inhibitor) every 8 hours for 3 days after performing sham or permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma l-arg concentrations decreased after the ischemic event, both in patients and rats, and peaked between 6 and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients, there was a highly correlation between l-arg levels in CSF and plasma at 48 hours (r = 0.85, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF and plasma l-arg concentrations negatively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = -0.40 and r = -0.35, respectively, P&lt;0.001), and were significantly lower in patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> and in those with poor outcome (Barthel index &lt;85) at 90 days (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In rats, the administration of 1400W resulted in a 55% significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured 72 hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, an effect that correlated with the inhibition caused by 1400W on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced decrease of plasma l-arg concentrations at 6 to 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that determination of l-arg levels in blood might be useful to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of NO generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings might be helpful to guide future neuroprotective strategies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
