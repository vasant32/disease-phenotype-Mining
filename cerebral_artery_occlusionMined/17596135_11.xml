<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is approved for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, but it may increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> (ICB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which can be activated through the plasminogen/plasmin system, may contribute to ICB after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To explore the contribution of plasminogen, MMP-3 and MMP-9 to ICB associated with t-PA treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a thrombotic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O) model, ICB was studied in mice with genetic deficiencies of plasminogen (Plg(-/-)), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3(-/-)), or gelatinase B (MMP-9(-/-)) and their corresponding <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induction of MMP-3 and MMP-9 was also studied in C57BL/6 WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICB induced by t-PA (10 mg kg(-1)) was significantly less than WT in Plg(-/-) (P &lt; 0.05) and MMP-3(-/-) (P &lt; 0.05) but not in MMP-9(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 after t-PA treatment reduced ICB significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in MMP-3(+/+) mice, but had no effect on MMP-3(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 expression was significantly enhanced at the ischemic hemisphere; with placebo treatment, it was expressed only in neurons, whereas it was up-regulated in endothelial cells with t-PA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although MMP-9 expression was also significantly enhanced at the ischemic brain, the amount and the distribution were comparable in mice with and without t-PA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data with gene-deficient mice thus suggest that plasminogen and MMP-3 are relatively more important than MMP-9 for the increased ICB induced by t-PA treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
