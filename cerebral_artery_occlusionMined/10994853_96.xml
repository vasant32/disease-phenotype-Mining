<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice (n = 23; C57BL/6J) were divided into four groups: (1) mice (n = 5) were subjected to MCAO and transplanted with bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells (prelabeled by bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU) into the ischemic striatum, (2) MCAO alone (n = 8), (3) MCAO with injection of phosphate buffered saline (n = 5), and (4) bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells injected into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> striatum (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were killed at 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BrdU reactive cells survived and migrated a distance of approximately 2.2 mm from the grafting areas toward the ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BrdU reactive cells expressed the neuronal specific protein NeuN in 1% of BrdU stained cells and the astrocytic specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 8% of the BrdU stained cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery from a rotarod test (P &lt; 0.05) and modified neurologic severity score tests (including motor, sensory, and reflex; P &lt; 0.05) were significantly improved in the mice receiving bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells compared with MCAO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that the intrastriatal transplanted bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells survived in the ischemic brain and improved functional recovery of adult mice even though <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells may provide a new avenue to promote recovery of injured brain </plain></SENT>
