<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After survival times of one to three days, 28 days and six months, intracellular recordings from layers II/III pyramidal cells in the vicinity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> did not reveal any statistically significant changes in the intrinsic membrane properties when compared to age-matched control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a pronounced hyperexcitability could be observed upon orthodromic synaptic stimulation in neocortical slices obtained from mice 28 days after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-intensity electrical stimulation of the afferents elicited particularly in this group epileptiform extracellular field potential responses and intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials, that were longer in duration as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential was pharmacologically isolated in a bathing solution containing 0.1 mM Mg2+ and 10 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, the synaptic responses were longer and larger in the ischemic cortex as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher stimulus intensities evoked in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> medium a biphasic inhibitory postsynaptic potential, that contained in the 28 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group a prominent amino-phosphonovaleric acid-sensitive component, indicating a strong concurrent activation of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pronounced co-activation could only be observed in the 28 days ischemic group, and neither after one to three days or six months post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> nor in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitative analysis of the efficiency of stimulus- evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials recorded in amino-phosphono-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17418">valeric acid</z:chebi> revealed a reduction of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-mediated inhibition in ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this reduction in intracortical inhibition may already contribute to an augmentation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated excitation, our results do also indicate that the function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptors is transiently enhanced in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This transient hyperexcitability does not only cause cellular dysfunction in the vicinity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, but may also contribute to neuronal damage due to excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
