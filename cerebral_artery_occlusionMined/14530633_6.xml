<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a multiparametric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> MRI protocol was performed &lt; 6 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, as well as at day 2 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was monitored with transcranial Doppler or with conventional angiography (during local thrombolysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional improvement was defined as a change of &gt; or = 4 points on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with functional improvement, 78% (median, range 66-95%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) lesion escaped infarction compared with 28% (median, range -13 to 78%) in patients without neurological improvement (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the percentage of tissue with a time-to-peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) delay of &gt; or = 2 s not progressing to infarction was 80 and 4% in the groups with and without improvement, respectively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement was more frequent in patients with early (&lt; or = 3 h after presentation) recanalization, due to the salvage of larger areas of initially hypoperfused tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The salvage of hypoperfused tissue is a major factor influencing early neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
