<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the ability of 1.5 T clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect ferumoxides- labeled human neural stem cells (NSCs) that had been intravenously (i.v.) injected into a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To detect transplanted cells, hNSCs were labeled with ferumoxide then followed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-human NSC group, human NSCs (4 x 10(6)cells in 5 ml PBS) were injected via tail vein 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and the brains of the rats were scanned using a 1.5 T MRI unit over a period of 4 weeks (1 day before MCAo, then 1 and 3 days after cell injection, and weekly thereafter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In histologic sections, transplanted cells were identified by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> and anti-BrdU fluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions with hypointense signals on T2-weighted and 3D gradient echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images corresponded with areas stained by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi>, which suggested the presence of superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (SPIO) nanoparticles within the engrafted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypointense areas on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were observed in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas 3 days after cell injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that 1.5 T MRI has sufficient sensitivity to track engrafted stem cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
