<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether pretreatment with repeated electroacupuncture (EA) at the Baihui acupoint could induce ischemic tolerance against transient focal cerebral ischemic injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=10 for each): the control group consisted of animals receiving no treatment, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (ISO) group had animals that inhaled 1.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> for 30 min a day for 5 days, and animals in the EA group received electroacupuncture at the Baihui acupoint for 30 min a day for 5 days under 1.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, the middle cerebral artery was occluded with No. 3 nylon monofilament for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcomes were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were then assessed using 2% triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining after the neurological outcome evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological deficit score (NDS) of the EA group [1 (0-2)] was lower than that of the ISO group [2 (1-3)] and the control group [2 (1-4)], P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the EA group (38.3 +/- 25.4 mm(3)) was significantly smaller than that of the control group (220.5 +/- 66.0 mm(3)) and the ISO group (168.6 +/- 57.6 mm(3)) 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture at the Baihui acupoint 30 min a day for 5 days significantly reduces neurological injury induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
