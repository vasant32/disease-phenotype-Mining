<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were randomized into the following three groups: control group (sham operation group), model group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion damage group), and treatment group (puerarin group, chuanxiongzine-puerarin group, and nimodipine group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), synaptophysin, and interleukin-1 was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect was also evaluated micro-positive emission tomography with [F]fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion damage, the neurologic deficit score and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume percentage in treatment group were significantly lower than in the model group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Micro-positive emission tomography imaging showed that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the right temporal lobe and the right frontal lobe were significantly decreased in the model group in comparison with the sham operation group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism increased significantly in the puerarin group and the chuanxiongzine-puerarin group, compared with the model group (P&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of interleukin-1beta-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly higher in the model group than in the sham operation group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment, however, it was significantly decreased in the puerarin group (P&lt;0.05) and the chuanxiongzine-puerarin group (P&lt;0.01) compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SOD activity in the model group (P&lt;0.01) was lower than that in the sham operation group, whereas <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO content in the model group was more than that in the sham operation group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the chuanxiongzine-puerarin and puerarin treatment groups, SOD activity showed higher level compared with the model group (P&lt;0.01); however, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO content was decreased in the treatment group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Synaptophysin level was significantly lower in the model group compared with the sham operation group (P&lt;0.01), whereas the chuanxiongzine-puerarin and puerarin groups showed significantly higher values than the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that chuanxiongzine-puerarin played an important protective role against cerebral ischemic reperfusion damage in a rat model </plain></SENT>
