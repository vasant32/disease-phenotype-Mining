<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has long been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to compare the neuroprotective effect of systemic, head and local vascular cooling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> procedures in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=64) was induced by a 3 hour right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before reperfusion, ischemic animals (n=16 in each group) received <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (systemic, head or local vascular) or no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain temperature, infarction volume (n=8 in each group) and functional outcome (n=8 in each group) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regarding brain temperature, vascular cooling significantly reduced the temperature of ischemic territory in cortex from 37.2 +/- 0.1 to 33.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C and in striatum from 37.5 +/- 0.2 to 33.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C within 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This hypothermic condition remained for up to 60 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, systemic cooling reduced brain temperature at a similar level for six times longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the head cooling group, the target temperature was reached in 15 minutes, but returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> procedures induced neuroprotection, ischemic rats with vascular cooling showed significantly (p&lt;0.001) better neuroprotection with 10.7 +/- 2.6% infarction, compared to 54.2 +/- 1.9% (no treatment), 37.1 +/- 1.0% (head cooling) and 29.1 +/- 3.4% (systemic cooling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significantly (p&lt;0.001) better effects on motor function were also detected in vascular cooling groups at 14 and 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascular cooling appears to be the most effective in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improving functional outcome than the other two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> methods in a rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
