<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors exert neuroprotection in both cellular and animal models of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, which HDAC isoform (or isoforms) mediates this beneficial effect has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, gene levels of the HDAC isoforms were determined in the mouse cortex using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), whereas changes in the expression of individual zinc-dependent HDAC family members were evaluated by western blotting, 3, 12, 24 and 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male Kunming mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HDAC isoforms HDAC1-11 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed in the mouse cortex and differentially affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, there was a substantial increase in HDAC3, HDAC6 and HDAC11 expression during the early phases of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, indicating their contribution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, induction of HDAC3 and HDAC6 in cortical neurons by ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was confirmed in vivo and in vitro using double-labelled immunostaining and RT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, small hairpin (sh) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were used to selectively knock down HDAC3 or HDAC6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This knockdown appreciably promoted the survival of cortical neurons subjected to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study demonstrate the expression patterns of HDAC isoforms during experimental ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HDAC3 and HDAC6 were identified as potential mediators in the neurotoxicity of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting that specific therapeutic approaches may be considered according to HDAC subtype </plain></SENT>
