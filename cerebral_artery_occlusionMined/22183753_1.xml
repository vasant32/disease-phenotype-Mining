<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven in absentia homolog 1 (Siah1) regulates primarily the downstream sensor proteins factor inhibiting alpha subunit of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1 (FIH) under normoxic conditions and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> hydroxylases domain 3 (PHD3) under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the temporal and spatial changes of these <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> sensor proteins, Siah1, FIH, and PHD3, after 60 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) up to 72 hr after reperfusion in ICR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses showed that Siah1 was quickly and strongly induced in neuronal cells of the ischemic penumbra, with a peak at 2 hr, and gradually returned toward the sham control (SC) level until 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expressions of FIH and PHD3 were strongly visualized in the SC brains, and significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner with reperfusion until 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core region, Siah1, FIH, and PHD3 showed a similar change of strong and progressive decrease until 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence analyses showed a cytoplasmic localization of Siah1 and both cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations of FIH and PHD3 and that Siah1 plus FIH or PHD3 were well colocalized in same neuron at 2 hr after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> sensor proteins (Siah1, FIH, and PHD3) showed temporally and spatially different expressions after tMCAO, which could provide an effective neuroprotective reaction through their further downstream proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
