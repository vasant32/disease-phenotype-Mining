<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several useful behavioral tests exist for measuring behavioral recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in higher-order animals and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the increasing use of mice in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research, simple, reliable, and reproducible behavioral testing has become a priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As neuroprotective agents are tested, long-term outcome must be assessed, especially in studies focused on neuronal plasticity and regeneration after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory and others have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> (E2) is neuroprotective in rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined a battery of behavioral tests in male and female mice subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to determine the most sensitive tests for detecting sensorimotor dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to determine the functional significance of E2-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two tests, the corner test and the cylinder test, were able to differentiate between groups (sham and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) after several days of repeated testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cylinder test was sensitive to the neuroprotective/neurorestorative effects of E2, but 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the cylinder test was unable to distinguish between sham and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals treated with E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the corner test was able to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and sham animals even 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but did not distinguish animals treated with E2 vs. vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These tests provide a simple, rapid, reliable assessment of sensorimotor dysfunction in the mouse after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hormonal status influences speed of recovery on cylinder testing in animals of both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a short battery of tests including the neurological score, cylinder, and corner test may be adequate to rapidly and repeatedly assess sensorimotor dysfunction in mice of both genders </plain></SENT>
