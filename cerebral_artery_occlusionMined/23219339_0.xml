<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oxymatrine (OMT) is a major bioactive component derived from Sophora flavescens Ait (kushen), which is widely used in Chinese medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that it has neuroprotective effects; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focus on the mechanisms of pharmacologic action in OMT by detecting its pharmacological properties against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OMT prevented cerebral ischemic injury in mice induced via a 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a 24h reperfusion, in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro cultured neurons challenged with N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, 200Î¼M) for 30min showed significant decrease in the viability of neurons; however, OMT was able to protect neurons against induced neurotoxicity via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that OMT decreased the expression of Bax and repaired the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OMT significantly reversed the up-regulation of NR2B and inhibited the calcium overload in the cultured neurons after challenging the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OMT showed partial protection in the cortical neurons via down-regulation of NR2B containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors and up-regulation of Bcl-2 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide new insights into the development of natural therapeutic anti-oxidants against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
