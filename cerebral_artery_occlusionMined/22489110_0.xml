<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) models were established by intraluminally inserting a thread into middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) from left external carotid artery (ECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The successful rat models were randomly divided into 16 groups according to the orthogonal layout of [L(16)(4(5))] and treated by injecting picroside II intraperitoneally with different doses at various times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological behavioral function was evaluated by Bederson's test and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was measured by tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of neuron specific enolase (NSE) and neuroglial mark-protein S-100 were determined by immunohistochemisty assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the optimal compositions of the therapeutic dose and time window of picroside II in treating cerebral ischemic injury were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 1.5 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to Bederson's test, 1.0 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume, 1.5 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to the expressions of NSE and S-100 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the principle of the minimization of medication dose and maximization of therapeutic time window, the optimal composition of the therapeutic dose and time window of picroside II in treating cerebral ischemic injury should be achieved by injecting picroside II intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg body weight at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 1.5 h </plain></SENT>
