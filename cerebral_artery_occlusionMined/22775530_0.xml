<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapies may critically depend on the chosen experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to compare the post-ischemic neuroinflammation among murine permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO was induced by transtemporal electrocoagulation and 30 minutes or 90 minutes transient MCAO was induced by intraluminal filament in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltration of leukocyte subpopulations was quantified by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cytokine and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration was noted at 24 h after transient MCAO, but did not further increase until 5 days in the permanent MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few T cells were observed in both MCAO models at 24 h, but permanent MCAO demonstrated much more infiltrating T cells at 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pronounced microglial activation was evident at 24 h and 5 days after permanent but not after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of invading NK cells and expression of MHCII on CD11b+ cells did not differ among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five days after MCAO, the expression of IL-1, TNF-α and IFN-γ and of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was significantly higher in the permanent than in the transient MCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cellular and humoral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> differs substantially among commonly used MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neuroinflammation is more pronounced after permanent electrocoagulatory MCAO compared with 30 minutes and 90 minutes filament-MCAO </plain></SENT>
