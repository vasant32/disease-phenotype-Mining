<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that reduction of blood pressure (BP) immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion reduced neurovascular damage and improved functional outcome after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> is particularly effective in improving long-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine if early BP lowering with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, in the presence of an occluded cerebral artery, will reduce injury and improve outcome after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats underwent 24 h or 7 days of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single dose of 1 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> was administered intravenously at 3 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received neurobehavioral testing at 3 h, 24 h, and 7 days, and blood pressure was measured by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals had brain tissue collected for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (24 h and 7 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (24 h only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">Candesartan</z:chebi> significantly decreased blood pressure, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (-20%; p=0.021), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> excess (-50%; p=0.0013), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (-35%; p=0.0005) at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a reduced cerebral perfusion deficit (p=0.034) in the ischemic hemisphere compared with saline and significantly improved Bederson scores and paw grasp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF were significantly increased by MCAO, but there were no differences between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>- and saline-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in behavioral outcome at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BP lowering with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> reduces early brain injury after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even when the artery remains occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The early benefits were not sustained at 7 days, as seen in reperfused animals, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection and neurorestorative properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> may occur by separate distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
