<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND-: Adiponectin is a hormone produced in and released from adipose cells, which has been shown to have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory actions in peripheral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cell surface adiponectin receptors (ADRs) mediate the majority of the known biological actions of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus far, ADR expression in the brain has been demonstrated in the arcuate and the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, where its activation affects food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that levels of circulating adiponectin increase after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but the role of adiponectin receptor activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis and its functional outcome is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS-: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in C57BL/6 mice by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neuronal cultures were established from individual embryonic neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (GD), cultured neurons were incubated in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-free Locke's medium for 6, 12 or 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For combined oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), neurons were incubated in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-free Locke's medium in an oxygen-free chamber with 95% N2/5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> atmosphere for either 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary neurons and brain tissues were analysed for Adiponectin and ADRs using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblot and immunochemistry methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS-: Cortical neurons express ADR1 and ADR2, and that the levels of ADR1 are increased in neurons in response to in vitro or in vivo ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurons treated with either globular or trimeric adiponectin exhibited increased vulnerability to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation which was associated with increased activation of a pro-apoptotic signaling cascade involving p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS-: This study reveals a novel pathogenic role for adiponectin and adiponectin receptor activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We show that cortical neurons express ADRs and reveal a pro-apoptotic role for ADR1 activation in neurons, which may render them vulnerable to ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
