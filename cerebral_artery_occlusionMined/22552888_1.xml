<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, some studies suggested that inhibition of Rho-kinase (ROCK) prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury through inhibiting inflammatory reaction, increasing cerebral blood flow, modulating the neuronal actin cytoskeleton polymerization, and preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and p25/CDK5 increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information regarding the effects of ROCK inhibitor on the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined whether ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, inhibited ischemic neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome10 (PTEN)/Akt/signal pathway in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats received ROCK inhibitor, fasudil (10 mg/kg), at 30 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and caspase-3 activity was significantly decreased by fasudil with improvement of neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the beneficial effects of fasudil were attenuated by the co-application of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasudil maintained postischemic Akt activity at relatively proper level and decreased the augmentation of PTEN and ROCK activity in the penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fasudil inhibited attenuation of GSK-Î² and Bad phosphorylation in the penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the findings provide another consideration that fasudil protects the brain against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury through decreasing neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reveals the link between the ROCK inhibition and the PTEN/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
