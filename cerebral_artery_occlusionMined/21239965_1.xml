<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that the novel neuropeptide orexin-A may play an essential role during neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the function of orexin-A during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was shown to be activated by orexin-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that administration of exogenous orexin-A can attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury through the facilitation of HIF-1α expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with different doses of orexin-A or vehicle before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the action of HIF-1α in the neuroprotective effects of orexin-A, the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 was used alone or combined with orexin-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested for immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Orexin-A significantly ameliorated neurologic deficit scores and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of 30 μg/kg orexin-A showed optimal neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was still present 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, orexin-A decreased the number of apoptotic cells and significantly enhanced HIF-1α expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the facilitation of HIF-1α expression was accompanied with inhibition of von Hippel-Lindau expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Administration of HIF-1α inhibitor suppressed the increase of HIF-1α and reversed the neuroprotective effects of orexin-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orexin-A has a neuroprotective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These effects may be mediated through the HIF-1α pathway </plain></SENT>
