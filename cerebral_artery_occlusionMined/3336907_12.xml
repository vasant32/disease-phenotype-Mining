<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the biomechanical properties of brain play an important role in the development of early ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in cats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue pressure, tissue compliance, and tissue resistance were measured from the gray matter in the core and the periphery of the middle cerebral artery territory for 6 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow and water content were also measured from the same areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ventricular fluid pressure was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue pressure rose gradually in the core, where flow was 6 ml/100 g/min, over 4 hours and then stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pressure gradient measured between edematous tissue and ventricular fluid was 5.3 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue resistance increased 1 hour after occlusion when water content increased to 10 mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Later, when water content increased by 40 mg/g, tissue resistance decreased and tissue compliance increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the periphery, where flow was 17.6 ml/100 g/min, tissue pressure rose slightly while tissue compliance and tissue resistance did not change within 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that as ischemic injury progresses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid accumulates in highly compliant brain parenchyma, then migrates through highly conductive tissue into the cerebrospinal fluid spaces, driven by the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the edematous tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
