<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">Docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA; 22:6n-3), an omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, is the precursor of neuroprotectin D1, which downregulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and, in turn, promotes cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess whether DHA would show neuroprotective efficacy when systemically administered in different doses after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and subjected to 2 hour of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with either DHA (low doses=3.5 or 7 mg/kg; medium doses=16 or 35 mg/kg; and high dose=70 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline intravenously 3 hours after MCAo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was evaluated during occlusion (60 minutes) and on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAo, brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only the low and medium doses of DHA significantly improved the neurologic score compared with vehicle-treated rats at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DHA markedly reduced total corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated groups compared with vehicle-treated rats (3.5 mg/kg, 26+/-9 mm(3); 7 mg/kg, 46+/-12 mm(3); 16 mg/kg, 37+/-5 mm(3); and 35 mg/kg, 34+/-15 mm(3) vs vehicle, 94+/-12 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were also significantly reduced by treatment with DHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neuroprotective effects were observed with 70 mg/kg DHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DHA experimental therapy at low and medium doses improves neurologic and histologic outcomes after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and might provide benefits in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
