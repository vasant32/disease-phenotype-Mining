<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of circulating factors and protein kinase Cβ on blood-brain barrier permeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> during hyperglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats that were hyperglycemic by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg) for 5 to 6 days underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 hours with 2 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier permeability was measured in middle cerebral arteries that were ischemic (MCAO) or nonischemic (CTL) and perfused with plasma (20% in buffer) from MCAO or CTL animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A separate set of MCAO vessels was perfused with the protein kinase Cβ inhibitor CGP53353 (0.5 μmol/L) and permeability measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lastly, hyperglycemic rats were treated intravenously with CGP53353 (10 or 100 μg/kg or vehicle 15 minutes before reperfusion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation measured by wet:dry weights (n=6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCAO vessels had increased permeability compared with controls regardless of the plasma perfusate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Permeability (water flux, μm(3)×10(8)) of CTL vessel/CTL plasma (n=8), CTL vessel/MCAO plasma (n=7), MCAO vessel/CTL plasma (n=6), and MCAO vessel/MCAO plasma (n=6) was 0.98±0.11, 1.13±0.07, 1.36±0.02, and 1.34±0.06; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of protein kinase Cβ in MCAO vessels (n=6) reversed the increase in permeability (0.92±0.1; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> versus normoglycemia after MCAO (water content=78.84%±0.11% versus 81.38%±0.21%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of protein kinase Cβ with 10 or 100 μg/kg CGP53353 during reperfusion prevented the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in hyperglycemic animals (water content=79.54%±0.56% and 79.99%±0.43%; P&lt;0.01 versus vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the pronounced vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> that occurs during hyperglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is mediated in large part by activation of protein kinase Cβ </plain></SENT>
