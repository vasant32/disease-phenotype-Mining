<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of cerebral injury at 23 h after reperfusion indicated that infarction volumes were increased in diabetic rats as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats was accompanied by increased expression of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and neuroserpin (NSP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the expression of NSP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but not t-PA, u-PA and PAI-1 mRNA, was reduced to undetectable levels at 11 and 23 h after reperfusion in diabetic rats as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although activity of PA (t-PA and u-PA) and the ratio of PA/PAI were increased at 5 h after reperfusion in both ischemic brains of diabetic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, the levels in diabetic rats were lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the exacerbation of ischemic injury in diabetic rats may be related to the reduction of fibrinolytic component and the neuroprotective role of NSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further study of the efficacy of NSP in the pathogenesis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may provide novel insights </plain></SENT>
