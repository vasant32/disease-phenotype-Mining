<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substantial evidence indicates that mitochondria are a major checkpoint in several pathways leading to neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but discerning critical propagation stages from downstream consequences has been difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition (mPT) may be critical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this hypothesis, identify potential therapeutics, and screen for new uses for established drugs with known toxicity, 1,040 FDA-approved drugs and other bioactive compounds were tested as potential mPT inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the identification of 28 structurally related drugs, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, capable of delaying the mPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically achievable doses of one drug in this general structural class that inhibits mPT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi>, were protective in both in vitro and mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> protected primary neuronal cultures subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological impairment in mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results, in conjunction with new insights provided to older studies, (a) suggest a class of safe, tolerable drugs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>; (b) provide new tools for understanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> roles in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; (c) demonstrate the clinical/experimental value of screening collections of bioactive compounds enriched in clinically available agents; and (d) provide discovery-based evidence that mPT is an essential, causative event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related injury </plain></SENT>
