<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebrocortical electrical activity, extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> activity, and microcirculation indicated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence were measured during occlusion as well as during recirculation in the core of the middle cerebral artery territory, while the cerebral metabolic rate for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (ICMRgl) was measured at the end of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cats were classified into either mildly or moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups based on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the cerebrocortical electrical activity on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 12 cats with only a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, six were administered GM1 intravenously 30 minutes after occlusion, while six cats were not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 12 cats with a moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, six were treated and six were left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six additional cats, only a sham insult was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cats with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, GM1 treatment significantly increased lCMRgl in the peripheral middle cerebral artery territory compared with the untreated cats; for the six treated cats, lCMRgl was normalized toward the control level, whereas it was depressed in the six untreated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no other significant effects of GM1 treatment on the other measured parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A potential protective effect of anesthesia is discussed </plain></SENT>
