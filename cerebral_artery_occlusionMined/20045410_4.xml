<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to test the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sleep deprivation on early outcome following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=20) were subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by reversible right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 rats, MCAO was performed just after 6-h of total sleep deprivation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSD</z:e>) by "gentle handling", whereas the other rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function during the first week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was monitored using a battery of behavioral tests investigating the asymmetry of sensorimotor deficit (tape removal test and cylinder test), bilateral sensorimotor coordination (rotor-rod and Inclined plane) and memory (T-maze and radial maze) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, control rats had impaired behavioral performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest impairment was noted in the tape test where the tape removal time from the left forelimb (contralateral to MCAO) was increased by approximately 10 fold (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rats subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSD</z:e> had complete recovery of sensorimotor performance consistent with a 2.5 fold smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reduced morphological signs of neuronal injury at day 7 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSD</z:e> induces a neuroprotective response that limits the severity of a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, similar to rapid ischemic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
