<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), one of the proinflammatory chemokines, can attract monocytes to the tissue where <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 elevation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not been explored in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that elevated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels would lead to increased influx of monocytes and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with partial reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in blood pressure, blood flow, or vascular architecture between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and transgenic MBP-JE mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four to 48 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were significantly larger in MBP-JE mice than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls and were accompanied by increased local transmigration and perivascular accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 can contribute to inflammatory injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
