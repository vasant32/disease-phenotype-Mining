<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) was originally identified as a ubiquitously expressed, abundant nonhistone DNA-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was found to act as a cytokine-like mediator of delayed endotoxin <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that HMGB1 is massively released extracellularly and plays a cytokine-like function in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the expression profile and cellular distribution of HMGB1 in rat brain after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of HMGB1 in infarction areas in the ipsilateral sides gradually declined over 2 days after 1 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to below the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after 3 days of reperfusion, HMGB1 level increased to above the basal level, especially in infarction cores, and this delayed induction was then maintained for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody against HMGB1 revealed its detailed expression pattern and subcellular localization in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 was found to be widely expressed throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and to be localized to the nuclei of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurons and oligodendrocyte-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 hr of MCAO, HMGB1 immediately translocated from the neuron nuclei to the cytoplasm and subsequently was depleted from neurons during the excitotoxicity-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> damaging process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, beginning 2 days after reperfusion, HMGB1 was notably induced in activated microglia, astrocytes, and in microvascular structures, and these delayed gradual inductions were sustained for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that HMGB1 functions as a cytokine-like mediator in a paracrine and autocrine manner in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
