<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TIMP-3 promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ischemic neurons by inhibiting proteolysis of TNF-α superfamily of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since OLs undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we hypothesized that TIMP-3 contributes to OL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in Timp-3 knockout (KO) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) mice with 24 or 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in white matter was investigated by stereology and TUNEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mature or immature OLs were identified using antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase-π (GST-π) and galactocerebroside (GalC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression and level of proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein activities were determined using a FRET <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of OL-like cells was detected at 72 h only in WT ischemic white matter where TUNEL showed greater cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TIMP-3 expression was increased in WT reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GST-π was reduced in ischemic white matter of WT mice compared with WT shams with no difference between KO and WT at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GalC level was significantly increased in both KO and WT ischemic white matter at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in GalC in KO mice was significantly higher than WT; most TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic white matter expressed GalC, suggesting TIMP-3 deficiency protects the immature OLs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase-3 at 72 h in WT white matter than in KO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Greater expression of MMP-3 and -9 was seen in reactive astrocytes and/or microglia/macrophages in WT at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found more microglia/macrophages in WT than in KO, which were the predominant source of increased TNF-α detected in the ischemic white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>TACE activity was significantly increased in ischemic WT white matter, which was expressed in active microglia/macrophages and OLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> leads to proliferation of immature OLs in white matter and that TIMP-3 contributes to a caspase-3-dependent immature OL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via TNF-α-mediated neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be needed to delineate the role of MMP-3 and MMP-9 that were increased in the Timp-3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
