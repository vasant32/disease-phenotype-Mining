<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GDNF significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) when GDNF was topically applied at 0 and 1 h of reperfusion, but became insignificant at 3 h as compared to vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of GDNF was closely related to the significant reduction of the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells as well as immunofluorescently positive cells for active forms of caspases, especially active caspase-3 but not -9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study showed that topical application of GDNF significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a time-dependent manner, while the therapeutic time window was shorter than other <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi> such as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (MK-801) and a free radical scavenger (alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-nitrone, PBN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of GDNF was stronger in suppressing active caspase-3 than active caspase-9 </plain></SENT>
