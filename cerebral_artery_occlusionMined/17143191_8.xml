<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> treatment starting early (3 h) and delayed (24 h) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with reperfusion was investigated in normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subcutaneous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) or vehicle was initiated 3 or 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO and continued for seven consecutive days (n=20 per group and timepoint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was evaluated daily using two different scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> volumes were determined in rats 2 or 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded before and after the application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were markedly decreased with the high dose, but only moderately decreased with the low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-treated rats showed marked neurological deficits 24 h after MCAO, which gradually improved with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">Candesartan</z:chebi> improved neurological outcomes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> timepoints only when treatment was started 3, but not 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced on days 2 and 7 after MCAO in rats treated with the low but not the high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that only an early but not a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> exerts neuroprotection after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of neurological impairments did not correlate with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which was reduced only after the low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> failed to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, probably because of an excessive blood pressure decrease </plain></SENT>
