<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cannabinoid receptor activation has been shown to modulate both neurotransmission (CB(1)) and neuroinflammatory (CB(2)) responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting reports in the literature describing the influence of cannabinoid receptor activation on ischemic/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate how changing the balance between CB(1) and CB(2) activation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> influences outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CB(1) and CB(2) expression were tested at different times after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals subjected to 1 h MCAO were randomly assigned to receive different treatments: a CB(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, a CB(2) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, a CB(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, a CB(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> plus CB(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, a CB(2) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> plus CB(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> or an equal volume of vehicle as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia; cerebral</z:e> infarction and neurological deficit were tested 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral CB(1) and CB(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression undertook dynamic changes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The selective CB(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> significantly decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by 47%; the selective CB(2) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> increased infarction by 26% after 1 h MCAO followed by 23 h reperfusion in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most striking changes were obtained by combining a CB(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with a CB(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This combination elevated the cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reduced infarction by 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury, inhibition of CB(1) receptor activation is protective while inhibition of CB(2) receptor activation is detrimental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The greatest degree of neuroprotection was obtained by combining an inhibitor of CB(1) activation with an exogenous CB(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
