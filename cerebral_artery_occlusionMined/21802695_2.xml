<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that Niaspan (40 mg/kg) administered at 2h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induces neuroprotection, while low dose Niaspan (20mg/kg) does not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but its use remains limited by a narrow therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that intravenous administration of tPA 4h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats does not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether combination treatment with low-dose Niaspan (20mg/kg) and tPA administered 4h after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and provides neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with low-dose Niaspan (20mg/kg) alone (n = 7), tPA (10mg/kg) alone (n = 7), combination of low-dose Niaspan and tPA (n = 7), or saline control (n = 9), 4h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A battery of functional outcome tests was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 7 days after MCAo and lesion volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To investigate the underlying mechanism of combination treatment neuroprotective effect, deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cleaved caspase-3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) immunostaining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combination treatment with low-dose Niaspan and tPA significantly improved functional outcome compared to the saline control group (p&lt;0.05), while treatment with Niaspan or tPA alone did not significantly improve functional outcome compared to saline control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, combination treatment significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to saline control group (p = 0.006) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly correlated with functional outcome (p = 0.0008; r = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy with Niaspan or tPA did not significantly decrease <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to saline control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> as measured by significant reduction in the number of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 expression in the ischemic brain compared to saline control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment also significantly reduced the expression of TNF-alpha and TLR-4 in the ischemic brain compared to Niaspan, tPA and saline treatment groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction between Niaspan and tPA on the TNF-alpha expression was detected (p&lt;0.05), indicating a synergy effect in the combination treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with combination of low-dose Niaspan and tPA at 4h after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improves neurological outcome and provides neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of combination treatment were associated with reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and attenuation of TNF-alpha and TLR-4 expression </plain></SENT>
