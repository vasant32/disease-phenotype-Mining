<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have provided evidence to suggest systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> administration prevented or reversed the sympathoexcitation observed following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation sought to determine the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> injected directly into the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) on the MCAO-induced sympathoexcitation as well as the role of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in mediating the sympathoexcitatory response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> thiobutabarbitol (100 mg/kg) and were instrumented to continuously record blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, there was a significant increase in RSNA (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 8.3 +/- 0.6 microV/s; P &lt; 0.05) which was significantly attenuated by the prior bilateral injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> (0.5 microM in 200 nl) into the PBN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (5% in 200 nl) directly into the RVLM resulted in only a slight reduction in the magnitude of the MCAO-induced sympathoexcitation (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracellular electrophysiological recordings from RVLM neurons demonstrated that MCAO did not produce any significant change in neuronal activity over the experimental time course (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, bilateral injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> into the PBN prior to MCAO or sham conditions did not result in any significant change in RVLM neuronal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors in the PBN play a major role in modulating the sympathoexcitatory response from ischemic forebrain nuclei, and that the pathway from the PBN to sympathetic preganglionic nuclei may not involve a synapse in the RVLM </plain></SENT>
