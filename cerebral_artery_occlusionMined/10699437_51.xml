<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that a composite graft of fresh bone marrow (BM) along with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transplanted into the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) of rat brain, facilitates BM cells to survive and differentiate, and improves functional recovery after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fresh BM was harvested from adult rats injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats (n=37) were subjected to 2h of MCAo, received grafts at 24h and were sacrificed at 7days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Test groups consisted of: (1) control - MCAo alone (n=9); (2) injection of phosphate buffered saline (n=4); (3) transplantation of BM (n=8); (4) injection of BDNF (n=7); and (5) transplantation of BM with BDNF (n=9) into the IBZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells derived from the BM stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (rotarod motor test; adhesive-removal somatosensory test) were performed before and 7days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that intracerebral grafting of a combination of BM with BDNF enhances differentiation of BM cells and significantly improves motor recovery of rotarod (P&lt;0.05) and adhesive-removal (P&lt;0.05) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that BM along with neurotrophic factors may provide a powerful autoplastic therapy for human neurological injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
