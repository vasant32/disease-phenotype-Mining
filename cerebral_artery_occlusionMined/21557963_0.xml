<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on this, we studied whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> could modulate the secondary pathology described in the thalamus of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> could decrease inflammatory reaction and Aβ load in the thalamus of MCAO rats, which in turn is reflected in improved behavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty male Wistar rats (250-340 g) were subjected to sham-operation or transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (120 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> (4 0mg/kg/day, per os) was administrated for 27 days beginning the treatment on post-operative day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO controls were given vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor impairment was assessed using the limb-placing, tapered ledged beam-walking and cylinder tests during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rats were perfused for histology on postoperative day 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological data showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> did not affect Aβ or calcium load in the thalamus of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, behavioral tests did not show significant difference between vehicle- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>-treated MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present data do not support the idea that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> reduces the secondary Aβ/calcium pathology in the thalamus or associated sensorimotor impairment following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
