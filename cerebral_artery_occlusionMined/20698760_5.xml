<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient care stands to benefit from an improved understanding of the interactive biochemistry underlying neurotrauma pathobiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the power of neuroproteomics to contrast biochemical responses following ischemic and traumatic brain injuries in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was employed in groups of 30-min and 2-h focal neocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroproteomes were assessed via tandem <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> exchange chromatography-gel electrophoresis, followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO results were compared with those from a previous study of focal contusional brain injury employing the same methodology to characterize homologous neocortical tissues at 2 days post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-min MCAO neuroproteome depicted abridged energy production involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25901">pentose</z:chebi> phosphate, modulated synaptic function and plasticity, and increased chaperone activity and cell survival factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-h MCAO data indicated near complete loss of ATP production, synaptic dysfunction with degraded cytoarchitecture, more conservative chaperone activity, and additional cell survival factors than those seen in the 30-min MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TBI group exhibited disrupted metabolism, but with retained malate shuttle functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Synaptic dysfunction and cytoarchitectural degradation resembled the 2-h MCAO group; however, chaperone and cell survival factors were more depressed following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the utility of neuroproteomics for characterizing interactive biochemistry for profiling and contrasting the molecular aspects underlying the pathobiological differences between types of brain injuries </plain></SENT>
