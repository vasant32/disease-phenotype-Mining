<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We explored the therapeutic potential of a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (F20) derived from the filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> in a model of ischemic cell injury after transient (2 hours) middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into two groups-(1) F20 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> group: rats (n = 11) were subjected to 2 hours of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and F20 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was administered intravenously (50 nmol) at 0 hours of reperfusion and intraperitoneally (150 nmol/dose) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 22, and 30 hours of reperfusion; (2) control group: rats (n = 10) were administered <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> F23 (a scrambled version of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> F20) with the same experimental protocol as the F20 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six hours after reperfusion, animals were sacrificed, and brain tissue was stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> for evaluation of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To measure neutrophil numbers in ischemic tissue, myeloperoxidase (MPO) immunostaining was performed on a coronal cerebral section in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction of ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (36%, p &lt; 0.05) in the F20 group of animals compared with the F23 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area of the ischemic lesion was highly correlated with the numbers of the immunoreactive MPO cells (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that the F20 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and intraparenchymal neutrophil numbers after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
