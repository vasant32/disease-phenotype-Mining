<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Dachuanxiongwan on the expression of vascular epithelial growth factor in the rats after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion model was established by blocking the middle cerebral artery of the rats with a nylon thread for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were randomly divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the group of rats were administered with DCXW, 4.13 g/kg x d, twice a day for 3 days by gavaging, while other group were given the same volume of saline as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours after reperfusion, the neuropathological function of the rats were evaluated according to Longa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were then sacrificed and the samples of cerebrum were processed and embedded in paraffin and cut into sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF was determined by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The score of the neuropathological function of the DCXW treated group (1.5 +/- 0.71) was lower than that of the control group (2.3 +/- 0.82, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More VEGF-positive cells were found in the rats treated with DCXW than those in the control group (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DCXW upgrades the expression of VEGF and may have a positive effect on the cerebrum following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
