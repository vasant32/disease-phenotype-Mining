<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypertonic saline (HS) has been advocated as a hyperosmolar agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, especially after traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that continuous intravenous HS administered during reperfusion from transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> attenuates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by the intraluminal occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion, rats received a 10-mL/kg intravenous bolus of 0.9% saline (SAL, n=8) or 7.5% SAL (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> 50:50, n=8) followed by a continuous infusion for 22 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments, ischemic damage was determined in cohorts treated with equivolumetric 3% saline (n=8) or 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a third series, regional cerebral blood flow was measured ([(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography) at 6 hours of reperfusion in 7.5%-SAL-treated (n=5) or SAL-treated (n=5) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In SAL rats, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> was 137+/-3 and 138+/-2 mEq/L (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) at baseline and 22 hours of reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7.5% SAL, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> was 136+/-2 and 154+/-2 mEq/L at baseline and reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables and reduction in laser-Doppler signal during MCAO and early reperfusion were not different between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was larger in 7.5%-SAL-treated rats (121+/-14 mm(3); 30+/-3% of contralateral cortex; P&lt;0.05) than in SAL (64+/-15 mm(3); 16+/-4% of contralateral cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was unchanged by HS therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral cortical tissue volume was increased relative to the contralateral side (by 26+/-5% with SAL; by 41+/-5% with 7.5% SAL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ischemic damage was unaffected by 3%-SAL or 20%-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> treatment compared with SAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow during reperfusion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, but there was no evidence of postischemic hypoperfusion or blood flow maldistribution in 7.5%-SAL-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003228'>hypernatremia</z:hpo> resulting from postischemic HS infusion worsens cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effect is not linked to exacerbation of delayed hypoperfusion during early reperfusion (6 hours); however, blood flow defects at later recovery time points remain to be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results may have implications for HS therapy in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
