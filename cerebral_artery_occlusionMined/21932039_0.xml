<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental animal studies have demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays an essential role during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to oxidizing macromolecules leading to cell injury, oxidants are also involved in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/survival signal pathways and cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) represents one of the major regulators implicated in the endogenous defense system against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression and activation status of Nrf2 under <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like conditions using the temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inactive Nrf2 is proteasomal degraded within minutes but stabilized during activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed Nrf2 activation and the resulting accumulation in post-ischemic rat brain cells using double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies directed against Nrf2 and cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The core <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region showed no obvious positive staining signal for Nrf2 24 h after the initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Nrf2 immunoreactivity was detectable in the ipsilateral penumbra where microglia, astrocytes, and neurons contained Nrf2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Nrf2 was also significantly upregulated in neurons but not in other cell types of the unaffected contralateral site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide strong evidence that Nrf2 is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the penumbra but not core region and indicate the presence of a systemic Nrf2 activator independent from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
