<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Integrins participate in cerebral microvascular integrity and signaling during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/ reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The integrin subunits alpha 1, alpha 6, and beta 1 are distributed identically on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in epithelium indicate that integrin alpha 6 beta 4, which interacts with laminin-5 in the basal lamina/extracellular matrix, is unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study describes the exact location of alpha 6, beta 4, and alpha 6 beta 4 and that their responses in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are relevant to astrocyte-matrix interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and subsequent reperfusion on the microvascular expression of alpha 6 beta 4 and laminin-5 in regions of cellular injury (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> incorporation) was examined in 15 nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Well-characterized antibodies against human alpha 6, beta 4, alpha 6 beta 4, laminin-5 and laminin-1, endothelial CD31, and vascular markers were measured with computerized video imaging and laser confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 was localized on astrocytes where it connects with the extracellular matrix at the astrocyte-vessel interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It represented 59.3 +/- 16.4% of alpha 6 antigen in cerebral microvessels &lt; 100 microns in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the significant reduction in alpha 6 expression (2P &lt; .001) was accompanied by decreases in beta 4/laminin-5 (0.76 +/- 0.03 to 0.20 +/- 0.09; 2P = .001) and alpha 6 beta 4/laminin-5 (0.73 +/- 0.18 to 0.25 +/- 0.11; 2P = .001) in the region of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parallel changes in laminin-5 and laminin-1 were less pronounced and coincided by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a potential role of integrin alpha 6 beta 4 in the brain, where it mediates astrocyte-matrix interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dramatic disappearance of alpha 6 beta 4 relative to its ligands reflects early loss of integrity between the astrocyte and the vessel wall in selected microvessels in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
