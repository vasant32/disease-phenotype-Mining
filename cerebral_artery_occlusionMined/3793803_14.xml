<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of prostacyclin, nimodipine, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> on local cerebral pH (LCpH) and CBF (LCBF) in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)-occluded rats were compared with those in controls and others receiving nimodipine carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LCpH and LCBF were determined simultaneously by a double-label autoradiographic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infusions were intravenous, started 15 min following the occlusion, and ended at decapitation 4 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dosages were 0.5 micrograms/kg/min for nimodipine, 40 micrograms/kg/min for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, and 5 ng/kg/min for prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical LCpH in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory of control and carrier-infused rats varied between 6.72 +/- 0.05 and 6.76 +/- 0.05 (means +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values were significantly lower than the LCpH in the same structures in the contralateral hemisphere (7.09 +/- 0.06; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LCBF on the side of occlusion varied between 54 +/- 5 ml/100 g/min for the parietal and 57 +/- 7 ml/100 g/min for the sensorimotor cortex, while on the contralateral side, LCBF in these same structures was 190 +/- 18 and 191 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LCpH was not modified by prostacyclin treatment following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, but the pH in the structures that were acidotic in the controls became indistinguishable from contralateral values in nimodipine- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LCBF was statistically higher than controls in many structures only in rats treated with prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the correction of LCpH produced by calcium blockers was not related to an effect they had on blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving calcium blockers tended to have smaller areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may have therapeutic implications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
