<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the proliferation and fate of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we measured the temporal and spatial profiles of proliferation of cells and the phenotypic fate of proliferating cells in ischemic brain in a model of embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cells were labeled by injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in a pulse or a cumulative protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the temporal profile of proliferating cells, ischemic rats were injected with BrdU every 4 h for 12 h on the day preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 2-14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed significant increases in numbers of proliferating cells in the ipsilateral cortex and subventricular zone 2-14 days with a peak at 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To maximize labeling of proliferating cells, a single daily injection of BrdU was administered over a 14-day period starting the day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed either 2 h or 28 days after the last injection of BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in numbers of BrdU immunoreactive cells in the subventricular zone was coincident with a significant increase in numbers of BrdU immunoreactive cells in the olfactory bulb 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and numbers of BrdU immunoreactive cells did not significantly increase in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 28 days after the last labeling, the number of BrdU labeled cells decreased by 90% compared with number at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clusters of BrdU labeled cells were present in the cortex distal to the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Numerous cells immunostained for the polysialylated form of the neuronal cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule were detected in the ipsilateral subventricular zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 6% of BrdU labeled cells exhibited glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the cortex and subcortex and no BrdU labeled cells expressed neuronal protein markers (neural nuclear protein and microtubule associated protein-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From these data we suggest that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces transient and regional specific increases in cell proliferation in the ipsilateral hemisphere and that proliferating progenitor cells may exist in the adult cortex </plain></SENT>
