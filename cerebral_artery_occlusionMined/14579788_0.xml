<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four days after reperfusion, electrophysiology records revealed reduced LTP in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus of ischemic rats, while treatment with clau (10 mg kg-1 p.o. once daily) improved LTP impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fractional increase of population spike amplitude 20-50 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> was significantly larger in ischemic rats treated with clau than vehicle treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ipsilateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of TUNEL-positive particles were significantly reduced after treatment with clau compared with vehicle group (78.8 +/- 17.9 versus 105.8 +/- 27.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> accumulation showed that clau treatment (55.0 +/- 8.5) elevated numbers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi>-positive particles in the ipsilateral striatum compared with vehicle group (40.4 +/- 7.5) These results demonstrate that clau can improve LTP impairment in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and enhance cell survival in the striatum compared to the vehicle-treated rats four days following ischemic damage and its protective effect on mitochondria may partially underlie its action </plain></SENT>
