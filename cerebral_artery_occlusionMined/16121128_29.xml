<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which BMDCs support vessel remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using mouse chimeras that express enhanced green fluorescent protein in reconstituted bone marrow, we investigated the role of BMDCs in revascularization and brain repair after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of murine brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, two populations of BMDCs were observed, one in the brain parenchyma and another associated with the vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of BMDCs that infiltrated the brain parenchyma peaked at 7 days and persisted through 14 days, the last time point observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of BMDCs were characterized as microglia, based on cell-type-specific marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a robust angiogenic response after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow-derived cells associated with remodeling blood vessels were negative for endothelial markers, but were surrounded by basal lamina and expressed desmin and vimentin, identifying these cells as pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantification of BMDCs that expressed desmin revealed increasing desmin expression with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perivascular associated BMDCs that expressed desmin were immunoreactive for the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that pericytes are recruited from the periphery and are involved in blood vessel stabilization during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
