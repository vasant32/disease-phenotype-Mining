<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genes involved in astrocyte function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we performed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> differential display in astrocytes after oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected a robust down-regulation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> that was accompanied by a sharp decrease in protein levels and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OGD-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was increased by the combined deletion of S6K1 and S6K2 genes, as well as by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> that inhibits S6K1 activity by acting on the upstream regulator mTOR (mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes lacking S6K1 and S6K2 (S6K1;S6K2-/-) displayed a defect in BAD phosphorylation and in the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore reactive oxygen species were increased while translation recovery was impaired in S6K-deficient astrocytes following OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rescue of either S6K1 or S6K2 expression by adenoviral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> revealed that protective functions were specifically mediated by S6K1, because this isoform selectively promoted resistance to OGD and reduction of ROS levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, "in vivo" effects of S6K suppression were analyzed in the permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in which absence of S6K expression increased mortality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, this article uncovers a protective role for astrocyte S6K1 against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, indicating a functional pathway that senses nutrient and oxygen levels and may be beneficial for neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
