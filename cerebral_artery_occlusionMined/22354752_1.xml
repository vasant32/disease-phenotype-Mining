<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) is neuroprotective and significantly reduces neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether splenic signaling occurs through interferon gamma (IFNγ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFNγ was elevated early in spleens but later in the brains of rats following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy decreased the amount of IFNγ in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of recombinant IFNγ abolished the protective effects of splenectomy with a concurrent increase in INFγ expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for spleen-derived IFNγ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
