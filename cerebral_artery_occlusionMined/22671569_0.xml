<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the role of SHPS-1 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and brain damage induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and SHPS-1 mutant (MT) mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (60 min) followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SHPS-1 MT mice had significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurological function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, neural injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were inhibited in SHPS-1 MT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> genes nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 were up-regulated in SHPS-1 MT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SHPS-1 mutation suppressed the phosphorylation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first demonstration that SHPS-1 plays an important role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and brain injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of Akt signaling and the up-regulation of Nrf2 and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 likely account for the protective effects that were observed in the SHPS-1 MT mice </plain></SENT>
