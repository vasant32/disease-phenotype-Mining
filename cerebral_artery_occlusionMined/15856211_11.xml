<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the expression of alpha-BC in the rat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>alpha-BC transcript and protein were transiently expressed 4 h after MCAO/reperfusion in the pyramidal neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning 2 days after MCAO, significant alpha-BC induction appeared in reactive astrocytes in the penumbra, and this induction was sustained for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, levels of MAPKAPK-2, one of the alpha-BC upstream kinases, and its phosphorylated form were upregulated gradually and peaked 4 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical study indicated that alpha-BC was co-localized with MAPKAPK-2 and p-MAPKAPK-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p38beta MAPK, an upstream kinase of MAPKAPK-2, which has been known to be involved in compensatory responses to stress, was also co-localized with alpha-BC in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the p38beta-dependent alpha-BC induction in neurons and astrocytes in the penumbra may play an important role in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
