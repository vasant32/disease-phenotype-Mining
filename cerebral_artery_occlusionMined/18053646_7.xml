<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether intravenously transplanted MSCs alters expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fisher-344 rats were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental groups were: (I) vehicle group, with intravenous injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3h after MCAO; and (II) transplant group, with intravenous injection of MSCs (3x10(6)cells) 3h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function of rats was evaluated using modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and Rotor-rod Motor Test (RMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed on 1st, 3rd and 7th days of MCAO, and coronal brain sections were stained immunohistochemically to identify the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins, namely survivin and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells on 3rd day of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery according to mNSS and RMT was significantly better in the transplant group as compared with the vehicle group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant expression of survivin on 3rd day and Bcl-2 on 1st and 3rd days in the transplant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vehicle group displayed significantly more TUNEL-positive cells than the transplant group on 3rd day (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intravenous transplantation of MSCs prevents down-regulation of survivin and Bcl-2 preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ischemic brain leading to motor and sensory function recovery </plain></SENT>
