<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that baseline computed tomographic (CT) scans might be a useful tool for selecting particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who would benefit from thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether the baseline CT scan, assessed with the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), could identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who might particularly benefit from intra-arterial thrombolysis of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline and 24-hour follow-up CT scans of patients randomized within 6 hours of symptoms to intra-arterial thrombolysis with recombinant pro-urokinase or control in the PROACT-II study were retrospectively scored by using ASPECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into those with ASPECTS &gt;7 or &lt; or =7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent functional outcome at 90 days was compared between the 2 strata according to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 154 patients with angiographically confirmed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted risk ratio of an independent functional outcome, in favor of treatment, in the ASPECTS &gt;7 group was 5.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 19.2) compared with 1.0 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.9) in the ASPECTS &lt; or =7 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the risk ratio in the ASPECTS score &gt;7 was 3.2 (95% CI, 1.2 to 9.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar favorable treatment effects were observed when secondary outcomes were used, but these did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with a baseline ASPECTS &gt;7 were 3 times more likely to have an independent functional outcome with thrombolytic treatment compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a baseline ASPECTS &lt; or =7 were less likely to benefit from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that ASPECTS can be both a useful clinical tool and an important method of baseline risk stratification in future clinical trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
