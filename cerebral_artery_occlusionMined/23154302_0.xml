<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether combinatorial post-injury treatment with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (P4) and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> hormone (VDH) would reduce ischemic injury more effectively than P4 alone in an oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) model in primary cortical neurons and in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the OGD model, P4 and VDH each showed neuroprotection individually, but combination of the "best" doses did not show substantial efficacy; instead, the lower dose of VDH in combination with P4 was the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the tMCAO model, P4 and VDH were given alone or in combination at different times post-occlusion for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo data confirmed the in vitro findings and showed better <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction at day 7 and functional outcomes (at 3, 5 and 7 days post-occlusion) after combinatorial treatment than when either agent was given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VDH, but not P4, upregulated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1, suggesting a pathway for the neuroprotective effects of VDH differing from that of P4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of P4 and VDH activated brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its specific receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under specific conditions VDH potentiates P4's neuroprotective efficacy and should be considered as a potential partner of P4 in a low-cost, safe and effective combinatorial treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
