<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and predictors of SAH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated endovascularly and its impact on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with primary mechanical thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or both were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were reviewed to identify the presence of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed any decline in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 3 hours after intervention and in the outcomes at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were treated by primary thrombectomy with MERCI Retriever devices, whereas 31 were treated by primary intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients experienced SAH, 8 with pure SAH and 12 with coexisting parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAH was numerically more frequent with primary thrombectomy than in the intra-arterial thrombolysis groups (14.1% vs 6.5%, P = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of SAH were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 5.39, P = 0.035), distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (odds ratio = 3.53, P = 0.027), use of rescue angioplasty after thrombectomy (odds ratio = 12.49, P = 0.004), and procedure-related vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (odds ratio = 30.72, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive SAH or coexisting parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> tended to have more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> at 3 hours (28.6% vs 0%, P = 0.11), to be less independent at discharge (modified Rankin Scale â‰¤ 2; 0% vs 15.4%, P = 0.5), and to experience higher mortality during hospitalization (42.9% vs 15.4%, P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Procedure-related vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, rescue angioplasty after thrombectomy with MERCI devices, distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were independent predictors of SAH after endovascular therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only extensive SAH or SAH accompanied by severe parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> may worsen clinical outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
