<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An inflammatory insult following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) is associated with a predisposition to develop a deleterious <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to the brain antigen myelin basic protein (MBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction of immunologic tolerance to brain antigens prior to MCAO prevents this deleterious <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> and is associated with better functional outcome early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine the long term immunologic consequences of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and induction of mucosal tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats were tolerized to MBP or ovalbumin (OVA) by intranasal administration prior to MCAO and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was assessed at set points after MCAO and animals sacrificed at 3 months; the immune response to MBP in brain and spleen was determined using ELISPOT assay and degree of cellular inflammatory brain infiltrate assessed by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals that developed a pro-inflammatory (TH1) response to MBP experienced worse outcome, while those that developed a regulatory response (TREG) experienced better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A TREG response in spleen was also associated with decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and an increase in the number of FoxP3 positive cells in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, tolerization to MBP prior to MCAO was associated with a tendency to develop a TH1 response to MBP by 3 months after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that induction of immunological tolerance to MBP is associated with improved outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study, however, raises concern about the potential for inadvertent induction of detrimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> through mucosal administration of antigen </plain></SENT>
