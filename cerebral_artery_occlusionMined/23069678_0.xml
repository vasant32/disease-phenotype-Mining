<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is a key modulator of neuronal gene expression in several neurological conditions, we studied the possible involvement of REST in regulating NCX1 gene expression and activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that: (1) REST binds in a sequence specific manner and represses through H4 deacetylation, ncx1 gene in neuronal cells by recruting CoREST, but not mSin3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2)In neurons and in SH-SY5Y cells REST silencing by siRNA and site-direct mutagenesis of REST consensus sequence on NCX1 brain promoter determined an increase in NCX1 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3)By contrast, REST overexpression caused a reduction in NCX1 protein expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(4)Interestingly, in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) and in organotypic hippocampal slices or SH-SY5Y cells exposed to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) plus reoxygenation (RX), the increase in REST was associated with a decrease in NCX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this reduction was reverted by REST silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(5)REST knocking down, along with the deriving NCX1overexpression in the deep V and VIb cortical layers caused a marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double silencing of REST and NCX1 completely abolished neuroprotection induced by siREST administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results demonstrate that REST, by regulating NCX1 expression, may represent a potential druggable target for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
