<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the putative role and predictive significance of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> elevation in space-occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the correlation between perfusional disturbances and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> alterations in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> model in cats that is susceptible to secondary deterioration after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 10 halothane-anesthetized cats, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded for 3 hours, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probes, microdialysis/high-performance liquid chromatography, and pressure sensors measured simultaneously regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), extracellular amino acids, mean arterial blood pressure, and intracranial pressure, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In complementary experiments (n=2), regional CBF was assessed by sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced LDF-measured CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals to &lt;25% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 10 cats, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> rose approximately 30-fold during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDF-measured CBF and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> primarily recovered after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> rose again in the late reperfusion phase, when CPP decreased to &lt;60 mm Hg, and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography revealed ischemic thresholds of 15 to 20 mL/100 g per minute for secondary deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other 5 cats, ischemic elevation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was significantly smaller, and signs of secondary deterioration were not recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> determinations during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> predict fatal outcome, as do intracranial pressure and CPP measurements during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Secondary amino acid elevation during reperfusion is presumably caused by a drastic decrease of CPP to &lt;50 mm Hg in the final stage of space-occupying, malignant focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At this stage, a further progression of injury due to increased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> may be irrelevant with respect to fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
