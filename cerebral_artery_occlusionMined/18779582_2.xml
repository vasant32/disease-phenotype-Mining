<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a variety of therapeutic approaches have shown promise in small-animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the vast majority of clinical trials to test the efficacy of such modalities have failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To bridge the translational gap between laboratory and clinical research, we developed a preclinical model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a minimally invasive endovascular approach, a <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coil was intravascularly guided through the vertebrobasilar system under C-arm fluoroscopy to occlude the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The approach included femoral artery catheterization to access the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and therefore eliminated the occurrence of head trauma associated with other preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models relying on transorbital or craniectomy approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 h of focal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the coil was retrieved to cause reperfusion, which was verified by arteriograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, T2-weighted coronal magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images were acquired and processed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the brain and its vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infarction, limited to the area at risk, was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two independent observers calculated the mean percentage hemispherical lesion volumes as follows: observer 1, 30.9 +/- 2.1%; observer 2, 31.2 +/- 4.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath>-affected changes in histology were determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin as well as by Fluoro-Jade staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work reports the successful development of a powerful preclinical model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that lends itself to the study of biologic mechanisms as well as to testing experimental therapeutics </plain></SENT>
