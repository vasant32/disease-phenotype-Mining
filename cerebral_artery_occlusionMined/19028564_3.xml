<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a simple, robust and versatile approach for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52218">carbocyanine</z:chebi> triple fluorescence labelling of neuronal, vascular and glial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of this procedure is shown for rat brain tissue under physiological conditions, after traumatic brain injury caused by controlled cortical impact injury, and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the versatility of the method is verified by its application to sections from old triple transgenic mice with age-dependent beta-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus, modelling neuropathological alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To exemplify the usefulness of the approach for analysis of the enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, it was applied to whole mounts from the horse intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biotinylated lectin from potato (Solanum tuberosum) is presented as an excellent tool to detect both vessels and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this lectin revealed macrophages after experimental insults, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> in aged triple transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large portion of astroglia was demonstrated by immunolabelling of glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurons were detected by monoclonal antibodies directed against neuronal nuclei and, in horse tissues, mouse-anti-HuC/D recognizing a conserved nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser-scanning microscopy elucidated spatial relationships of the relevant markers and their pathological alterations after experimental insults and in transgenic mice with Alzheimer-like lesions </plain></SENT>
