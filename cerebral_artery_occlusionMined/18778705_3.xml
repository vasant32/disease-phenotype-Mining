<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Newborn neurons migrate to the injured striatum, but few survive long-term and little evidence exists to suggest that they integrate or contribute to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One potential strategy to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery is to stimulate neurogenesis and integration of adult-born neurons by using treatments that enhance neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA), which stimulates neonatal SVZ and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and environmental enrichment (EE), which enhances survival of adult-born hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the combination of RA and EE would promote survival of adult-generated SVZ-derived neurons and improve functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, received BrdU on days 5-11 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were treated with RA/EE, RA alone, EE/vehicle or vehicle alone and were killed 61 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent repeated MRI and behavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that RA/EE treatment preserved striatal and hemisphere tissue and increased SVZ neurogenesis as demonstrated by Ki67 and doublecortin (DCx) immunolabeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments influenced the location of BrdU- and DCx-positive cells in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RA/EE increased the number of BrdU/NeuN-positive cells in the injured striatum but did not lead to improvements in behavioral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral manipulation enhances post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> striatal neurogenesis and decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume without promoting detectable functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study of the integration of adult-born neurons in the ischemic striatum is necessary to determine their restorative potential </plain></SENT>
