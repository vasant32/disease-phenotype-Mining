<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (EP) is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> derivative that has been reported recently to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> in mice with established lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of EP in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 1 hour of MCAO, and EP was administered at various time points before or after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, neurological deficits, microglia activation, and proinflammatory cytokine expression were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BV2 microglial cells were also used to access the anti-inflammatory effect of EP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The administration of EP intraperitoneally at 30 minutes before or at 4 or 12 hours after MCAO reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 10.3+/-3.4% (n=6; P&lt;0.05), 21.5+/-2.7% (n=6; P&lt;0.05), and 44.3+/-4.0% (n=6; P&lt;0.05), respectively, of that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was accompanied by the suppression of the clinical manifestations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, including motor impairment and neurological deficits, microglial activation, and proinflammatory cytokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of EP was yet evident when it was administered as late as 24 hours after MCAO/reperfusion (76.5+/-4.70%; n=6; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EP suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> induced activation of BV2 cells, as was evidenced by a reduction in NO release and the accompanying induction of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that EP affords the strong protection of the delayed cerebral ischemic injury with a wide therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
