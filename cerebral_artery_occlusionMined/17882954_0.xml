<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study is to observe the effect of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) on neural cells damage and neurogenesis in sub-granular zone (SGZ) and sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A modified middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into four groups: sham control group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion group, Sal B 1 and 10 mg x kg(-1) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sal B was consecutively administrated once a day by ip injection after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurogenesis in SGZ and SVZ was investigated by BrdU method 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Nissl staining for neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and cerebral cortex was performed 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A beam-walking test was used to monitor the motor function recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> resulted in an increase of BrdU positive cells both in ipsilateral SGZ and SVZ at 7th day after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sal B (10 mg x kg(-1)) significantly increased further the number of BrdU positive cells both in SGZ and SVZ (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral hippocampal neuron damage occurred and CA1 almost lost 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sal B (10 mg x kg(-1)) obviously attenuated the neuron damage and increased the number of neuron both in ipsilateral CA1 and cerebral cortex (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also observed an obvious improvement of motor function recovery when Sal B (10 mg x kg(-1)) administrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the results above we concluded that Sal B stimulated neurogenesis process both in SGZ and SVZ after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and also alleviated neural cells loss and improved motor function recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
