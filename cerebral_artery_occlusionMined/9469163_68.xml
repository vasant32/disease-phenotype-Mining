<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a closed cranial window over the parietal cortex, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border using online in vivo chemiluminescence (CL) while monitoring the appearance of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The borderzone localization of the ROS and direct current (DC) potential measurements was confirmed in additional experiments using laser-Doppler scanning, mapping regional CBF changes through the cranial window after permanent (n = 5) or reversible (n = 5) MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CL measurements revealed a short period (10 to 30 minutes) of reduced ROS formation after vessel occlusion, followed by a significant increase (to 162 +/- 51%; baseline = 100%; P &lt; .05) from 100 minutes of permanent MCAO onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion after a 1-hour period of MCAO led to a burst-like pattern of ROS production (peak: 489 +/- 330%; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the experiments were terminated 3 hours after induction of MCAO, CL was still significantly increased above baseline after permanent and reversible MCAO (to 190 +/- 67% and 211 +/- 64%, respectively; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous DC potential recordings detected 6.4 +/- 2.7 PID in the first, 4.7 +/- 2.3 in the second, and 2.8 +/- 2.0 in the third hour after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals with reversible MCAO, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> were abolished from 15-minutes recirculation onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no temporal relationship between ROS production and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> DC potential shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using a high temporal resolution ROS detection technique (CL), we found that permanent MCAO (after an initial decrease) was accompanied by a steady increase of ROS production during the 3-hour observation period, while reperfusion after 1 hour of MCAO produced a burst in ROS formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patterns of ROS production were not related to the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
