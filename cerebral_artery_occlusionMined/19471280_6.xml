<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined if the sex difference in blood flow during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is linked to sEH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase expression in brain, hydrolase activity in cerebral vessels, and plasma 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET) were determined in male and female <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and sEH knockout (sEHKO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male, female, and ovariectomized female WT and sEHKO mice were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured at 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler cortical perfusion during MCAO was compared among groups and differences in cortical blood flow rates were confirmed using in vivo quantitative optical microangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular expression and activity of sEH and plasma 14,15-DHET were lower in WT female than male mice, and blood flow during MCAO was higher and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was smaller in WT female compared with male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sex differences in cerebral blood flow and ischemic damage were abolished after ovariectomy and were absent in sEHKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that sEH is an important mechanism underlying sex-linked differences in blood flow and brain damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
