<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both Bcl genes were under the control of the same mouse Thy-1 regulatory sequences resulting in very similar expression patterns in cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these sequences direct <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>lateonset</z:hpo> (i.e. around birth) expression in brain, thus minimizing effects of transgene expression during brain development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured using MRI after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared to their non-transgenic littermates, Thy1mbcl-XL mice showed a significant 21% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size whereas Thy1hbcl-2 mice did not reveal any reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a selective protective advantage of Bcl-XL as compared with Bcl-2 in this mouse model for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
