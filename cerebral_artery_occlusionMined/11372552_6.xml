<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is the development of a liposomal drug delivery system that maintains effective concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> fasudil in the CSF, resulting in neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated rats received 0.25 mg liposome-entrapped fasudil via the cisterna magna 2 hours after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control rats received drug-free liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological condition and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were assessed at 24 and 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of liposome-entrapped fasudil in the CSF was measured before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treated animals showed significantly improved neurological outcomes after the 24-hour observation period compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 0.25 mg liposomal fasudil resulted in a reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area (24 hours: 29.0 +/- 4.4%, 72 hours: 28.1 +/- 3.9% of total brain slices) compared to controls (49.6 +/- 4.6%, p &lt; 0.001), but there was no statistical difference between 24 and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours post-administration, CSF concentrations of liposome-entrapped fasudil were 45.4 +/- 31.5 micrograms/ml (20% of the injected dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A single intrathecal injection of liposomal fasudil can maintain a therapeutic drug concentration in the CSF over a period of time, significantly decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
