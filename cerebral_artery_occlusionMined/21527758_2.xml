<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV tPA) frequently fails to recanalize proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M1) obstructions, preventing favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only neurointerventional procedures prevail in these cases, but well-equipped centers remain scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new therapeutic strategy consisting of a second IV thrombolysis with low-dose tenecteplase was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M1 occlusion that did not reopen at the end of IV tPA perfusion received IV tenecteplase (0.1 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> recanalization (Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 2/3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were assessed by magnetic resonance aging approximately 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes at 3 months were evaluated with the modified Rankin score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 40 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M1 occlusions who received IV tPA, 13 were treated according to the protocol of sequential combined IV thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a mean of 16.8 hours after IV thrombolysis, the recanalization rate was 100% (2 with Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 2, 11 with Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 4 of 13 (31%) patients, with no symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin score = 0/1) were achieved in 9 of 13 (69%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes were very similar to those of 13 patients with early IV-tPA recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 4 patients treated as protocol violations, 1 presented with a lack of recanalization and a parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M1 occlusions treated with IV tPA but without early recanalization, a second bolus of IV tenecteplase (0.1 mg/kg) may be a relatively safe, effective, and easy option in carefully selected cases, but additional studies are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
