<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of NMDARs subunits decreases Ca(2+) influxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NR3, a novel subunit of NMDARs, also decreases Ca(2+) influxes by forming new NMDARs with NR1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51146">NR2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is meaningful to uncover whether protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and NR3A play a role in the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> for 7 days before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed to mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> decreased brain ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area significantly while increasing the expression levels of PP2A and NR3A, thus dephosphorylating the serine sites of NR1 (ser896 and ser897) along with increased enzymatic activities of PP2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of NR3A decreased as the enzymatic activities of PP2A were inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> could protect the cerebrum from ischemic injury through a signaling mechanism involving elevated levels of PP2A and NR3A, and that PP2A might involve in the regulatory mechanism of NR3A expression </plain></SENT>
