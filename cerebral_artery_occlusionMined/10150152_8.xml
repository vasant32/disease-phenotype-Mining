<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was organized to gather preliminary data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of TCD when compared to cerebral angiography in detecting stenosing lesions and collateral flow patterns of the anterior cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients from six medical centers were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each received cerebral angiography and TCD testing within 24 hours of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on TCD criteria established a priori, the results were first analyzed by a blinded investigator and then by computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized analyses were then repeated with modified criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow through the anterior communicating and ophthalmic arteries was detected with sensitivities of 62% and 100%, and specificities of 98% and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery proximal and distal severe ( greater than 70%) stenoses were detected with sensitivities of 79% and 100% and specificities of 88% and 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Middle and anterior cerebral artery stenoses and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were detected with specificities exceeding 98%; however, the data were insufficient to determine sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computerized analyses did not permit improvement of sensitivity and specificity of the baseline criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The selected TCD criteria are highly specific in detecting intracranial stenoses and collateral flow patterns of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The criteria have limited but acceptable sensitivity and specificity in detecting internal carotid artery origin severe stenoses, and are highly sensitive in detecting ophthalmic artery retrograde flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A study with a larger sample is necessary to provide definitive guidelines for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
