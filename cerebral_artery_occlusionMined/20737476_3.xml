<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi>) in a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose used, intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 14.3% ± 7.4% that of untreated controls and afforded a reduction in motor impairment and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects were not reproduced by other <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> or acetylated-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> suppressed postischemic microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced upregulation of proinflammatory mediators both in vivo and in culture systems using microglial or macrophage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> were mainly attributable to its ability to inhibit nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of p65 to both NF-κB consensus sequence and NF-κB binding sequence of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> strongly repressed p65 transactivation in BV2 cells using Gal4-p65 chimeras system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P65 displayed increased O-GlcNAcylation in response to LPS; this effect was also reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LPS-induced increase in p65 O-GlcNAcylation was paralleled by an increase in interaction with O-GlcNAc transferase, which was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> or its derivatives may serve as novel neuroprotective or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
