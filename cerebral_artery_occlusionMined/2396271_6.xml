<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We divided the rats into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group (n = 8) neither hematocrit nor blood pressure was manipulated during occlusion, in the hemodilution group (n = 8) 5% albumin was administered to maintain a hematocrit of 30% during occlusion, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group (n = 8) mean arterial blood pressure was increased to 30 mm Hg above baseline during occlusion with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, and in the hemodilution/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group (n = 8) albumin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> were employed simultaneously during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (as concentration of extravasated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) spectrophotometrically and the extent of ischemic injury (as percentage of the hemisphere with deficient staining) histochemically using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion in the hemodilution/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group (71 +/- 14 micrograms/g brain tissue) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than that in the hemodilution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> groups (25 +/- 5 and 29 +/- 7 micrograms/g, respectively), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in these two groups were in turn significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than that in the control group (2 +/- 3 micrograms/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere with deficient staining was significantly (p less than 0.05) less in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hemodilution <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> groups (8 +/- 3% and 11 +/- 6%, respectively) than in the control and hemodilution groups (26 +/- 8% and 26 +/- 7%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
