<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice genetically targeted for the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-forming vascular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase subunit, NOX1, have a blunted hypertensive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesised that NOX1 is mechanistically involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production by cerebral arteries, and potentially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> production by cerebral arteries and brains from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and NOX1 deficient (NOX1-KO) mice was measured using L-012-enhanced chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; 0.5 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured using transcranial laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, neurological assessment was performed, mice were euthanised, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volumes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> was similar between WT and NOX1-KO in brain and cerebral artery homogenates, and in intact cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-stimulated increases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> were approximately 70% smaller in rings from NOX1-KO versus WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During MCAO, rCBF decreased by approximately 75% in both WT and NOX1-KO, and increased to similar levels in each strain immediately following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in neurological score, total or subcortical cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume was observed between WT and NOX1-KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (which was very modest in WT) was approximately 4-fold greater in brains of NOX1-KO versus WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, NOX1 is essential for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in large cerebral arteries in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> but not under basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NOX1 does not appear to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> size, and it may limit cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
