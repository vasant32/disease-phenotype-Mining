<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to evaluate the effect of bilateral MCAO in naive and strategies-pretrained rats using a detailed behavioral analysis to further develop a water maze model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were trained in either a simple swim-to-visible platform task or in a conventional spatial version with a hidden platform in the pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the visible platform task naive stroked rats were impaired because of a marked tendency to swim thigmotaxically on most trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the spatial learning experiment, some rats received Morris' water maze strategies pretraining prior to MCAO and subsequent spatial training to familiarize them with the general behavioral strategies required in the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the spatial learning task naive stroked rats had both strategies and spatial learning impairments but pretrained stroked rats were indistinguishable from sham controls on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> behavioral measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stroked rats had comparable bilateral brain damage measured using a computerized volumetric measuring technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in naive rats bilateral MCAO causes behavioral strategies impairments in the visible and hidden platform versions of the water maze as well as specific spatial learning impairments in the hidden platform version </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results also indicate that behavioral strategies pretraining allows stroked rats to acquire and remember sufficient strategies skills and spatial information to perform as well as sham controls during subsequent spatial training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These techniques appear to be capable of quantifying the effects of potentially protective treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
