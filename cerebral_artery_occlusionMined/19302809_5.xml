<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the neurochemical effects of this intervention on the ischemic brain have not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pre-ischemic treadmill training on the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) from the striatum in a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: sham control without MCAO, and 0, 1, 2 and 4 weeks pre-ischemic treadmill training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After training, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by MCAO for 120 min, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis was used to collect dialysates from the striatum immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and at 40, 80 and 120 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as well as at 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 and 240 min after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Pre-ischemic treadmill training decreased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> release during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treadmill training for at least 2 weeks produced statistically significant changes in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The present study suggests that treadmill training inhibits the excessive release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, by stimulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> release during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be one of the important mechanisms to protect the striatal neurons from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
