<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors evaluated the efficacy of emergency embolectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of the charts for patients undergoing embolectomy at the authors' institution was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between October 1997 and May 2004, 12 patients (mean age 70 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MCAO were treated using embolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local intraarterial fibrinolysis with urokinase was initially undertaken in eight of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sufficient recanalization was not achieved with fibrinolysis in any patient, and thus embolectomy was performed immediately thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization by embolectomy was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (mean occlusion time 6 hours, 11 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient's condition was evaluated on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes in the 12 patients according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale were good recovery in five, moderate disability in two, severe disability in three, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to a cardiac complication in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the 12 patients had symptomatic hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emergency embolectomy can be performed in patients with MCAO with minimal morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure can be used to achieve good recovery even in patients in whom fibrinolysis is insufficient after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MCAO and should be a part of the algorithm for the treatment of MCAO </plain></SENT>
