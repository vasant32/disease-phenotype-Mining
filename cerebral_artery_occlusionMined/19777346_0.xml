<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One DAHK dose (16 mg/kg) or saline solution were i.v. administered 30 min after occlusion and neurological deficit was evaluated at 2, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h using Longa scoring scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The striatum infarction area was evaluated until 96 h after occlusion in both groups after staining with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DAHK-treated group showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) protection of 70% of neurological deficit at 96 h after occlusion, in comparison with the control-group that showed permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DAHK-treated group showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction of 52% infarction area in the striatum, as compared to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results presented here support the possible therapeutic application of DAHK as a neuroprotective agent in human patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is part of human serum albumin, already being tested in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
