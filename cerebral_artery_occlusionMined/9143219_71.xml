<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mutant ICE mice (n = 11) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates (n = 9) were subjected to 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were reduced by 44% and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were also significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF, blood pressure, core temperature, and heart rate did not differ between groups when measured for up to 1 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in immunoreactive IL-1 beta levels, observed in ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> brain at 30 min after reperfusion, were 77% lower in the mutant strain, indicating that proIL-1 beta cleavage is inhibited in the mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was reduced in the mutants 6 and 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, endogenous expression of an ICE inhibitor confers resistance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that downregulation of ICE expression might provide a useful therapeutic target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
