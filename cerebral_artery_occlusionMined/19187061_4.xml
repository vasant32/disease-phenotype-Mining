<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Previous studies on the therapeutic time window for intravascular administration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have shown that early intervention (from 3 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rat model is the most effective approach to reduce ischaemic lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed these observations but noticed that 2 weeks after transplantation, almost none of the grafted BMSCs could be detected in or around the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present experiments aimed to assess the fate and kinetics of intravascularly injected BMSCs shortly after administration in correlation to the development of the ischaemic lesion after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We administered a syngeneic suspension of complete (haematopoietic and mesenchymal) BMSCs via the carotid artery to rats at 2 h after MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the distribution and tissue location of BMSCs within the first 24 h after arterial administration by perfusion-fixating rats and performing immunohistochemical analysis at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The vast majority (&gt;95%) of BMSCs appeared to become trapped in the spleen shortly after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six hours after implantation, together with the appearance of activated microglia, the first BMSCs could be detected in and around the lesion; their number gradually increased during the first 12 h after implantation but started to decrease at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The implanted BMSCs were surrounded by activated and phagocytotic microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that ischaemic lesion size reduction can already be achieved by the early transient presence at the lesion site of intravascularly implanted BMSCs, possibly mediated via activated microglia </plain></SENT>
