<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the magnitude of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction generally increases with time, which could reflect increased severity of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, a threshold in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction may exist beyond which damage can not be reversed with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine if such a threshold exists that is independent of the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to either 30, 60, or 90 min of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps acquired just before and 30 min after reperfusion were compared to histology performed after a 72 h survival period to determine the relationship between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction and final ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant variability in tissue recovery was observed for the 30 min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reductions of up to 45% often recovered, while some regions not exhibiting any change in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> during occlusion showed ischemic injury at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were made in cortical regions of the 60 min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the caudate-putamen, reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was often associated with ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the 90 min group, results for the caudate-putamen were similar to those for the 60 min group, while reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was a much better predictor of final ischemic injury in cortical regions than it was in both the 30 and 60 min groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, no single threshold of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction that was independent of the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was associated with irreversible injury </plain></SENT>
