<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine- to 10-week-old male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by the monofilament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry with an avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex-alkaline phosphatase and/or -peroxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain sections processed with double-immunofluorescent staining were further scanned by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interspersed among the predominantly newly formed glial cells, some cells were double labeled by BrdU and 1 of the neuron-specific markers, Map-2, beta-tubulin III, and Neu N, at 30 and 60 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells were randomly distributed throughout cortical layers II through VI, occurring with highest density in the ischemic boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional confocal analyses of BrdU and the neuron-specific marker Neu N confirmed their colocalization within the same cortical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that new neurons can be generated in the cerebral cortex of adult rats after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical neurogenesis may be a potential pathway for brain repair after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
