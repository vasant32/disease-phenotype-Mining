<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enriched housing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-injured rats provides multi-modal sensorimotor stimulation, which improves recovery, although the specific mechanisms involved have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rats housed in an enriched environment for two weeks after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we found increased sigma-1 receptor expression in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of rats subjected to permanent or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi> dihydrochloride, an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of the sigma-1 receptor, starting two days after injury, enhanced the recovery of lost sensorimotor function without decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sigma-1 receptor was found in the galactocerebroside enriched membrane microdomains of reactive astrocytes and in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sigma-1 receptor activation increased the levels of the synaptic protein neurabin and neurexin in membrane rafts in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, while sigma-1 receptor silencing prevented sigma-1 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In astrocytic cultures, oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation induced sigma-1 receptor expression and actin dependent membrane raft formation, the latter blocked by sigma-1 receptor small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing and pharmacological inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that sigma-1 receptor activation stimulates recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by enhancing cellular transport of biomolecules required for brain repair, thereby stimulating brain plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological targeting of the sigma-1 receptor provides new opportunities for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment beyond the therapeutic window of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
