<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) can be used a biochemical marker for assessing neuronal viability/integrity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this view has recently been questioned based on observations showing that after a photothrombotic permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decline of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> in the infracted regions, where massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> persists, is reversible over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the longitudinal changes of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) in ischemic rat brain after a 15-min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by in vivo (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the levels of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and total Cr in the ischemic lesion decrease significantly at 1 day post-ichemia, followed by spontaneous recovery to the control levels by 2 weeks and remained stable thereafter up to 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The normalization of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and total Cr levels was associated histologically with persisted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> up to 90 % in the ischemic core, and accompanied by marked reactive astrocytic responses occurring with a similar time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute T(2) relaxation time in the ischemic lesion increased during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, and declined afterwards during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases of 15-min MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The delayed decreases of T(2) in the ischemic lesion might be associated with deposition of paramagnetic species, such as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> and iron originated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, vascular degradation and/or hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study give further support to the hypothesis that the recovery of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> might have contributions from reactive glia cells, and caution the use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> as a specific neuronal marker during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
