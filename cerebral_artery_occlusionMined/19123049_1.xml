<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found increased phosphorylation of Rb and translocation from neuronal nucleus to cytoplasm in the penumbra zone at 12 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)/reperfusion, compared with sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 12 h and 1 day, phospho-Rb appeared to be colocalizated with TUNEL staining in neurons, but staining was not colocalizated at 3 days and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that cytoplasmic translocation of phospho-Rb from nucleus of neurons occurs in potential apoptotic neurons in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, suggesting that the Rb pathway may only be involved in early neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and may be not an apoptotic signal in the late stages of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
