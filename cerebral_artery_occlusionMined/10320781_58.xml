<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time course of post-ischemic astroglial dysfunction and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was studied in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) brain following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labeled riboprobes for GFAP and GLUT3 was used to monitor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in glia and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Astrocytic proteins GFAP, vimentin, S100, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi>-S-Transferase Yb (GST Yb) and neuronal protein TG2 were detected by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were co-stained with in situ end labeling (ISEL) to detect DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression declined rapidly in the ischemic region of the cortex and was almost absent by 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies revealed a parallel decline in the corresponding protein: a reduction in GFAP staining was apparent in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after 3 h and by 24 h, there was essentially no remaining GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three other glial proteins (vimentin, S100 and GST Yb) disappeared from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> over a similar time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A few ISEL positive cells were observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 6 h, but maximal detection was not seen until 24-48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the ISEL-positive cells were neurons, identified by co-staining with the neuronal marker TG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Few cells expressing GFAP or other glial markers were positive at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuronal GLUT3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> declined more slowly than GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the ischemic core and disappeared during the period of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concurrent with the loss of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, there was a rapid rise in GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of ipsilateral hemisphere and proximal region of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was followed by the enhanced GFAP protein expression characteristic of reactive astrocytes, but over a significantly slower time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These studies show that MCAO leads to a rapid decline of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and glial proteins, which appears to precede the decline in neuronal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early astroglial dysfunction may play a critical role in determining the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoxic-ischemic injury by compromising neuronal-glial interactions </plain></SENT>
