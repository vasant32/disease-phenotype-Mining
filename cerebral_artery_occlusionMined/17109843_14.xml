<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both classes of agent have high selectivity toward mGlu sub-types and are active in animal models of various diseases indicating satisfactory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In organotypic hippocampal cultures MPEP showed high neuroprotective potency against sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (12 days) insult produced by 3-NP with an IC50 of c.a </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, although the mGlu1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> EMQMCM was also protective, it seems to be weaker yielding an IC50 of c.a </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTEP, at 2.5 mg/kg and at 5 mg/kg provided 50 and 70% neuroprotection if injected 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
