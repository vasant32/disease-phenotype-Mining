<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the neuroprotective properties have been attributed to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthases (NOS) and cyclooxygenases (COX) are considered to have a significant role in the inflammatory milieu occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While previous reports have shown that pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model can modulate NOS isoforms, the effect of post-treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> on l-arginine metabolism has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study initially examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (1 nm-1 mm) on l-arginine metabolism pathways in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> fibroblasts (HT-1080) fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence of neuroprotection with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was evaluated in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with three daily doses of 5 mg/kg i.p., starting 1 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Constitutive NOS activity but not expression was significantly increased by in vitro exposure (72 hr) to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment increased arginase activity by increasing arginase II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies showed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment after MCAO significantly inhibited inducible NOS activity and attenuated expression of the inducible isoform, resulting in decreased total NOS activity and tissue <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COX activity was significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective anti-inflammatory effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> were consistent with the substantial reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume throughout the cortex and striatum and recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The evidence presented here suggests that modulation of l-arginine metabolism by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> make it a valuable neuroprotective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
