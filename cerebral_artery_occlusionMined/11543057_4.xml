<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and photosensitizer induced intracranial infarction model of rat were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The geometric shape and infarction area were measured by NCT, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and TTC stained anatomical imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In photosensitizer induced infarction model, the correlation between anatomical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and NCT image area for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> focus were r = 0.897 for 24 h group (P &lt; 0.05) and r = 0.906 for 2 months group (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between anatomical infarction area and NCT image area for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> focus were r = 0.820 for normothermia group (P &lt; 0.05) and r = 0.851 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group (P &lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between fMRI and NCT image area for infarction focus were r = 0.874 for normothermia group (P &lt; 0.05) and r = 0.782 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement with NCT for infarction focus matched well with fMRI and anatomic sample in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NCT technique might be a practical tool for short-term prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the rehabilitation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in real time </plain></SENT>
