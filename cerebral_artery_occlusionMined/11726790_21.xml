<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that mice expressing reduced levels of Dnmt1 are protected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used the cre/loxP system to produce conditional mutants that lack Dnmt 1 in postmitotic neurons of the postnatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that animals heterozygous for the conditional allele (Dnmt11lox/+) have significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> following 1 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> litters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, mice with a deletion of Dnmt1 in post-mitotic neurons (Dnmt11lox/c) were not protected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrate that reduced levels of Dnmt1, but not its absence, in post-mitotic neurons protect from ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
