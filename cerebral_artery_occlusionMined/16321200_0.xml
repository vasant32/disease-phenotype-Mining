<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the results of 86 patients, 39 males and 47 females, aged 49.8 (13 - 72), 67 suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and 19 from traumatic carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, who received BOT, and on the results of 38 of the 66 patients who accepted <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after the BOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive rate of diagnosis was 10.47% and the negative rate was 89.53% by conventional BOT; whereas the positive rate of diagnosis was 36.05% and the negative rate was 63.95% with combined cross circulation and conventional test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> rate after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> therapy was 8.33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BOT-related complication rate was 3.49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1) The current BOT technique can basically provide reliable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) The cross circulation test and hypotensive provocative test can effectively improve the specificity of BOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) More perfect BOT criterion for the prediction of cerebral tolerance is still to be worked out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination of the conventional method and advanced imaging technique and search for an objective and quantificational criterion would be of reward </plain></SENT>
