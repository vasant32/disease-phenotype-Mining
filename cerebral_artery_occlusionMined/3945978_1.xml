<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF and SEP were restored at doses of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> of 20 and 30 gamma, with an increase of mean systemic arterial pressure 5 to 15 mm Hg and similar results were obtained at doses of 25 gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery of SEP was slight at extremely high doses of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (65 gamma), despite a definite increase of mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) and CBF </plain></SENT>
