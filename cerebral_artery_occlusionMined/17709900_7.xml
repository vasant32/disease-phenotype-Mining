<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we evaluated the effects of the intravenous infusion of IGF-1 on both <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> induced diabetic animals before and/or following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume was used as an index of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and the sensorimotor cortex (layers 5 and 6) as well as the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> using TUNEL staining and Caspase-3 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large lesion volume was produced in diabetic animals after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic animals also had an elevated basal level of apoptotic cells that are bilaterally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was further increased over basal after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of IGF-1 30-min before or 2 h after MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion decreased the lesion volume as well as the number of apoptotic cells in the cortical penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> as assessed by TUNEL and caspase-3 immunoreactivity was decreased in select sensorimotor cortex and hippocampal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that treatment with IGF-1 before or after ischemic insult significantly decreases both lesion volume and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in selected areas of the cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
