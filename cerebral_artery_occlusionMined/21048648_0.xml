<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study took place in the Pharmacology Research Laboratory at Guangxi Medical University, China, between March and May 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and forty rats were randomly divided into I/R group, sham-operated group, high-, medium-, and low-dose of YLS <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> groups, and nimodipine (Nim) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were intragastrically administered with drugs for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An operation was performed to induce an MCAO model in the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was started after 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influences of YLS <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> on the neurological score, the brain water content, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, the activities of super <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), the contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), the expressions of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissue were investigated; the morphological changes of rat cerebral cortical neurons were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the I/R group, YLS <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> reduced the neurological score, the brain water content, the infract volume, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO contents, the NOS activity, and the expression of Bax, and increased SOD activity, and the expression of Bcl-2 in the brain tissue, and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The YLS <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> has a protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/ reperfusion injury; the mechanism may be related to attenuating free radicals, and increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio </plain></SENT>
