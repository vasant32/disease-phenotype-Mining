<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> channels, K+ channels, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/H+ exchanger, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>,K+-ATPase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-ATPase, and five enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEA0400, unlike KB-R7943, did not inhibit the store-operated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry in cultured astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEA0400 attenuated dose- dependently paradoxical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> challenge-induced production of reactive oxygen species, DNA ladder formation, and nuclear condensation in cultured astrocytes, whereas it did not affect thapsigargin-induced cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of SEA0400 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes after a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rat cerebral cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
