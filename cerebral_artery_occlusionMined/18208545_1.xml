<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the role of a novel SERM, LY362321, in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomised and began receiving daily s.c. injections of either 1 mg/kg (n = 13), 10 mg/kg (n = 14) of LY362321, or vehicle (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was temporarily occluded (90 min), with cortical blood flow monitoring, at 12 days post ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor function was assessed using a neurological score prior to the MCAO and daily for 3 days following the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue was processed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume assessment using 2,3,5-triphenyltetra-zolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that there were no significant differences amongst groups in cortical blood flow during the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size amongst vehicle, 1, and 10 mg/kg treated animals: 22.9 +/- 5.0, 16.7 +/- 4.2, and 21.1 +/- 4.1, respectively, one-way anova [F(2,32) = 0.542, P = 0.587] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MCAO induced a significant decline in neurological score in the vehicle group (from 14 to 7 at 24 h post-MCAO) but this was not significantly affected by LY362321 at either dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pretreatment with a low or high dose of the novel SERM LY362321 did not significantly influence cerebral blood flow, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, or sensorimotor function in rats exposed to transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
