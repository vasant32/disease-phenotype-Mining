<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This current study aimed to investigate the nature of brain penetration of TSA using several in vitro and in vivo models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The uptake and efflux of TSA in primary rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVECs) were altered in the presence of a PgP inhibitor or multidrug-resistance-associated protein (Mrp1/2) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A polarized transport of TSA was found in RBMVEC monolayers with facilitated efflux from the abluminal to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polarized transport of TSA was attenuated by PgP or Mrp1/2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an in situ rat brain perfusion model, TSA crossed the blood-brain barrier at a greater rate than that for <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, and the brain penetration was increased in the presence of a PgP or Mrp1/2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain levels of TSA were only about 31% of that in the plasma and it increased to 74-77% of plasma levels when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> was coadministered in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The entry of TSA to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) significantly increased in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The normalized brain penetration of TSA in mdr1a((-/-)) mice was much higher than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken collectively, these findings provide evidence that TSA has limited brain penetration through the blood-brain barrier owing to the contribution of PgP and possibly Mrp1/2 </plain></SENT>
