<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of these dual actions on vessels and neurons, we were interested whether VEGF promotes long distance axonal plasticity in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show that VEGF promotes neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery in mice when delivered in a delayed way starting 3 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using anterograde tract-tracing experiments that we combined with histochemical and molecular biological studies, we demonstrate that although VEGF promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> predominantly in the ischemic hemisphere, pronounced axonal sprouting was induced by VEGF in the contralesional, but not the ipsilesional corticobulbar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corticobulbar plasticity was accompanied by the deactivation of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 in the lesioned hemisphere and the transient downregulation of the axonal growth inhibitors NG2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> and brevican and the guidance molecules ephrin B1/2 in the contralesional hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regulation of matrix proteinases, growth inhibitors, and guidance molecules offers insights how brain plasticity is controlled in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
