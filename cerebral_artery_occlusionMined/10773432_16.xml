<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of JNK-1 is strictly regulated, and only the phosphorylated form of JNK (phospho-JNK) which is translocated to the nucleus has an ability to activate c-Jun response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a protein which inhibits JNK-1 activation, and known as JNK interacting protein-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIP</z:e>-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated change in JNK-1, phospho-JNK, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIP</z:e>-1 immunoreactivity in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive JNK-1 was scant in the sham-control brain, but it was induced at 1 h after reperfusion, which was slightly increased at 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, phospho-JNK remained negative till 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 8 h, JNK-1 and phospho-JNK became distinctly positive, and nuclei as well as cytoplasm were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, immunoreactivity for JNK-1 and phospho-JNK became furthermore dense, and most neurons revealed positively stained nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIP</z:e>-1 remained negative till 8 h of reperfusion, but at 24 and 72 h, cytoplasm of cortical neurons at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> boundary area was positively stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIP</z:e>-1 induction got behind the JNK-1 activation, and therefore, may be a vain effort for neurons to survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of JNK-1 activation might become an innovative means of therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment in the future </plain></SENT>
