<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We determined long-term functional outcome in a well-characterized mouse model of mild focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We subjected 129/SV mice to sham operation or 30 minutes of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by reperfusion (89% survival rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six weeks later, animals were tested for neurological deficits, motor coordination on an accelerating Rota-rod apparatus, and spatial navigation in a water maze task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain lesion size was determined on NeuN-immunostained coronal brain sections by computer-assisted volumetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice had mild but distinct neurological deficits and no deficits in Rota-rod coordination or swimming speed 6 weeks after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mice had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spatial learning abilities in the place task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mice had deficits in the probe trial and visible platform task, which correlated with striatal lesion size determined on NeuN-immunostained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mice recover with mild neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mice have no obvious deficits in spatial learning in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> but display distinct deficits related to strategy switching and relearning </plain></SENT>
