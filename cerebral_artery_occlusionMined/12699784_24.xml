<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (1 h) was produced by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the expression patterns of caspase-12, Bip/GRP78, an ER-resident molecular chaperone whose expression serves as a good marker of ER stress, and caspase-7 by Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-fluorescent staining of caspase-12 immunohistochemistry and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method was performed to clarify the involvement of caspase-12 in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that ER stress was induced during reperfusion in our model, as witnessed by up-regulated Bip/GRP78 expression in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that caspase-12 activation occurred at 5-23 h of reperfusion, and immunoreactivity for caspase-12 was enhanced mainly in striatal neurons on the ischemic side at the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found the co-localization of caspase-12 immunoreactivity and DNA fragmentation detectable by the TUNEL method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not detect the presence of caspase-7 in the ER fraction at the period of caspase-12 cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results imply that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion induces ER stress and that caspase-12 activation concurred with ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caspase-12 seems to be involved in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caspase-7 is not likely to contribute to the cleavage of caspase-12 in our experimental model </plain></SENT>
