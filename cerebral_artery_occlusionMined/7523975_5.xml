<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At this stage it is suggested that it reflects hypoperfusion rather than failure of respiratory chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immersion of brain slices in TTC solution is preferable in comparison to perfusion with TTC in order to ensure, that enough TTC enters the post-occlusion tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared immersion technique versus perfusion technique 6 h after permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in 18 baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we assessed the function of the respiratory chain enzymes of stained and unstained tissue in three baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immersion technique revealed an absence of TTC staining limited to subcortical structures in two animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In seven experiments TTC indicated involvement of almost the entire <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of the ischaemic lesion indicated by the perfusion technique was very similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples from the presumed infarcted areas revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that perfusion and immersion technique do not cause significant different ischaemic delineation 6 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TTC staining appears to be a reliable method of evaluating volume of infarction in primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, absence of TTC staining 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is caused by energy or oxygen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> rather than by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
