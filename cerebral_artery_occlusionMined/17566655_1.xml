<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of HbV for improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related symptoms induced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion/reperfusion and an intra-internal carotid arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When HbV (10 mL/kg, i.v.) was administered to rats immediately after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, it reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of the cortex and total of the cortex plus sub-cortex significantly as compared with saline as a vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In AA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, HbV (10 mL/kg, i.v.) improved the motor dysfunction score and inhibited the increase in cerebral water content suggesting it could suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that HbV would provide a novel beneficial option for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
