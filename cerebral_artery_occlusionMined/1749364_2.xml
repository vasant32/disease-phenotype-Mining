<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The metabolic characteristics of the penumbral region were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats one hour after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on this region was examined by providing a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load prior to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The depressed concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> and elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in the penumbral region were similar to those found in the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purported neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the penumbral region was not reflected in an increased high-energy phosphate level in the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rapid deterioration of the metabolic status of this region in this strain of rat suggests that the increased consistency of infarction may come at the expense of the penumbral region, and thus this model may not be well suited for the study of metabolic changes and perhaps even therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
