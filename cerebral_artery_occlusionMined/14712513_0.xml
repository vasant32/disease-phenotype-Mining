<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and followed by 3 d reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drugs were orally administered 1 h before MCAO and 4 h after reperfusion and the following 2 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological scores were evaluated 3 d after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the animals were sacrificed, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, right and left areas of brain section, the pathologic changes and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurons in hippocampal CA1 and cortex were determined by using an image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content in brain tissue were evaluated by spectrophotography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> R1 subunit (NR1) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) was determined by immunoblotting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Serial "Huoxuehuayu" prescriptions and nimodipine improved neuronal dysfunction, and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial Huoxuehuayu prescriptions and nimodipine reduced <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content and NOS activity, and increased SOD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blotting analysis demonstrated induction of NR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serial Huoxuehuayu prescriptions have a protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury by reducing NOS activity, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, expression of NR1 and increasing SOD activity </plain></SENT>
