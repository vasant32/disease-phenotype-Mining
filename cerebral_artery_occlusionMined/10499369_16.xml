<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clenbuterol (0.01-0.5 mg/kg) reduced the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in Long-Evans rats as measured 7 days after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dosages of clenbuterol higher than 1 mg/kg showed no cerebroprotective effect due to a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cortical and hippocampal tissue occurred earlier after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and was more pronounced in animals treated with clenbuterol than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was enhanced in astrocytes 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in clenbuterol-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that growth factor synthesis is enhanced in activated astrocytes and that this could be the mechanism of clenbuterol-induced cerebroprotection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
