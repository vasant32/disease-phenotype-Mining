<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve animals were classified into three groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (mild, moderate, and severe) based on the severity of electrocorticographic (ECoG) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at the end of the recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four animals were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) resulted in a marked but similar degree of reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After this initial change, CBF increased continuously during occlusion in the mild group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF in the moderate and severe groups remained at the same low level during the entire period of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after MCAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> reduction was increased by approximately 50% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of MCAO, while the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> redox state returned to its pre-ischemic reference level in the severe group, it remained markedly reduced in the mild and moderate groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Removal of the clip led to slight reactive hyperemia in the mild and severe groups but not in the moderate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediately after recirculation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> redox was shifted toward oxidation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this reoxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> was only partial in the mild and moderate groups, and a pronounced hyperoxidation occurred in the severe group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In spite of the similar behavior of CBF in the recovery period, a marked secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> reduction occurred in the moderate group during the recirculation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this represents cessation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> electron transport in the dying cells, accompanied by stimulated anaerobic glycolysis in other cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
