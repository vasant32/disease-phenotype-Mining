<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Netrins have been implicated in neuronal pathfinding and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of Netrin-4 and its putative receptors, deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>), Unc5A, and Unc5B after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Netrin-4 protein was also administered intracerebroventricularly to examine its effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and behavioral recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Netrin-4 protein was highly upregulated in the ischemic core as soon as 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, with subsequent downregulation after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its expression was limited to the area of blood-brain barrier damage and was seen on both blood vessels and astrocytic foot processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was not a significant upregulation of the putative Netrin-4 receptor Unc5A and Unc5B, there was a significant increase in expression of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> receptor on neuronal processes in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of Netrin-4 into the ischemic brain increased blood vessel density, endothelial proliferation, and improved behavioral recovery at 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but did not have an effect on blood-brain barrier permeability or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Netrin-4 may improve poststroke functional recovery by enhancing blood vessel proliferation </plain></SENT>
