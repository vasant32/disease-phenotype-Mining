<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been proved that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration and pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> could protect brain tissue against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and underlying mechanisms in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 was used to evaluate time course expressions of 12/15-LOX, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylated-p38MAPK (phospho-p38MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, seven time points were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 was used to detect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>'s neuroprotection in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> was administered immediately after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured at 24h after stoke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to analyze the expression of 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK and cPLA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiment 3 was used to detect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>'s influence on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK and cPLA2 were up-regulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with MCAO group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> dramatically reduced brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes, and the over-expressions of 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK and cPLA2 were significantly decreased in high dose group (20mg/kg, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, extra-vascular IgG was not only reduced, but <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was also ameliorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> protected brain from damage caused by MCAO at the early stage; this effect may be through down-regulation of 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK and cPLA2 expressions, and ameliorating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
