<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> can be used as an energy substrate by the brain by conversion to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and a subsequent oxidation in the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowing the need for readily metabolizable substrates directly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> after excitotoxicity, the aim of this study was to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> administration directly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> could be neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the addition of 4 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16651">L-lactate</z:chebi> to the medium of rat organotypic hippocampal slices, directly after oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), protected against neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whereas a higher dose of 20 mmol/L was toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the mouse, an intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microL of 100 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16651">L-lactate</z:chebi>, immediately after reperfusion, led to a significant decrease in lesion size, which was more pronounced in the striatum, and an improvement in neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A later injection 1 h after reperfusion did not reduce lesion size, but significantly improved neurologic outcome, which is an important point in the context of a potential clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a moderate increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be a therapeutic tool </plain></SENT>
