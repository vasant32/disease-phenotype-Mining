<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Release of excitatory amino acids (EAA) is considered a cause of neuronal damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the sources and mechanisms of EAA release using microdialysis in regions of incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> where perfusion was reduced by 50% to 80%, by applying inhibitors of volume-regulated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channels (VRACs) and the GLT-1 glutamate transporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) was induced in anesthetized rats using the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microdialysate concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> were measured before, during 2 hours of rMCAo, and for 2 hours after rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle, dihydrokainate (DHK, 1 mmol/L), a GLT-1 inhibitor, or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (50 micromol/L), a VRAC inhibitor, were administered continuously via the dialysis probes starting one hour prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, dialysate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels averaged 1.74+/-0.31 micromol/L (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) in the control group (n=8), 2.08+/-0.33 micromol/L in the DHK group (n=7), and were significantly lower at 0.88+/-0.30 micromol/L in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> group (n=9; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As perfusion returned toward baseline levels, EAA levels declined in the vehicle and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-treated animals but they remained elevated in the DHK-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous results in severely ischemic regions, DHK did not reduce EAA release in less severely ischemic brain, suggesting a diminished role for transporter reversal in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings also support the hypothesis that in regions of incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, release of EAAs via VRACs may play a larger role than reversal of the GLT-1 transporter </plain></SENT>
