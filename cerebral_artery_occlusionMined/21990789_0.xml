<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tandem proximal and distal occlusions in the setting of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are therapeutic challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treating either lesion first has its respective shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An approach is described which may lessen the probability of distal embolic events during emergency carotid angioplasty and stenting during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and simplify access to both a distal and proximal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man presented with waxing and waning neurological examination with an NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale varying from 4 to 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT angiography demonstrated a left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at its origin and a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CT scan failed to demonstrate significant ischemic changes so the patient was brought to angiography for treatment under conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Triaxial access into the distal middle cerebral artery was achieved followed by brief <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and clot maceration by opening the vessel completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An embolic protection device was deployed through the intermediate catheter which was subsequently removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenting and angioplasty were then performed, followed by removal of the embolic protection device which had visibly trapped debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Embolic protection devices may have a role in the emergency treatment of proximal occlusions in the setting of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safe deployment through an occluded vessel may be assisted by use of an intermediate catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Penumbra 054 catheter may be used both to aspirate the distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and to house the embolic protection device as it is advanced past a proximal occlusion </plain></SENT>
