<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three mild hypothermic groups according to the duration of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (MHT 32 +/- 0.2 degrees C): intra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (MHTi); intra-reperfusion (MHTr); and intra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/ reperfusion (MHTi + r) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our control group was normothermic (NT 37 +/- 0.2 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reversible focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was carried out in rats with a suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry to confirm occlusion and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The permeability of the blood-brain barrier was determined by the extravasation of Evans's blue dye, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> post-ischemic hyperperfusion and delayed hypoperfusion in the ischemic perifocal area and sustained hypoperfusion in the ischemic core were inhibited in MHTi + r and MHTi rats (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the NT rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The action of MHTi + r on preventing post-ischemic progressive hypoperfusion in the perifocal area was more effective than that of MHTi 2 h after reperfusion (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption in the basal ganglia and cortex areas was significantly reduced in both MHTi + r and MHTi groups, and especially the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in both MHTi and MHTi + r groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MHTi and MHTi + r have protective effects for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanisms may include inhibition of post-ischemic hyperperfusion, and delayed and sustained hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
