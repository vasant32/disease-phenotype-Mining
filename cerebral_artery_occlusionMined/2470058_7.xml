<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that cSCS increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cats and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the effects of cSCS on experimental cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, using a cat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 cats were randomly assigned to three groups; Group 1: control, Group 2: sham operation, Group 3: cSCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality of the control group was 92% as long as 4 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups 2 and 3 showed a prolongation of survival rate (44% and 56%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSCS reduced the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no alteration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, which was estimated by the TTC method and measured by computer technique (PDP-11/23), was found in dead cats of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cats that survived in Group 3, however, drastic prevention of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression was found, compared to Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results provide a clinical application of cSCS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, although no evident mechanism was obtained </plain></SENT>
