<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on the EEG alterations produced 30 min after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed a precipitous fall in mean EEG amplitude followed by a recovery during a 4 h recirculation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the subsequent 7 days there was a gradual secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the EEG amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, a secondary fall in EEG amplitude in the contralateral hemisphere was also noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups corresponding to the clinical phenomenon of 'diaschisis' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall neurological score differed significantly among the severe, moderate, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits on the 7th day were highly correlated with the degree of morphological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the reduction of EEG was also well correlated with the pathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in the cat has provided important data concerning the restitution of brain function following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
