<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using an 11.7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in 10-d-old rat pups we report on the evolution of injury over 28 d in a model of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (transient filament middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, tfMCAO) and a model of hypoxic-ischemic injury (Rice-Vannucci model, RVM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both models, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was more sensitive in the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injury volumes in both models were greater on d 1 for DWI and d 3 for T2WI, decreased over time and by d 28 T2WI injury volumes (tfMCAO 10.3% of ipsilateral hemisphere; RVM 23.9%) were definable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of injury with tfMCAO was confined to the vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery and a definable core and penumbra evolved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury in the RVM was more generalized and greater in cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contralateral hemispheric involvement was only observed in the RVM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that high-field MRI over extended periods of time is possible in a small animal model of neonatal brain injury and that the tfMCAO model should be used for studies of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that the RVM does not reflect the vascular distribution of injury seen with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
