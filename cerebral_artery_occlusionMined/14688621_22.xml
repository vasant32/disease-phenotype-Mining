<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this success in animal models, neuroprotective therapies in the clinical setting have been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of biochemical markers common to preclinical and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> will provide a more sensitive and objective measure of injury severity and outcome to facilitate clinical management and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are currently no effective biomarkers available for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonerythroid alphaII-spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that is cleaved by calpain and caspase-3 proteases to signature alphaII-spectrin breakdown products (alphaII-SBDPs) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This investigation examined accumulation of calpain- and caspase-3-cleaved alphaII-SBDPs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rodents subjected to 2 hours of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After MCAO injury, full-length alphaII-spectrin protein was decreased in brain tissue and increased in CSF from 24 to 72 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas alphaII-SBDPs were undetectable in sham-injured control animals, calpain but not caspase-3 specific alphaII-SBDPs were significantly increased in CSF after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, caspase-3 alphaII-SBDPS were observed in CSF of some injured animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that alphaII-SBDPs detected in CSF after injury, particularly those mediated by calpain, may be useful diagnostic indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> that can provide important information about specific neurochemical events that have occurred in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
