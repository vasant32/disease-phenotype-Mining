<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that daily treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> beginning at 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 2 or 4 consecutive days markedly suppressed the microglial response as detected immunohistochemically with OX-42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most dramatic effect was the prevention of transformation of ramified microglia into amoeboidic form as well as formation of perineuronal microglia in close association with the soma of motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has greatly amplified the potentiality of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> used as a neuroprotective drug against microglia-related neuron damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
