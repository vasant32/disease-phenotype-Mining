<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) are a highly pertinent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model with increased sensitivity to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with the normotensive reference strain (Wistar-Kyoto rats; WKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study aims were to investigate temporal changes in the ischemic penumbra in SHRSP compared with WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced with an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion- (PWI) weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed from 1 to 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with the PWI-DWI mismatch used to define the penumbra and thresholded apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps used to define ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significantly more ischemic damage in SHRSP than in WKY from 1 to 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The perfusion deficit remained unchanged in WKY (39.9+/-6 mm(2) at 1 hour, 39.6+/-5.3 mm(2) at 6 hours) but surprisingly increased in SHRSP (43.9+/-9.2 mm(2) at 1 hour, 48.5+/-7.4 mm(2) at 6 hours; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, SHRSP had a significantly smaller penumbra (3.4+/-5.8 mm(2)) than did WKY (9.7+/-3.8, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In WKY, 56% of the 1-hour penumbra area was incorporated into the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion by 6 hours, whereas in SHRSP, the small penumbra remained static owing to the temporal increase in both <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion size and perfusion deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: First, SHRSP have significantly more ischemic damage and a smaller penumbra than do WKY within 1 hour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; second, the penumbra is recruited into the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> abnormality over time in both strains; and third, the expanding perfusion deficit in SHRSP predicts more tissue at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results have important implications for management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and suggest ischemic damage could progress at a faster rate and over a longer time frame in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
