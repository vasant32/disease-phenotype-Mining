<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated a <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> extract from the leaf and stem of V. amurensis for neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemic damage in rats and on excitotoxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in cultured rat cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24h reperfusion (MCAO/reperfusion) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Orally administered V. amurensis (25-100 mg/kg) reduced MCAO/reperfusion-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, neurological deficits, and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) level and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation induced by MCAO/reperfusion was inhibited by administration of V. amurensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase of phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-apoptotic proteins and the decrease of anti-apoptotic protein in MCAO/reperfusion rats were significantly inhibited by treatment with V. amurensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cultured cortical neurons to 500 μM <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> for 12h induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>V. amurensis (1-50 μg/ml) and (+)-ampelopsin A, γ-2-viniferin, and trans-ε-viniferin isolated from the leaf and stem of V. amurensis inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and changes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins in cultured cortical neurons, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of V. amurensis may be partially attributed to these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of V. amurensis against focal cerebral ischemic injury might be due to its anti-apoptotic effect, resulting from anti-excitotoxic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects and that the leaf and stem of V. amurensis have possible therapeutic roles for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
