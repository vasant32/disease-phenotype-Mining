<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are the growth factors regulating hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously observed that SCF and G-CSF have neuroprotective and functional effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the beneficial effects of SCF and G-CSF on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SCF, G-CSF, or SCF+G-CSF was administered subcutaneously to rats 3.5 months after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were evaluated by limb placement test and foot fault test over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Field-evoked potential was performed 19 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was histologically determined using serial coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant functional improvement was seen in SCF+G-CSF-treated rats 1, 5, and 17 weeks after injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SCF alone also improved functional outcome, but it did not show as stable improvement as SCF+G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No functional benefit was seen in G-CSF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Field-evoked potential studies further confirmed the behavioral data that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of neuronal activity was reestablished in the lesioned brain of the rats with good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, infarction volume was also significantly reduced in SCF+G-CSF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide first evidence that functional restoration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> can be attained using hematopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
