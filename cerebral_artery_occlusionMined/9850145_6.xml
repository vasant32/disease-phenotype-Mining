<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced signal transduction in vivo, we investigated the effect of the targeted disruption of the alpha and delta isoforms of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) on c-fos and heatshock protein (hsp) 72 gene induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery of the CREB mutant mice (CREB(-/-), n = 5) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the neurologic score was assessed and pictorial measurements of ATP and cerebral protein synthesis (CPS) were carried out to differentiate between the ischemic core (where ATP is depleted), the ischemic penumbra (where ATP is preserved but CPS is inhibited), and the intact tissue (where both ATP and CPS are preserved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in neurologic score or in ATP, pH, and CPS between the two groups, suggesting that the sensitivity of both strains to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeted disruption of the CREB gene significantly attenuated c-fos gene induction in the periischemic ipsilateral hemisphere but had no effect on either c-fos or hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observations demonstrate that CREB expression, despite its differential effect on c-fos, does not modulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
