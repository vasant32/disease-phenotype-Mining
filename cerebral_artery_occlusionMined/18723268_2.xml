<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of low frequency ultrasound in transcranial therapeutic application in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate safety aspects and potential deleterious effects of low frequency, 60 kHz ultrasound in treatment of experimental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five male Wistar rats were submitted to either temporary (90 min; groups I and II) or permanent MCAO (groups III and IV) using the suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) starting 90 min after the beginning of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups I and III were additionally treated with 60 kHz ultrasound (time average acoustic intensity 0.14 W/cm(2), duty cycle 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome assessment consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation after 5 and 24 h, and histology (perfusion fixation after 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was higher in animals treated with ultrasound (43% versus 29% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most animals died during the insonation period (25% in group I, 36% in group III, no animals in the corresponding control groups; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed disseminated microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> as one possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After temporary occlusion, the hemispheric ischemic lesion volume was more than doubled in animals treated with ultrasound (20.3% +/- 14.1% versus 8.6% +/- 5.1% in controls; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in lesion volume was seen after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment showed impairment of hearing as an additional specific side effect in ultrasound treated animals (65%, no impairment in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the results are not directly transferable to the human setting, this study clearly demonstrates the potential limitations of low frequency therapeutic ultrasound and the importance of pre-clinical safety assessment </plain></SENT>
