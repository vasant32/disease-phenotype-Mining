<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>  Recent investigations have postulated a link between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction in cerebral ischaemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is common amongst elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and has been postulated to aggravate brain I/R damage by triggering oxidative as well as ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (1-10 mg/kg), a potent free radical scavenger protects against cerebral I/R injury in rats associated with comorbid type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats exposed to 2-hr middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 22 hr of reperfusion significantly had increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> volume and functional neurological deficits as compared to sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the massive DNA fragmentation accompanied by significant increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labelling (TUNEL) positive cells was noticed in the ipsilateral penumbral brain region of diabetic I/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of I/R injury were associated with significant up-regulation of 78 kDa-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153) and activation of caspase-12, markers of ER stress/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly diminished the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> volume and improved functional recovery of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> treatment ameliorated the DNA fragmentation concomitantly with a significant decrease in induction of GRP78, CHOP/GADD153 immunoreactivity/expression and activation of caspase-12 in the ischaemic brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the present data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> offers good neuroprotection against diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by interrupting the ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways involving CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
