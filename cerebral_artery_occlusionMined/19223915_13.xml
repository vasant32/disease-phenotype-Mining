<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profound changes were detected as early as 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which include elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels in the presence of significant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, decreases in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and a transient twofold glutamine increase, likely to be linked to the excitotoxic release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and conversion into glial glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, decreases in N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), as well as in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, exceeded those in neuronal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, suggesting that the putative neuronal marker <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> is rather a sensitive marker of neuronal viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> evolution, additional, more profound concentration decreases were detected, reflecting a disruption of cellular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early changes in markers of energy metabolism, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity and neuronal viability can be detected with high precision non-invasively in mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such investigations should lead to a better understanding and insight into the sequential early changes in the brain parenchyma after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which could be used for identifying new targets for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
