<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tasks demonstrated that 2 h of transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in a significant decrease in spatial discrimination performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The escape latency at 4 and 5 days of acquisition trial was lower in the ischemic rats than in sham-operated rats (33.8+/-6.7 sec and 26.8+/-5 sec versus 12.2+/-4.0 sec and 10.4+/-3.6 sec), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with clau (10 mg kg(-1) p.o. once daily) significantly improved the impairment (12.4+/-4.1 sec and 15.2+/-3.1 sec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, the changes in population spike (PS) amplitude were recorded as an index of LTP in the perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in PS amplitude between the sham-operated and vehicle-treated animals, whereas the fractional increase of PS 20-50 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> was significantly larger in clau-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis revealed that clau could protect against neuron loss in the regions of cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data indicate a beneficial effect of clau for synaptic plasticity and cognitive function impaired by transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
