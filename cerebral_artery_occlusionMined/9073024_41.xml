<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the ability of this model to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, male Wistar rats (n = 7) were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, and diffusion and T2 weighted MRI were performed on these rats before, during and up to 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI tissue signatures, specified by values of ADCw and T2 were assigned to tissue histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were obtained between MRI signatures at different time points and histopathologic measurements of lesion area obtained at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the temporal evolution of MRI tissue signatures to a separate population of animals at which histological data were obtained at select times of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant shift (p &lt; or = 0.05) within signatures reflecting tissue histopathology was demonstrated as the ischemic lesion evolved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest, that the MRI signatures are associated with the degree of ischemic cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the tissue signature model may provide a noninvasive means to monitor the evolution of ischemic cell damage and to predict final outcome of ischemic cell damage </plain></SENT>
