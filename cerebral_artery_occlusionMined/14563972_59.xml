<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ASTIN (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Therapy by Inhibition of Neutrophils) was an adaptive phase 2 dose-response-finding, proof-of-concept study to establish whether UK-279,276 improves recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prime objective was to determine the dose that gave a clinically relevant effect in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Bayesian sequential design with real-time efficacy data capture and continuous reassessment of the dose response allowed double-blind, randomized, adaptive allocation to 1 of 15 doses (dose range, 10 to 120 mg) or placebo and early termination for efficacy or futility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was change from baseline to day 90 on the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (DeltaSSS), adjusted for baseline SSS, aiming for a 3-point additional mean recovery above placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (887 ischemic, 204 cotreated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; mean baseline SSS score, 28; range, 10 to 40) were treated within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean DeltaSSS was approximately +17 points of improvement on SSS for the overall evaluable population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment effect for UK-279,276 (posterior probability of futility, 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped early for futility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analysis indicated a mean 1.6-point additional improvement on DeltaSSS in the tissue plasminogen activator-treated subset (credible interval=0.5, 2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UK-279,276 was generally well tolerated, with no increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UK-279,276 did not improve recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients but was devoid of serious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The adaptive design facilitated early termination for futility </plain></SENT>
