<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy male SD rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10 for each): (1) Control group: animals were subjected to I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2)RIPC groups: RIPC was performed by 3 cycles of occlusion/reperfusion of bilateral femoral arteries for 5 minutes/5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the different intervals between RIPC and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), 6 RIPC subgroups were established: RIPC 30 minutes, 1, 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours subgroups, with intervals between RIPC and cerebral I/R of 30 minutes, 1, 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of MCAO was 120 minutes and reperfusion for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological dysfunction score (NDS) was evaluated at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume was then assessed with tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NDSs of RIPC 1, 2 and 24 hours groups were significantly lower than that of control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05), while with no significant differences of RIPC 30 minutes, 12 and 48 hours groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area percentage of infarction in RIPC 1 hour [(17.9+/-7.5)%, P=0.016], RIPC 2 hours [(18.3+/-11.2)%, P=0.019] and RIPC 24 hours [(20.2+/-11.9)%, P=0.047] groups was significantly smaller than that in control group [(30.5+/-9.8)%], while no significant differences were observed in RIPC 30 minutes, 12 and 48 hours groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The RIPC the brain against focal cerebral I/R injury in rats, and the protection window is 1 to 2 hours after pretreatment and resumes after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
