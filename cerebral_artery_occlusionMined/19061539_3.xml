<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were randomly assigned to four groups: Group 1, IN administration of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for control; Group 2, IN administration of NGF alone; Group 3, EA with IN administration of PBS; Group 4, IN administration of NGF with EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatments were initiated at 2 hours after MCAO and continued for three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received daily injections of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally for 7 days starting at 24 hours after reperfusion and were killed at 2 hours or 21 days after the last BrdU injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for BrdU was performed to identify newborn cells in the ipsilateral subventricular zone and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination treatment led to significant improvement in neurological function and reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and survival of progenitors were enhanced in rats treated with the combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IN administration of NGF and EA may have a synergistic effect in preventing ischemic injury and enhancing functional recovery after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which may be attributed to enhanced cell proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
