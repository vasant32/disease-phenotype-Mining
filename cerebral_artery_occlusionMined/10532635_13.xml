<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which IL-1beta affects ischemic brain are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of IL- 1beta in regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the authors studied mutant mice deficient in the IL-1 converting enzyme (ICE) gene (ICE knockout [KO] mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four adult male ICE KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice underwent 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using the suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 protein in ischemic brain was examined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither ICE KO nor <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice had significant differences in CBF and body temperature measurements during the ischemic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha expression increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere after 3 hours of occlusion, peaked at 12 hours and decreased at 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both ICE KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 immunohistochemistry showed that the number of ICAM-1-positive vessels in the ischemic hemisphere was reduced in ICE KO mice (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that ICAM-1 protein expression was significantly attenuated in the ipsilateral hemisphere in the ICE KO mice, which paralleled the immunohistochemistry results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors' results indicate that TNF-alpha expression is increased in both ICE KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice suggesting that TNF-alpha expression is not related to or upregulated by IL-1beta  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 expression is significantly reduced in the ICE KO mice suggesting that IL-1beta plays an important role in the upregulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
