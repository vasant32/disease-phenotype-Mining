<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A nuclear magnetic resonance study of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed on seven animals before and after occlusion, which occurred in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The emphasis in this study was on evaluating rapid proton spectroscopic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were acquired with experimental durations of between 4 and 15 minutes for a 32 by 32 spatial matrix, with 64 spectroscopic data points per spatial element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spectroscopic data were interleaved with diffusion-weighted nuclear magnetic resonance water images of the same slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was terminated at about 6 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the signal from N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> decreased and that of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased within the infarcted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The temporal course of these intensity changes varied between animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> (CSD) were observed by electrophysiologic monitoring during the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 11 could be unambiguously detected in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> images, and a further 3 were on the threshold of detectability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As only a single slice could be examined, it is possible that the centers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> for the remaining 6 CSD were outside the slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the measurement of CSD using proton spectroscopic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is shown that this method is valuable not only in following the continuous evolution of proton metabolites with a good spatial and temporal resolution, but also in observing transient phenomena which are believed to play an important role in the expansion of the infarcted territory </plain></SENT>
