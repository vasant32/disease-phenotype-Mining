<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between MCAO and sham groups postoperatively, indicating focal ischemic insult induced by this model had no significant influence on TFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased sensitivity to TFL in early postoperative period was shown when compared sham or MCAO with non-op group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between TFL and the time from surgery was statistically significant on the 1st and 7th days in sham group and the 1st, 7th and 14th days in MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the focal ischemic injury resulting from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> that has no obvious neurologic effects does not alter pain threshold; however, surgical procedure increases postoperative sensitivity to pain stimulation </plain></SENT>
