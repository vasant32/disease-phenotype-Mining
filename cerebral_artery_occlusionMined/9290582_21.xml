<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain from rats (n = 6) subjected to 2 hours of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 46 hours of reperfusion, and control sham-operated (n = 3) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 2) rats were processed for dual label immunohistochemical study for cellular identification of the expression of these cell cycle proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies raised against microtubule-associated protein 2 and neuronal specific enolase for neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes, myelin basic protein for oligodendrocytes and lectin histochemical study with the B4-isolectin for microglia were used for cell type identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double staining for DNA fragmentation detection (TUNEL) and expression of cyclin D1 and cdk4 also was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 and cdk4 were selectively expressed in morphologically intact or altered neurons and oligodendrocytes localized to the ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cells were not immunoreactive to cyclin D1 and cdk4 at 46 hours after 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The selective expression of cell cycle proteins observed in nonapoptotic ischemic postmitotic neurons and oligodendrocytes suggests a role for these proteins in cell survival after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
