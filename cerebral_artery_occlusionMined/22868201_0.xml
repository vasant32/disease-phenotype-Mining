<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebralcare GranuleÂ® (CG) is a compound Chinese medicine widely used in China for treatment of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CG has been demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the cerebral microcirculatory disturbance and hippocampal neuron injury following global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of CG on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of CG on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) were subjected to 1h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CG (0.4 g/kg or 0.8 g/kg) was administrated orally 3h after reperfusion for the first time and then once daily up to 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that Evans blue extravasation, brain water content, albumin leakage, infarction volume and neurological deficits increased in MCAO model rats, and were attenuated significantly by CG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted MRI and electron microscopy further confirmed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> reduction in CG-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CG improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy showed that the tight junction proteins claudin-5, JAM-1, occludin and zonula occluden-1 between endothelial cells were significantly degradated, but the protein expression of caveolin-1, the principal marker of caveolae in endothelial cells, increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were alleviated by CG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the post-treatment with CG significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, which were correlated with preventing the degradation of the tight junction proteins and inhibiting the expression of caveolin-1 in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a novel approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
