<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of glia to recover essential functions following a period of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is likely to be one important factor influencing the severity of tissue damage that subsequently develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have compared changes in immunoreactivity of markers specific for astrocytes, NG2-positive glia and neurons in tissue subregions during early reperfusion following 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to provide insights into possible differential susceptibility of these cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions used, infarction ultimately encompasses most of the perfusion territory of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, alterations in immunoreactivity during the first 3 h of recirculation were restricted to brain regions that had been subjected to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the striatum, cellular immunoreactivity for NG2 and neuronal markers, NeuN and microtubule-associated protein 2, was greatly reduced by 1 h of reperfusion and declined further at 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NG2 labeling of blood vessels in the striatum appeared post-ischemically, mimicking expression of this protein during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Less severe changes were seen in the neuronal markers in overlying cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the losses of other cellular proteins, immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, was preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue that had been subjected to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and labeling of another astrocytic protein, glutamine synthetase, was increased by 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide the first evidence of marked sensitivity of NG2-immunoreactivity to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and suggest a greater initial resistance of astrocytes compared with neurons and NG2-positive glia to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion damage </plain></SENT>
