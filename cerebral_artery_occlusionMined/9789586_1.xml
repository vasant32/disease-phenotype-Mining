<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinic, 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients were randomly divided into 2 therapeutic groups: drug group and EA+ drug group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits of patients were evaluated before and after the treatment by Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated by drug or EA+ drug were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> partially recovered, but the clinical functional recovery in EA+ drug group was significantly better than in the drug group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In laboratory, the model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was used in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) was recorded before and after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EA was applied one hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and once a day after reperfusion for 7 days in EA+ MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the amplitude of P1-N1 wave of SEP before MCAO was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After MCAO 30 min the P1-N1 wave of SEP on the ipsilateral side of MCAO was decreased to 2.2 +/- 3% (MCAO group), 1.9 +/- 2% (MCAO+ EA group); and then recovered to 25.5 +/- 14.1% (MCAO group), 58.6 +/- 27.2% (MCAO+ EA group) after 7 days of reperfusion following MCAO 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The above results indicated that EA could promote the recovery of neurological function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and SEP on MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
