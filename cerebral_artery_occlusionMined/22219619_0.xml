<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We randomly divided white female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 30) into two groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 15) and sham group (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the 7th day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, after cutting away the epiphyses of the femurs and tibias, diaphyseal channels were flushed using α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) and bone marrow cells were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stem cells, which were extracted from the femur and tibia, were cultured on the 7th day after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then estimated the ratio of non-adherent cells to total bone marrow cells that included osteoclast precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After culturing these cells separately, cells that tested positive on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi> resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were counted and bone resorption was evaluated by using the OAAS™ plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the control group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group showed a higher increase of non-adherent cells in the hemiplegic side bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, after the primary culture, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group showed an increased number of TRAP positive cells and a higher degree of bone resorption estimated by OAAS™ plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast differentiation are accelerated and the potential of bone resorption is increased in the hemiplegic bone marrow and these changes are detected as early as within the first week after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in SD rats </plain></SENT>
