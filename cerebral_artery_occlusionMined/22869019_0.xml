<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the in vivo protective effect of geniposide on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-injured rats by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and the inhibitory effects of geniposide and mechanisms against activation of microglial cells by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male SD rats were subjected to treatment with geniposide at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg immediately after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and microglial cell activation were assessed following 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured primary rat microglial cells were exposed to geniposide at the concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL during 4 h of OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of geniposide were evaluated in terms of (1) cell viability; (2) secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 into culture media; (3) TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression; (4) protein expression of TLR4, p-ERK1/2, p-IκB, p-p38, nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction NF-κB p65; and (5) nuclear transfer of NF-κB p65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Geniposide reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and inhibited the activation of microglial cells in ischemic penumbra in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OGD increased cell viability and release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, these effects were suppressed by geniposide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Geniposide also attenuated the increases in the OGD-induced TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, geniposide at 25 and 50 μg/mL downregulated the phosphorylation of ERK, IκB and p38, as well as inhibited nuclear transcriptional activity triggered via NF-κB p65 in microglial cells by OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, geniposide displays a neuroprotective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-injured rats in vivo and inhibits OGD-induced activation of microglial cells by attenuating inflammatory factors and NF-κB activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
