<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies have shown that foods rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi>, can lower the risk of ischemic disease; however, the mechanism of protection has not been clearly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that pretreatment effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (CH) on functional outcome, neuronal damage and on secondary injuries in the ischemic brain of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were pretreated with CH (20 mg/kg b.wt) for 21 days and then subjected to 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h MCAO/22 h reperfusion, neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes, activities of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and cytokines level were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to analyse the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (iNOS) and NF-kB in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of CH showed marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, reduced the neurological deficits, suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and downregulate the iNOS, GFAP and NF-kB expression in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly depleted activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in MCAO group were protected significantly in MCAO group pretreated with CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the elevated level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive species and cytokines in MCAO group was attenuated significantly in CH pretreated group when compared with MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that CH protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO, and this effect may be through downregulation of NF-kB expression </plain></SENT>
