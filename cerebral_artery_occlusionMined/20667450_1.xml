<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well documented that cannabinoid receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> WIN 55,212-2 had protective effect against cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous study indicated that WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment induced ischemic tolerance to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the time-effect relationship of the WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment and explore the role of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were pretreated with 1mg/kg WIN 55,212-2 once a day for 1, 3 and 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours after the end of pretreatment, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain ischemic injury was evaluated by neurological function scores and infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of U0126, a potent and specific inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase, on WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in the penumbra of ischemic side 4h after reperfusion was investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment can protect the rat brain against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury, and its protective effect was enhanced gradually with increasing numbers of pretreatment, and was partially reversed by U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further found that WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment up-regulated the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of WIN 55,212-2 pretreatment against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in rats </plain></SENT>
