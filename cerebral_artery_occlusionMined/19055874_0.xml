<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of new neural precursors after transient middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in adult Wistar rats (n=13) using the monofilament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the experimental group (n=8), animals were harvested at days 3, 7, 10, 17 and 21 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sagittal sections through the ischemic cortex were double-stained for neural (nestin and beta-tubulin, nestin and PCNA), glial (nestin and GFAP) and oligodendroglial (nestin and O4, CNP and PCNA) precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-stained cells were also counted under high-power view and tabulated over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the subventricular zone (SVZ), there was positive double-staining starting at day 3 showing proliferating astrocytic precursors (nestin + GFAP, 5-20% of cells), neuronal stem cells (nestin + PCNA, 95% of cells) and neuronal precursors (nestin + beta-tubulin, 50% of cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the penumbra, a more robust response showed more astrocytic precursors (50-80% of cells), premature and differentiated oligodendrocytes, neuronal stem cells (85% of cells) and neuronal precursors (15% of cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the area of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there was an intermediate response consisting of more astrocytic precursors (10-20% of cells), premature oligodendrocytes (45-100% of cells), neuronal stem cells (95% of cells) and neuronal precursors (25% of cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed with cell counting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our results show that not only do neural precursors proliferate in the SVZ, there is definite and real response in the penumbra and ischemic cortex, suggesting the ability of repair in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
