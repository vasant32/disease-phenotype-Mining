<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we asked whether reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> can be suppressed in the lesion area by cell cycle inhibition and thus have therapeutic benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> induced in either cultured astrocytes by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or scratch injury, or in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model were combined to address this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cultured astrocytes, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induced a cell cycle activation that was associated with upregulation of the proliferating cell nuclear marker (PCNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the cell cycle inhibitor, olomoucine, inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced cell cycle activation by arresting the cells at G1/S and G2/M in a dose-dependent manner and also reversed <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced upregulation of PCNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also in the cultured astrocytes, scratch injury induced reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and an increase in BrdU(+) astrocytes, both of which were ameliorated by olomoucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the MCAO <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> mouse model, dense reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein and PCNA immunoreactivity were evident at the boundary zone of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at days 7 and 30 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that intraperitoneal olomoucine administration significantly inhibited these <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>-associated changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate further that cell cycle regulation impacts on <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>, cyclin D1 gene knockout mice (cyclin D1(-/-)) were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and we found that the percentage of Ki67-positive astrocytes in these mice was markedly reduced in the boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of apoptotic neurons and the lesion volume in cyclin D1(-/-) mice also decreased as compared to cyclin D1(+/+) and cyclin D1(+/-) mice at days 3, 7, and 30 after local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these in vitro and in vivo results strongly suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> can be significantly affected by cell cycle inhibition, which therefore emerges as a promising intervention to attenuate reactive glia-related damage to neuronal function in brain pathology </plain></SENT>
