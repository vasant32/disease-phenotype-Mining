<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult Wistar rats (n = 5) were subjected to 120 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve hours after reopening the artery, brain tissue was analyzed to determine the extent of neuronal damage (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin), and the distribution of p53 and hsp72 (monoclonal antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that p53 is expressed in regions of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>; in contrast, morphologically intact neurons express hsp72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the presence of p53 is associated with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and that hsp72 may regulate p53 function </plain></SENT>
