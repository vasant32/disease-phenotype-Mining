<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of Nav1.1 and the effect of electroacupuncture therapy (ET) on it after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic model was established by occluding right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-five male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group, ET group and riluzole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence and real-time PCR were used to observe Nav1.1 expression, and TTC staining was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of Nav1.1 in sham operation group had no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the expression of Nav1.1 was up-regulated evidently at 6 hours compared with sham operation group, down-regulated at 1 day and up-regulated again from 2 to 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; the expression at 7 days was lower than that at 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ET group and riluzole group, Nav1.1 expression were down-regulated compared with that in MCAO group after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was smaller than that in MCAO group at the same time point, and the difference is significant (p&lt;0.05); however, the difference between ET group and riluzole group is not significant (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ET and riluzole could regulate the expression of Nav1.1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, decrease the infarction volume and reduce cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the important mechanisms for ET's cerebral protective function may be that it could regulate the expression of Nav1.1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
