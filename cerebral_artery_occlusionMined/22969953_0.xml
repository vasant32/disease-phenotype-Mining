<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in rats was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The KRG extract (100 mg/kg, perorally) was administered once daily for 7 days following MCAO/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in the MCAO/R group were attenuated significantly in the KRG-administered group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significantly depleted activity of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase was prevented in the KRG-administered group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the neurobehavioral evaluation expressed as the modified neurological severity score and corner-turn test, the daily intake of KRG showed consistent and significant improvement in the neurological deficits for 7 days following MCAO/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that KRG has a neuroprotective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion brain injury by reducing the level of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and increasing the endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
