<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prestimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) was 38.2 +/- 12.9 (SD) ml 100 g-1 min-1 and fell to 19.8 +/- 11.1 following occlusion (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak hydrogen clearance rate (percent increase above prestimulus clearance) was 81.6 +/- 53.6 and fell to 19.9 +/- 29.8 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Steady-state <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence rose from 33.5 +/- 10.7 to 40.5 +/- 17.6% full-scale deflection following MCAO (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Latency from stimulus to maximal fluorescence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in response to cortical stimulation increased from 12.2 +/- 8.2 to 22.1 +/- 11.9 s (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperaemic responses at anteromedial sites on the marginal gyrus significantly exceeded those at posterolateral sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are interpreted as indicating early ischaemic metabolic change; however, the presence of residual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> responses to stimulation suggests that flow reduction and early ischaemic change in the territory studied are not simply due to inadequate collateral input, but may also reflect deafferentation or functional suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of diminished vascular reactivity in the penumbra as a cause of increased vulnerability to extracellular release of excitatory amino acids is discussed </plain></SENT>
