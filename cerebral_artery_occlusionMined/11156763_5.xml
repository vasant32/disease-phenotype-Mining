<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of asymptomatic major cerebral artery occlusive disease is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rate of symptomatic change, appearance of new lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, and cerebral hemodynamics were analyzed for patients with asymptomatic major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included asymptomatic patients who had occlusive disease between 1992 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were used to detect internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in 3965 neurologically asymptomatic patients and for follow-up of affected patients for 67 to 105 months (mean, 79 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity were examined by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT at rest and after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 17 had ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, five patients became symptomatic (four with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and one with ICA occlusion), with no significant difference (P = .332) in the rate of symptomatic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these five patients, new infarction occurred on the ipsilateral side in three patients, contralateral side in one, and bilateral sides in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New stenotic or occlusive changes occurred in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into groups: group A, without new lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images (n = 23), and group B, with new lesions (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in regional cerebral blood flow value between groups A and B in the whole hemisphere, anterior cerebral artery territory, or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in cerebrovascular reserve capacity between groups A and B between the affected side (P = .00051 and P = .00068, respectively) and the contralateral side (P = .00101 and P = .00115, respectively) for the whole hemisphere and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and the difference was more severe on the affected side in both regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These pilot data suggest that asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion has a worse prognosis than does ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Silent events are common bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may be because of hemodynamic factors or perhaps <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is a marker for a more progressive type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A prospective study involving assessment of hemodynamics and baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is indicated </plain></SENT>
