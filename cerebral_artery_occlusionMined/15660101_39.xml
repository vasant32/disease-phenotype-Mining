<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the potential functional benefits of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male mice underwent 60-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and received G-CSF (50 microg/kg, subcutaneously) or vehicle (saline) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-treated mice killed at 48 hours after MCAO revealed a &gt;45% reduction (P&lt;0.05) in lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of body weight recovery, and in tests of motor (grid test and rotarod) and cognitive ability (water maze), MCAO significantly worsened the outcome in vehicle-treated mice as compared with shams (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, G-CSF treatment was beneficial as, compared with vehicle, this significantly improved weight recovery and motor ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was most apparent on the water maze where G-CSF-treated mice were indistinguishable from shams in terms of acquiring the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate long-term beneficial effects of a single dose of G-CSF administered on reperfusion, and illustrate the need to further investigate the mechanisms of G-CSF action </plain></SENT>
