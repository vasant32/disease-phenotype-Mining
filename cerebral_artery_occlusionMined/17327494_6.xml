<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide screen found a blood pressure quantitative trait locus (QTL) on rat chromosome 1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats of a Japanese colony (SHRSP/Izm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of congenic removal of this QTL from SHRSP/Izm on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size produced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish the congenic strain (SHRSPwch1.0), the blood pressure QTL was introgressed from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)/Izm to SHRSP/Izm by repeated backcrossing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male SHRSP/Izm [10-12 wk old (young adult) n = 8, 5 mo old (adult) n = 17] and SHRSPwch1.0 (young adult n = 7, adult n = 15) were randomly assigned to distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was 212 +/- 23 mmHg in adult SHRSPwch1.0, which was significantly lower than 241 +/- 22 mmHg in SHRSP/Izm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in the congenic rats was significantly decreased compared with that in SHRSP/Izm (66.4 +/- 21.5 mm(3) vs. 103.4 +/- 24.8 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), determined at collaterally-perfused cortex with laser-Doppler flowmetry after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, was significantly greater in adult SHRSPwch1.0 compared with CBF in adult SHRSP/Izm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In young adult rats, there were no significant differences in MABP or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between SHRSPwch1.0 and SHRSP/Izm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The congenic removal of a blood pressure QTL lowered blood pressure and caused a substantial reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (-36%) with increased collateral CBF after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the congenic rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated for the first time that the congenic strategy is useful to investigate the effects of genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
