<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in mice by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to test for potential neuroprotective properties of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In female CD-1 mice injected 30 min before MCAO, NGP1-01 (20 mg/kg) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area by 42.6% (P &lt; 0.05) compared to vehicle-treated controls as visualized by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, NGP1-01 reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> by 78.3% (P &lt; 0.001), compared to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data identify NGP1-01 and related compounds as potential lead structures to develop neuroprotective compounds based on a dual mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
