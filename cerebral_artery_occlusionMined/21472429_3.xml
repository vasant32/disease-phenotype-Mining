<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral immune cells, including T lymphocytes, migrate to the brain and exacerbate the developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant T-cell receptor (TCR) Ligand (RTL)551 is designed as a partial TCR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> for myelin oligodendrocyte <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (MOG)-reactive T cells and has demonstrated the capacity to limit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in brain when administered to mice undergoing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine if RTL551 could retain protection when given within the therapeutically relevant 4 h time window currently in clinical practice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RTL551 was administered subcutaneously 4 h after MCAO, with repeated doses every 24 h until the time of euthanasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell numbers were assessed in the brain, blood, spleen and lymph nodes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured after 24 and 96 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RTL551 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in both cortex and striatum at 24 h and in cortex at 96 h after MCAO and inhibited the accumulation of inflammatory cells in brain at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 h post-MCAO, RTL551 reduced the frequency of the activation marker, CD44, on T-cells in blood and in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RTL551 reduced expression of the chemokine receptors, CCR5 in lymph nodes and spleen, and CCR7 in the blood and lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate effective treatment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with RTL551 within a therapeutically relevant 4 h time window through immune regulation of myelin-reactive inflammatory T-cells </plain></SENT>
