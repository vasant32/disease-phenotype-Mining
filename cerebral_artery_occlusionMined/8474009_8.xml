<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent attenuation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 hr was documented with the maximum effective dose halving the volume of the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delayed administration at 5 min, but not 15 min, after vessel occlusion was as effective as preocclusion drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic sparing was confined to the cortical penumbra; no protection in the ischemic core was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically salvaged cortex was also metabolically preserved as demonstrated by quantitative measurement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo microdialysis demonstrated an attenuation of ischemic-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in the cortex with GM1 administration but no effect was found in the caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> did not occur even with doubling of the maximally effective dose of GM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, GM1 may be a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
