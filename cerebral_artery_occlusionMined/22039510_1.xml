<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research is carried out in rodents, but given differences between rodents and human, nonhuman primate (NHP) models may provide a valuable tool to study therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors developed a surgical method for transient occlusion of the M1 branch of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in the African green monkey to evaluate safety aspects of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) derived from human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The left Sylvian fissure was exposed by a small fronto-temporal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The M1 branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was exposed by microsurgical dissection and clipped for 2 to 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were carried out at regular post-operative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hMSCs were infused 1 hour after reperfusion (clip release) in the 3-hour occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During M1 occlusion, two patterns of changes were observed in the lateral hemisphere surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One pattern (Pattern 1) was darkening of venous blood, small vessel collapse, and blood pooling with no venous return in cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals with these three features had severe and lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and MRI demonstrated extensive <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals in the second pattern (Pattern 2) displayed darkening of venous blood, small vessel collapse, and reduced but incompletely occluded venous flow and the functional deficit was much less severe and MRI indicated smaller infarction areas in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The severe group (Pattern 1) likely had less extensive collateral circulation than the less severe group (Pattern 2) where venous pooling of blood was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hMSC infused animals showed a trend for greater functional improvement that was not statistically significant in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and no additive negative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate inter-animal variability of collateral circulation after complete M1 occlusion and that hMSC infusion is safe in the developed NHP <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
