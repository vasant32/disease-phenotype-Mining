<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have found that rats subjected to 15-min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) show <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the dorsolateral striatum only, and the resulting striatal lesion is associated with increased T1-weighted (T1W) signal intensity (SI) and decreased T2-weighted (T2W) SI at 2-8 weeks after the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the delayed increase in T1W SI in the ischemic region is associated with deposition of paramagnetic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has been suggested that other mechanisms, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tissue calcification</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, also contribute to the relaxation time changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, we measured changes in relaxation times, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, and elemental distributions in the brain of rats subjected to 15-min MCAO using MRI, in vivo 1H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy (MRS), and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that a delayed (2 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) increase in T1W SI in the ischemic striatum is associated with significant increases in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>, calcium, and iron, but without evident accumulation of MRS-visible <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also found that 15-min MCAO results in acutely reduced N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) ratio in the ipsilateral striatum, which recovers to the control level at 2 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
