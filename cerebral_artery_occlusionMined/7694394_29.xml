<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized cats underwent 4 hours of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after they were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous N omega-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, at a dose that completely inhibited cortical nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity (10 mg/kg, n = 10), or an equal volume of diluent (10 mL saline, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial blood flow measurements were made with radiolabeled microspheres, and injury volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow to caudate nucleus and inferior temporal cortex decreased to the same extent in both groups during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potential amplitude was reduced to less than 10% of baseline values in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injury volume of ipsilateral caudate nucleus in cats pretreated with nitroarginine (52 +/- 5%, mean +/- SE) was less (P &lt; .05) compared with the saline group (80 +/- 4%), whereas ipsilateral cerebral hemispheric injury volume was similar between the two groups (30 +/- 6% and 32 +/- 4% of hemisphere in saline and nitroarginine groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase decreases caudate injury volume at 4 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without an alteration in distribution of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
