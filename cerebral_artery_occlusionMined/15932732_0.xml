<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cortical neural cells of fetal SD rats were cultured for 12 days and exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation so as to establish a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another primary fetal rat cortical neuronal cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of GW9662, <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of PPAR-gamma, then underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for 3 hours, re-oxygenated for 21 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was added one hour after to measure the cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven male SD rats underwent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using suture and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven rats underwent sham operation. after the rats were killed and their brains were taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nucleoprotein was extracted from the cultured primary cortical cells and the cerebral cortexes of the rats and co-cultured with [gamma-(32)P]-labeled PPAR-gamma probe, EMSA to detect the PPAR-gamma binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PPAR-gamma activity of the cultured fetal rat cortical neurons that underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation significantly increased: It began to increase 1 hour after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and peaked in the 3rd hour of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, when the neurons underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for 3 hours and were reoxygenated for 2 hours, the binding activity still remained at a high level, and basically returned to the level of the untreated group 8 hours after reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were quantified with control group as 100, 3 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was 160.3, and 2, 4, 8 h after reoxygenation were 157.5, 136.6, 103.3 separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hour after reperfusion the PPAR-gamma binding activity of the cortical cells at the ischemic side of the rats began to increase and peaked at the 4th hour, significantly higher than those of the cortical cells at the opposite side and of the sham operation group (both P &lt; 0.01) then remained at a high level for the following 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of the cultured neurons that underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for 3 hours and reoxygenation for 21 hours was significantly lower than that of the untreated neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Data were quantified with sham surgery group as 100, the side of MCAO and the contra side in surgery group were 144.8 and 102.6 separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of the neurons that were pretreated with GW9662 and then underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation was significantly higher than that of those without pretreatment (P &lt; 0.01) with the peak protection effect of GW9662 at the concentration of 2.5 - 10 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Data were quantified with control group as 100, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation group was 184, GW9662 group was 105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PPAR-gamma binding activity of the primary cortical neurons pretreated with 5 micromol/L GW9662 for 30 minutes and than exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for 3 hours and reoxygenation for 2 hours was significantly lower than that of the only <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PPAR-gamma is involved in the pathogenesis of neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may become a new target of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
