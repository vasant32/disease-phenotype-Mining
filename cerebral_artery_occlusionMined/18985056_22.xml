<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 75 (Hsp75/Grp75/mortalin/TRAP1) is a member of the HSP70 chaperone family, which is targeted to mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Hsp75 was achieved in rat brain by DNA transfection, and expression was observed in both astrocytes and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 100 mins middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function, and levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> at 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Hsp75 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area from 44.6%+/-21.1% to 25.7%+/-12.1% and improved neurological outcome significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function as shown by protection of complex IV activity, marked reduction of free radical generation detected by hydroethidine fluorescence, reduction of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenol immunoreactivity, and increased preservation of ATP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that targeting mitochondria for protection may be a useful strategy to reduce ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
