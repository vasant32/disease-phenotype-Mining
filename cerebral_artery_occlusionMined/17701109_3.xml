<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of hypertensive rats in a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 92 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were subjected to left MCAO by an endovascular occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decompressive craniectomy was performed on 26 RHRSP at 1 and 24 h after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological performance, and mortality were evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality was reduced from 52.5% in controls to 7.7% and 23.1% in the rats underwent craniectomy at 1 and 24 h after MCAO, respectively (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the treated rats presented smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 1 week to 8 weeks and better neurological performance at 4-8 weeks after MCAO compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The craniectomy at early stage was more effective than that at late stage in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improving neurological performances at 1 and 2 weeks (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological scores between the treated groups of rats at 4 and 8 weeks after MCAO (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the early craniectomy is more effective than delayed craniectomy in improving short-term outcome, the latter has the similar beneficial effects as early craniectomy on long-term outcome in hypertensive rats with space-occupying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
