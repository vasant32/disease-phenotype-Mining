<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important energy sensor that is activated in times of energy demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing AMPK is deleterious in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, at least in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, studies in peripheral tissues have suggested that there are sex differences in the regulation of AMPK in muscle after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PolyADP <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase (PARP), a key mediator of ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, stimulates AMPK activation, yet activation of PARP appears to be selectively detrimental in male brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As interference with sex specific cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways can determine the efficacy of experimental neuroprotective agents, and AMPK inhibition is a novel neuroprotective target, we examined the effect of AMPK inhibition in male and female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, AMPK alpha2 gene expression (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and pAMPK protein levels were examined and found to be comparable between both sexes after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological deficits 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ovariectomized female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, genetic deletion of AMPK alpha2 in ovariectomized females was neuroprotective as assessed by smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurological deficits when compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates that AMPK activation is deleterious in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and this effect is independent of sex </plain></SENT>
