<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of this methodology improved yields and reaction times, providing a scalable procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds are pharmacologically interesting because of their inÂ vivo efficacy both in spinal cord injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> models, as shown in previous studies from our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein we describe for the first time that administration of one of the PDE7 inhibitors here optimized, 3-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-2,4-dithioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazoline (compound 5), ameliorated brain damage and improved behavioral outcome in a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that these PDE7 inhibitors are potent anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective agents in primary cultures of neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results led us to propose PDE7 inhibitors as a new class of therapeutic agents for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
