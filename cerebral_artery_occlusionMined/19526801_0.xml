<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the contents of hippocampal calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (CI) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty SD rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, sham operation (sham), model and EA groups with 10 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI model was duplicated by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2 Hz, 1 mA, continuous waves) was applied to "Shuigou" (GV 26) for 30 min, once daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal tissue was taken for assaying the contents of CGRP and NPY with radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, hippocampal CGRP content in model group decreased apparently (P&lt;0.01), while NPY content of model group increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, hippocampal CGRP in EA group increased considerably (P&lt;0.01) and NPY content decreased obviously (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture of GV26 can effectively adjust hippocampal CGRP and NPY contents in CI rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
