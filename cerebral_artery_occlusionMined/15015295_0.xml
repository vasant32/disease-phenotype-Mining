<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-three male Sprague Dawley rats with an average body weight of (165 +/- 15) g (mean +/- S) were used, and were randomly divided into two groups: group A rats (n = 11) underwent an operation of ischemic brain injury, group B rats (n = 12) underwent the same operation and received the treatment of Erigeron breviscapus preparation (1.5 mg.kg-1 weight, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of rats in both groups was induced by 5/0 nylon suture for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reperfusion was conducted for four hours and six hours respectively following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2 weighted-imaging (T2WI) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed, to study the changes of the imaging and the neuronal metabolites N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> (Lac) in cerebrum following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The hyperintense signals in the right cerebrum in group B decreased compared with those in group A, the T2 values decreased, the level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> increased, the ratio of Cr/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and Cho/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> decreased, and no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain surface vessels of rats in group B were in the state of dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Erigeron breviscapus preparation is beneficial to the reestablishment of the blood circulation in the ischemic brain, and to the improvement of the neuronal metabolism and survival </plain></SENT>
