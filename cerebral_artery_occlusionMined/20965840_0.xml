<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, IR group and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-treated group, and in the latter two groups, cerebral IR injury was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; Na2SeO3 treatment was administer in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 14 days after reperfusion, the brain tissues were harvested from the rats and hippocampal neuron injuries were observed by TUNEL and methylthionine staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampal tissues were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with IR group, the rats in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-treated group showed no significant increase in the expression of m-NGF (P&gt;0.05), but pro-NGF expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) in the hippocampal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Na2SeO3 treatment significantly inhibited the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β and decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hippocampal neurons following cerebral IR injury (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">Selenium</z:chebi> produces antiapoptotic effect to protect the hippocampla neurons following cerebral IR injury possibly not by increasing the level of m-NGF but by decreasing the expressions of the inflammatory factors </plain></SENT>
