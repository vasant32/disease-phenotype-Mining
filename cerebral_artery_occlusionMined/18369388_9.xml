<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether desferoxamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) preconditioning can induce tolerance against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and its effect on the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO) in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was examined by TTC staining, and the neurological severity score was evaluated according to published method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical neurons were cultured under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> stress which was mimicked by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), and the neuron damage was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining was employed to detect the expressions of HIF-1alpha and EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protective effect induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (decreasing the infarction volume and ameliorating the neurological function) appeared at 2 d after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>), lasted until 7 d and disappeared at 14 d (P &lt; 0.05); the most effective action was observed at 3 d post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> induced tolerance of cultured neurons against OGD: neuronal viability was increased 23%, 34%, 40%, 48% and 56% at 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, respectively, post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining found that HIF-1alpha and EPO were upregulated in the neurons of rat brain at 3 d and 7 d post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>; increase of HIF-1alpha and EPO appeared in cultured cortex neurons at 36 h and 48 h post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> induced tolerance against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, and exerted protective effect on OGD cultured cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> significant induced the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> preconditioning can protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which may be associated with the synthesis of HIF-1alpha and EPO </plain></SENT>
