<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present studies examined the hypothesis that the distribution of cerebral injury after a focal ischemic insult is associated with the regional distribution of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on previous studies that certain anatomically well-defined areas are prone to become either core or penumbra after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we measured NOS activity in these areas from the right and left hemispheres in a spontaneously hypertensive rat filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four groups were studied: (1) controls (immediate decapitation); (2) 1.5 hours of MCAO with no reperfusion (R0); (3) 1.5 hours of MCAO with 0.5 hour of reperfusion (R0.5); and (4) 1.5 hours of MCAO with 24 hours of reperfusion (R24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> sham controls were also included: 1.5 (S1.5) or 2 (S2.0) hours of anesthesia and 1.5 hours of anesthesia+24 hours of observation (S24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control core NOS activity for combined right and left hemispheres was 129% greater than penumbral NOS activity (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined core NOS activity was also greater (P&lt;0.05) in the three sham groups: 208%, 122%, and 161%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the three MCAO groups, ischemic and nonischemic core NOS remained higher than penumbral regions (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, NOS activity was lower in the ischemic than in the nonischemic core in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups: R0 (29% lower), R0.5 (48%), and R24 (86%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of cofactors (10 micromol/L tetrahydrobiopterin, 3 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24040">flavin adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi>, and 3 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24041">flavin mononucleotide</z:chebi>) increased NOS activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and lessened the decrease in ischemic core and penumbral NOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greater NOS activity in core regions could explain in part the increased vulnerability of that region to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and could theoretically contribute to the progression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that NOS activity during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion could be influenced by the availability of cofactors </plain></SENT>
