<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of vasculogenesis and embryonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, was recently found to be up-regulated in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike VEGF, angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2, their receptor tie-2, and the associated receptor tie-1 exert their functions at later stages of vascular development, i.e., during vascular remodeling and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of the angiopoietin/tie family in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> we analyzed their temporal and spatial expression pattern after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ang-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in a subset of glial and neuronal cells with no apparent change in expression after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ang-2 mRNA was up-regulated 6 hours after MCAO and was mainly observed in endothelial cell (EC) cord tips in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of both Ang-2 and VEGF coincided with EC proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, EC proliferation was preceded by a transient period of EC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, correlating with a change in VEGF/Ang-2 balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observation of specific stages of vascular regression and growth after MCAO are in agreement with recent findings suggesting a dual role of Ang-2 in blood vessel formation, depending on the availability of VEGF </plain></SENT>
