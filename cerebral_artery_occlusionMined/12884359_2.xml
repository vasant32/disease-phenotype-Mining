<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the substantia nigra ipsilateral to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was significantly lower and T(2) was significantly higher on the third and fourth days, but they did not change significantly on the first, second, eighth and 15th days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral thalamus, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and T(2) did not change significantly between the first and fourth days, but were significantly lower on the eighth and 15th days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings suggested that secondary degeneration in the thalamus was different from that in the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
