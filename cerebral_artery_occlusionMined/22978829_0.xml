<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: E-selectin was determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E-selectin knockout (Es(-/-) ) mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control (WT) mice underwent permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analyses were performed followed by the measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) protein was determined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ detection of apoptotic cells was performed by TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The brain and serum E-selectin levels were higher in SHR-SPs than in SHRs (P &lt; 0.05) after salt intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E-selectin deficiency improved neurological function and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in cerebral ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MPO and IL-1β were lower in Es(-/-) mice than in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of apoptotic cells in Es(-/-) mice was significantly less than in WT mice after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: E-selectin deficiency presents protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This protective effect is likely achieved by the inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
