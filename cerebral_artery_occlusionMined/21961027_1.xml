<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence emphasizes the role of T lymphocytes of differing subtypes in the evolution is ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated the benefit of myelin antigen-specific immunodulatory agents known as recombinant T cell receptor ligands (RTLs) in a standard murine model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to extend this initial observation to RTL treatment in a therapeutically relevant timing after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and verify functional benefit to complement histological outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that the administration of mouse-specific RTL551 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved sensorimotor outcome when administered within a 3 h post-ischemic therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RTL551 treatment reduced cortical, caudate putamen, and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as compared to vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a standard behavioral testing repertoire, we observed that RTL551 reduced sensorimotor impairment 3 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Humanized RTL1000 (HLA-DR2 moiety linked to hMOG-35-55 peptide) also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in HLA-DR2 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that this neuroantigen-specific immunomodulatory agent reduces damage when administered in a therapeutically relevant reperfusion timeframe </plain></SENT>
