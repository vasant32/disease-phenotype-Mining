<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed in parallel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with [(15)O]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(99m)Tc]hexamethylpropylene-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> ([(99m)Tc]HMPAO) and ultrasonic ultrafast shear wave imaging (SWI) during, immediately after, and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and SPECT showed initial hypoperfusion followed by recovery at immediate reperfusion, hypoperfusion at day 1, and hyperperfusion at days 4 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion interested the whole brain, including nonischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis indicated active <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> at days 2 to 7, strongly suggestive that hyperperfusion was supported by an increase in microvessel density in both brain hemispheres after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SWI detected elastic changes of cerebral tissue in the ischemic area as early as day 1 after MCAO appearing as a softening of cerebral tissue whose local internal elasticity decreased continuously from day 1 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that hyperperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is due to formation of neovessels, and indicate that brain softening is an early and continuous process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SWI is a promising novel imaging method for monitoring the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> over time in animals </plain></SENT>
