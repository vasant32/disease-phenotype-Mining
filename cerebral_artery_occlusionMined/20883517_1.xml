<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> decomposition catalyst on MMP activation and neurovascular reperfusion injury, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-disulfonatophenyl)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> iron (III) (FeTMPyP) was administered intravenously 30â€ƒmin prior to reperfusion following a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of MMP was assessed by in situ and gel zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurovascular injury was assessed using endothelial barrier antigen, collagen IV immunohistochemistry and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">Cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with sham and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> alone groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that administration of FeTMPyP just before reperfusion after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> inhibited MMP-9 activation and total MMP-2 increases in the cortex and decreased active MMP-9 along with the total amounts of active MMP-9 and active MMP-2 in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion-induced injury to the basal lamina of collagen IV-immunopositive microvasculature and neural cells in cortex and striatum was ameliorated by FeTMPyP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Losses of blood vessel endothelium produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or reperfusion were also decreased in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that administration of FeTMPy prior to reperfusion decreases MMP activation and neurovascular injury after prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This strategy may be useful for future therapies targeted at preventing breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
