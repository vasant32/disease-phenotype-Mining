<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish a new macrophotographic measurement of brain surface area to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed 10,30 min,1,3,6,12 and 24 h after MCAO, and photographed in dorsal and lateral views by a digital camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, 6 coronal slices of 1 mm thick were cut and photographed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the water content of brain tissue was measured by heating at 110 degrees C for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left and right hemisphere areas of the brains and the brain slices were analyzed and calculated by MedBrain 2 imaging analyzer to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The macrophotographic measurement showed that the ischemic hemisphere areas significantly increased from 1 h after focal cerebral ischmia, which was similar to the measurement of water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This measurement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> correlated well with those of water content and brain slice volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The macrophotographic measurement is an objective and quantitative method for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
