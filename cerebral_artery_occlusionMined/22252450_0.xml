<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) delivery was investigated in the postischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Florescence-tagged siRNA was found in the cytoplasm and processes of neurons and of glial cells in many brain regions, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, and striatum, in 1 hour after infusion, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-fluorescence was continuously detected for at least 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When siRNA for high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which functions as an endogenous danger molecule and aggravates <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, was delivered intranasally, the target gene was significantly depleted in many brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More importantly, intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA markedly suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the postischemic rat brain (maximal reduction to 42.8 Â± 5.6% at 48 hours after 60 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)) and this protective effect was manifested by recoveries from neurological and behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA offers an efficient means of gene knockdown-mediated therapy in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
