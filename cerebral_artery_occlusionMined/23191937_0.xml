<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the time window for application of limb RIPostC and the mechanisms behind RIPostC are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In this study, we investigated the protective efficacy and the role of autophagy in limb RIPostC using a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Limb RIPostC applied in the early phase of reperfusion reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autophagy levels in penumbral tissues were elevated in neurons of limb RIPostC rats, with an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blocking the AKT/GSK3β pathway via the AKT inhibitor LY294002 prior to limb RIPostC suppressed the RIPostC-induced autophagy and resulted in the activation of caspase-3 in RIPostC rats, suggesting a critical role for AKT/GSK3β-dependent autophagy in reducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results aid optimization of the time window for RIPostC use and offer novel insight into, and a better understanding of, the protective mechanism of autophagy in limb RIPostC </plain></SENT>
