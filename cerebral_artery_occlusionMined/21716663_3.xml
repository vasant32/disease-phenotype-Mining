<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanism of hypothermic suppression of ICAM-1 in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were kept at 37°C or 33°C during occlusion and rewarmed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> temperature immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under hypothermic condition, robust activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) was observed in vascular endothelium of ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic suppression of ICAM-1 was reversed by ERK1/2 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in ischemic vessel was attenuated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STAT3 inhibitor suppressed ICAM-1 production induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ERK1/2 inhibition enhanced phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT3 in hypothermic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that hypothermic suppression of ICAM-1 induction is mediated by enhanced ERK1/2 activation and subsequent attenuation of STAT3 action </plain></SENT>
