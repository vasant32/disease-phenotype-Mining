<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized with 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, and the middle cerebral artery was occluded via a subtemporal craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately thereafter, in one group (n = 9) arterial blood pressure was increased 30-35 mm Hg above the preocclusion level by intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second, control, group (n = 10) there was no manipulation of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was determined autoradiographically 15 minutes after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The areas (expressed as a percentage of the total coronal cross-sectional area) in which local cerebral blood flow decreased to three ranges (0-6 ml/100 g/min [rapid neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> probable], 6-15 ml/100 g/min [delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> probable], and 15-23 ml/100 g/min [electrophysiologic dysfunction with prolonged survival probable]) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas in which local cerebral blood flow decreased to the two more severely ischemic ranges were smaller in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, in the coronal section in the center of the middle cerebral artery distribution, local cerebral blood flow was 0-6 ml/100 g/min in 6.7 +/- 1.4% of the section in normotensive rats but was in that range in only 1.7 +/- 0.6% of the section during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 6-15 ml/100 g/min range, the areas were 6.8 +/- 0.8% and 3.8 +/- 0.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the 15-23 ml/100 g/min range, there were no differences between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
