<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat cerebral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion model after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was made by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 3H-QNB as radioligand, after binding with M receptor on the brain slice of the rat model, the brain samples were exposed on the hypersensitive film [H-3] to complete autoradiography, and the density of M receptor in different areas on the film of autoradiography was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no changes in the M receptor density in 2 hours' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> group and 2 hours' reperfusion group, M receptor densities in the area of occipital cortex (OC) and temporal cortex (TC) were observed to decrease significantly in 8 hours' reperfusion group, but the degree of decrease was lower than 24 hours' and 72 hours' reperfusion groups, there was significant decrease in the density of M receptor in the areas of caudate putamen (CP), frontal cortex (FC), TC, OC of the 24 hours' and 72 hours' reperfusion groups and no difference was found between these two groups, and the imaging of M receptor in the domains with decreased receptor was obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of M receptor did not change right after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It decreased gradually after an interval of time; Imaging of the M receptor could assess the changes of the density of viable cholinergic neurons and be a marker of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
