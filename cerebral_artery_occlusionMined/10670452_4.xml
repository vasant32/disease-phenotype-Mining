<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize molecular events that precede cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to measure levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor subunit 1 (GluR1), GluR2, GluR3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor subunit 1 (NR1) and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> in adult rats at various recirculation times (1.5, 3 and 24 h) following a 90-min period of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1.5 and 3 h recirculation, autoradiography showed pronounced but differential decreases in AMPA, NR1 and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression throughout the infarcted ipsilateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-uniform patterns of in situ hybridization grains emerged such that many striatal neurons were depleted of AMPA and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi>, while others retained control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cortical regions destined to undergo infarction, GluR2 and NR1 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> were preferentially reduced relative to the contralateral side (to 75+/-8.5% and 66+/-4.5%, respectively); GluR1, GluR3 and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> were unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h recirculation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of striatal and cortical <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> became less selective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GluR3 and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> were up-regulated in ipsilateral spared regions of the striatum, and GluR1 and GluR2 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> increased bilaterally in the cingulate cortex and in selective nuclei of the amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> was not detected in areas of reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression in either the ipsilateral striatum or cortex before 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that complex and long-lasting decreases in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression occur prior to significant cell loss in regions destined to undergo infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-permeable AMPA receptor assemblies may occur in "unspared" and "spared" regions via different mechanisms and contribute to alterations in post-ischemic synaptic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possibility arises that there may be altered relationships between glutamatergic and enkephalin synapses, since the dorsolateral striatum, where preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression is acutely reduced, receives innervation by the affected ipsilateral cortical region </plain></SENT>
