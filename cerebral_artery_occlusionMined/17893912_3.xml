<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine whether endogenous neurogenesis and neovascularization occur in the neocortex of the ischemic rat brain after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups (n = 29): one control group (n = 4) and five groups composed of animals sacrificed at increasing times post-MCAO (2 days and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; n = 5 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the presence of neurogenesis and neovascularization in the ischemic brain, nestin, Tuj1, NeuN, GFAP, Tie2, RECA, and 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were analyzed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, nestin, GFAP, and Tie2 expression was determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triple-labeling of nestin, BrdU, and laminin was performed to visualize the interaction between endogenous neurogenesis and neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of BrdU- and nestin-colabeled cells increased markedly in the neocortex and border zone of the ischemic area up to 1 week after MCAO and decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of nestin, Tie-2, and GFAP was amplified in the ipsilateral hemisphere 2 days after MCAO and peaked 1 week after MCAO, compared with that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After ischemic injury, nestin- and BrdU-colabeled cells were observed in the vicinity of the endothelial cells lining cerebral vessels in the ipsilateral neocortex of the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endogenous neurogenesis and neovascularization were substantially activated and occurred in close proximity to one other in the ipsilateral neocortex of the ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
