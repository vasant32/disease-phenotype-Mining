<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro data suggest a duty cycle dependence of sonothrombolytic efficacy of low-frequency applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine its impact on safety issues in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to transcranial 60-kHz ultrasound with varied duty cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine effects on the inner ear, the acoustic threshold was determined in additional healthy animals (acoustic evoked potentials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short duty cycle (20%) resulted in significant adverse effects (ischemic volume, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, functional outcome), which was not observed in longer duty cycle (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous-wave insonation produced high rates of mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hearing was impaired independent of duty cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cerebral side effects may be efficiently reduced by modulation of pulsed parameters, which is in line with data on an improved efficacy with longer duty cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, side effects on the auditory system were found to be independent of parameter settings </plain></SENT>
