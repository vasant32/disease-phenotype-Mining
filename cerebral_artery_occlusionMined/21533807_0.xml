<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) procedure was used to induce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were assigned to control or HBO group after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> after HBO treatment, another group of brain ischemic rats were included to receive the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor and HBO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HBO was administered at a pressure of 3 atmospheres absolute for 1 h with 100% oxygen, starting at 3 h post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in HBO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals in control group were placed in their home cage and exposed to normobaric room air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (IV), activation of astrocyte, and level of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LP) were assessed 24 h post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in IV was noted in HBO group when compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of astrocyte was significantly increased in the right cerebral cortex and right striatum in the HBO group when compared with those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> level was higher with lower LP level in right cortex and right striatum after HBO as compared with those of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, such effects of HBO treatment were markedly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results show that inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> synthesis dramatically reduces the effectiveness of HBO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
