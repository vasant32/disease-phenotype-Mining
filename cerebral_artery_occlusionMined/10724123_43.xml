<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a multisubunit transcription factor that when activated induces the expression of genes encoding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, cell surface receptors, and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB is composed of a variety of protein subunits of which p50-and p65-kDa (RelA) are the most widely studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under resting conditions, these subunits reside in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound by inhibitor proteins, IkappaB alpha and IkappaB beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On activation, IkappaB is phosphorylated by IkappaB kinase and ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome; simultaneously, the active heterodimer translocates to the nucleus where it can initiate gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the periphery, NF-kappaB is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> through stimulation of the production of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of NF-kappaB in the brain is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, NF-kappaB activation can be either protective or deleterious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of NF-kappaB in ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vivo was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were subjected to 2 hours of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 2, 6, and 12 hours after reperfusion, the expression and transactivation of NF-kappaB in ischemic versus nonischemic cortex and striatum were determined by immunocytochemistry and by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points studied, p50 and p65 immunoreactivity was found exclusively in the nuclei of cortical and striatal neurons in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The contralateral nonischemic hemisphere showed no evidence of nuclear NF-kappaB immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence confirmed expression of p50 in nuclei of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Increased NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from the ischemic hemisphere was further substantiated by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because the activation of NF-kappaB by many stimuli can be blocked by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in vitro, the effect of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, LY341122, previously shown to be neuroprotective, on NF-kappaB activation in the MCAO model was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No significant activation of NF-kappaB was found by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis in animals treated with LY341122 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> results in activation of NF-kappaB in neurons and supports previous observations that neuroprotective <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> may inhibit neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by preventing the activation of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
