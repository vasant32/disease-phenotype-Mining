<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inspired from preconditioning studies, ischemic postconditioning, consisting of the application of intermittent interruptions of blood flow shortly after reperfusion, has been described in <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> and recently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that ischemic tolerance can be achieved in the brain not only by ischemic preconditioning, but also by hypoxic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the existence of hypoxic postconditioning has never been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> starting either 1 or 5 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and brain damage was assessed by T2-weighted MRI at 43 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> applied after oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in primary neuronal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present study shows for the first time that a late application of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (5 days) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reduced delayed thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> performed 14 hours after oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation induced neuroprotection in primary neuronal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha expression as well as those of its target genes erythropoietin and adrenomedullin is increased by hypoxic postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies with pharmacological inhibitors or recombinant proteins for erythropoietin and adrenomedullin revealed that these molecules participate in this <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> postconditioning-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this study demonstrates for the first time the existence of a delayed hypoxic postconditioning in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in vitro studies highlight <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha and its target genes, erythropoietin and adrenomedullin, as potential effectors of postconditioning </plain></SENT>
