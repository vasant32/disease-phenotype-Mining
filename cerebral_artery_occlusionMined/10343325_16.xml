<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To differentiate between these opposing effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, the vascular territory of the two strains was correlated with the hemodynamic, metabolic, and morphological consequences of permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was studied by latex infusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by vital staining, the size of the ischemic penumbra by imaging of ATP and protein synthesis, and blood flow by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In C57Black/6 mice the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-supplied vascular territory and the size of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly larger than in SV129 mice but the size of the penumbra and the residual blood flow in the center of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-supplying territory were similar in both strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in C57Black/6 and SV129 mice are determined mainly by the vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and not by differences in collateral vascular responsiveness or excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
