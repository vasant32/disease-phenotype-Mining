<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The base-excision repair (BER) pathway is the main mechanism employed by neurons to repair various types of oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that the cellular activity of BER is highly regulated (up- or down-regulated) after ischemic brain injury, and this regulation may contribute to the outcome of cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism through which cellular BER is regulated in response to neuronal injury is currently poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have examined BER regulation in the rat model of focal ischemic brain injury induced by 2 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 0-72 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As determined using cerebral nuclear extracts, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in a marked reduction in BER activities, including the overall BER activity, AP endonuclease activity and DNA polymerase-beta activity, indicating functional impairment of the BER pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BER reduction occurred as early as 0.5 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, BER activity failed to recover, and there were persistent accumulations of apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic sites and DNA single-strand breaks in ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in BER during the early reperfusion phase (less than 6 hr) was not accompanied by any alterations in the levels of essential BER enzymes in brain extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, increased serine- and threonine-specific phosphorylation was detected for both AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase-beta after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with the time course of serine phosphorylation closely correlated to that of changes in BER activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase largely restored AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase-beta activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of the neuroprotective effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C), which was induced in the brain during the first 2 hr of reperfusion, we found that the post-ischemic suppression of BER activity is a reversible event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic treatment diminished the serine-specific phosphorylation of AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase-beta, promoted BER activities, and attenuated the levels of oxidative DNA lesions after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the functional impairment of the BER pathway after severe focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is due to the loss-of-function post-translational modifications of repair enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigations elucidating the precise mechanism underlying the post-translational regulation of BER enzymes may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
