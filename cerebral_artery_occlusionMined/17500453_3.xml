<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was developed for in vivo SPECT/CT imaging using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was verified in ex vivo studies using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo radionuclide imaging of cerebral blood flow was performed in rats following MCAO using dynamic planar imaging of 99mTc-exametazime with parallel hole collimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was followed immediately by in vivo radionuclide imaging of cerebral blood flow with 99mTc-exametazime in the same animals using 1-mm pinhole SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlated computed tomography imaging was performed to localize radiopharmaceutical uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were allowed to recover and ex vivo autoradiography was performed with separate administration of 99mTc-exametazime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time activity curve of 99mTc-exametazime showed that the radiopharmaceutical uptake could be maintained for over 9 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activity would be expected to be relatively stable for a much longer period, although the data were only obtained for 9 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TTC staining revealed sizable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by visual observation of inexistence of TTC stain in infracted tissues of MCAO rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo SPECT imaging showed cerebral blood flow deficit in the MCAO model, and the in vivo imaging result was confirmed with ex vivo autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated a capability of imaging regions of cerebral blood flow deficit in MCAO rat brains in vivo using a pinhole SPECT dedicated to small animal imaging </plain></SENT>
