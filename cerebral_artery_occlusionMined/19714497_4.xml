<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Animals subjected to an inflammatory insult with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are predisposed to develop a detrimental <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to myelin basic protein (MBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine whether other inflammatory stimuli could similarly invoke central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and whether these detrimental <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp> occurred to antigens other than MBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats underwent 3 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and received intraperitoneal injections of LPS, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or saline at the time of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were performed at set time intervals after MCAO and animals were sacrificed at 1 month to analyze the immune response to MBP, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and proteolipid protein (PLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphocytes from SEB treated animals were highly reactive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> antigens, but treatment with LPS was most likely to lead to a TH: 1(+) response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A TH: 1(+) response to MBP, NSE or PLP in spleen was associated with worse outcome, although the response to NSE was most predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals with a cell mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to either MBP or NSE in spleen had a concomitant humoral response to these antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that LPS, but not other inflammatory stimuli, increase the likelihood of developing a detrimental <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to an array of brain antigens </plain></SENT>
