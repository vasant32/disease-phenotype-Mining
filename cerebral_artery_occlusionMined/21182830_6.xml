<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of IpostC on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological function in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second aim was to determine the involvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ATP-dependent channel (mitoK(ATP)) opening and its capacity to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to 60min MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postconditioning was performed by 3 cycles of 30-s occlusion-reperfusion at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three behavioral tests were performed following 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Involvement of mitoK(ATP) was determined by the modulation of IpostC effects by 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function after 24h of reperfusion on isolated mitochondria was assessed through <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and calcium retention capacity to evaluate impact of IpostC on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IpostC resulted in a 40% decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects were lost when IpostC was delayed by 5min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> resulted in a 60% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of IpostC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> were blocked by 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> also blocked the inhibition of MPTP opening by IpostC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hyperpolarization induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion was corrected by IpostC without any effect on oxidative phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results confirm ischemic postconditioning-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They also support the involvement of mitoK(ATP) opening and its role in inhibiting the opening of MTPT induced by postconditioning </plain></SENT>
