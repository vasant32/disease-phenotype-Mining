<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated modest elevations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of these receptors in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a similar model system for both mice and rats, we report markedly different patterns of anaphylatoxin receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C5a receptor expression was dramatically elevated within 3 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, while C3aR expression was reduced to 25% of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 24 h post-occlusion, expression of both receptors was higher than at any other time point examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increased expression at late time points after occlusion is most likely the result of massive infiltration of leukocytes expressing the receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed increased receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in sham-operated animals, indicating that the procedures used for <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> affects mechanisms regulating receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter result highlights the importance of including this important control group in ischemic model systems for proper interpretation of changes in gene expression </plain></SENT>
