<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to compare the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> on blood-brain barrier disruption in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> between younger and older rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Younger (three-month-old) and older (24-month-old) ovariectomized female Fischer 344 rats were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one half of each age group, a 500 microg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> 21-day release pellet and in another half, a vehicle pellet was implanted 21 days before the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the transfer coefficient (Ki) of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> and the volume of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> distribution were determined to examine the degree of blood-brain barrier disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups, the Ki in the ischemic cortex was higher than in the corresponding contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the Ki in both cortices among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> distribution of the ischemic cortex was only greater than in the corresponding contralateral cortex in the older <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated group, and the volume of that group was greater than the younger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated group (4.00 +/- 1.29 VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2.13 +/- 0.88 ml/100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After analyzing the difference in Ki between the ischemic cortex and the contralateral cortex in each animal, the difference was significantly greater in the older <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated rats than the older vehicle-treated rats (3.40 +/- 2.10 VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1.26 +/- 1.44 microl/g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the younger rats, however, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> did not significantly affect the difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> treatment failed to attenuate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in the cerebral ischemic cortex in the older or younger Fischer 344 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, our data also suggest the possibility that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> could aggravate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in older rats </plain></SENT>
