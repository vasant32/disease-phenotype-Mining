<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this molecule as a marker of plastic change in neurons, we investigated its temporal expression in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In sham-control brain, only subependymal neurons showed a positive immunoreactivity for PSA-NCAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 90 min of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, neurons in the piriform cortex began to be positively stained at 1 h, while neurons in the cortex and caudate of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory became positive after 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stainings persisted for 1 and 3 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that neurons in the cerebral cortex and caudate have the capability of plastic change in the adult brain, and that those in the piriform cortex rapidly undergo plastic change probably in response to transneuronal injury </plain></SENT>
