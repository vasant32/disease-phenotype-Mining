<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Picroside II (10 mg/kg) was administered intravenously into the tail vein of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological function deficits were evaluated with the Bederson's test and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was visualized with tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic cells were counted by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry stain and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the expressions of caspase-3 and PARP in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that rats in the control group showed neurological function deficit and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in ischemic hemisphere after two hours <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 22 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 and PARP expressions were also profound in the cortex, the striatum and the hippocampus, along with increased apoptotic cells in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bederson's score, infarction volume, and expressions of caspase-3 and PARP, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the treatment group were, however, significantly decreased compared to those in the control group indicating that intravenous treatment with picroside II might be beneficial to inhibit neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and, thus, to improve the neurological function of rats upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
