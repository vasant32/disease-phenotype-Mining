<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 42 SD rats were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group undergoing MCAO by intraluminal thread technique so as to cause focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, sham operation group, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group.19 and 28 days after the operation 6 rats in each group were killed with their hippocampus taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Notch(1) and Jagged(1) in hippocampus were assayed respectively by Western blotting and real-time reverse-transcription PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Notch(1) on the 19th day of the MCAO group were up-regulated, both significantly higher than those of the sham operation and control groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Notch(1) on the 28th day of the MCAO group were both significantly lower than those of the same group on the 19th day (both P &lt; 0.01), and were lower than those of the sham operation and control groups on the 28th day, however, not significantly (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Jagged(1) on the 19th and 28th days of the MCAO group were significantly higher than those of the sham and control groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), however, there were not significant differences in the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Jagged(1) on the 19th and 28th days of the MCAO group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The protein and gene expression of Notch(1) and Jagged(1) vary dynamically in the hippocampus of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which suggests that the Notch pathway may be a potential mechanism in the regulation of the neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
