<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether there are any changes in cell damage after a short-term middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) when glial metabolism is suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injection of fluorocitrate (FC) or 10 minutes MCAO alone did not produce cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, 10 minutes MCAO in rats pretreated with FC caused significant cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data directly demonstrated that inhibition of glial metabolism might increase neuronal vulnerability to even a short-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
