<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived bioactive protein, provides vascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical studies have suggested that plasma adiponectin plays a role in cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine the serial changes in adiponectin expression in the brain and plasma after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice (n=100) were subjected to 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h and 7-day reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA kit, and expression of adiponectin was assessed by immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury resulted in a transient rise in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and decrease in the late phase, in plasma adiponectin levels (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same insult resulted in upregulation of adiponectin expression, with two peaks at 3 and 24 h after reperfusion (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin protein was negligible in nonischemic contralateral hemispheres, but relatively high levels of the protein were detected in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in neither nonischemic nor ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin accumulated only in endothelial cells of ischemic brain in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ischemic insult results in a transient rise in plasma adiponectin level during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, and that circulating adiponectin then accumulates in damaged vessels in the ischemic brain during the late phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that time-targeting administration of adiponectin could be potentially useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
