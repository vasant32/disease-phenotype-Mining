<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have assessed whether degeneration of the substantia nigra is accompanied by changes in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>Neuronal loss</z:hpo> was assessed by neuronal nuclei (NeuN) immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of Bcl-2 expression was observed in the substantia nigra 12, 24 and 72 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the substantia nigra could be related with the modification of proteins regulating programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exo-focal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may explain the appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms that are not correlated with the primary site of lesion </plain></SENT>
