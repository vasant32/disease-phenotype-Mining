<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies in neonatal rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models suggest that recovery is due in part to upregulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1-a and its downstream target, vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor is upregulated after a hypoxic insult and is involved in neuronal survival, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and neurogenesis during the recovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a 1.5-hour transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 10-day-old rats with injury verified by diffusion-weighted MRI during occlusion to determine the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) inhibition on injury, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days after reperfusion, the pups received either the VEGFR inhibitor, SU5416 (10 mg/kg per dose) or vehicle (1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>) for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGFR2 inhibition worsened injury 7 days after injury when compared with the vehicle-treated and injury-alone groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, receptor inhibition was associated with increased VEGFR2 expression 5 days after injury (P&lt;0.05) and increased spectrin cleavage with a shift in favor of the calpain-mediated, caspase-3-independent cleavage (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased areas of cleaved caspase-3 staining were seen in treated rats at 7 days (P&lt;0.01) There were no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> or macrophage recruitment as measured by glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba-1 expression at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, VEGFR2 inhibition did not affect the overall vessel surface area but reduced endothelial cell proliferation in injured caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling worsens injury, affects cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and reduces endothelial cell proliferation after neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Injury exacerbation may be in part due to a shift of cell fate from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> on the continuum spectrum of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
