<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LCBF hydrogen electrodes were implanted in cortical regions where MCAO had been previously shown to produce severe and penumbral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and in posterior regions where blood flow is not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolites were assayed in small tissue samples collected either by cryoprobe biopsy in the regions where LCBFs were measured (series 1) or by sampling appropriate regions of the rapidly frozen brain (series 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent topographical study of brain tissue pH with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27510">umbelliferone</z:chebi> was performed in this latter series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from these two series are compared and discussed in terms of the more appropriate way to perform simultaneous electrode measurements and analysis of tissue samples for studying focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the primate brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They confirm that the concentrations of ATP and PCr decrease, and that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level increases, with decreasing blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These metabolites tended to change more rapidly below a blood flow threshold, rather than showing a steady decrease as the blood flow was reduced, although the variability of the data precluded us from establishing this with confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topographical study of tissue pH often showed sharp boundaries between zones of very low pH and regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH </plain></SENT>
