<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, MSCs were intravenously administered 6hours after right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induction in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional MRI (fMRI) during electrical stimulation of the left forepaw and behavioral testing (treadmill stress test) were carried out at day 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the medium infused group (n=20) electrical stimulation of the left forepaw elicited a unilateral (right cortex) activated signal detected by fMRI in the infarcted somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MSC infused animals two fMRI patterns were observed: unilateral (n=17) and bilateral (n=19) activation of sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the MSC group both unilateral and bilateral cortical activated animals displayed significantly improved motor function compared to the medium infused group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the bilateral activated pattern in the MSC group showed the greatest functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume as calculated from high intensity signals using T2WI was less in the MSC groups as compared to the medium group, but the lesion volume for the unilateral and bilateral signals in the MSC group was the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the presence of a bilateral signal in sensorimotor cortex as detected by fMRI was more predictive of improved functional outcome than lesion volume alone </plain></SENT>
