<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in resisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury (CI-RI) via anti-oxidation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (MT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 52 male SD rats were randomized into Sham-operation (sham, n=8), CI-RI (model, n=8), EA (n=8), MT (3.2 mg/Kg, i.p., n=8), EA+MT (n=8), EA+Luzindole (L, a blocker of MT, 1 mg/100 microl/rat, n=6), EA+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> 98059 (a blocker of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, MAPK, 1 mg 100 microl/rat, n=6) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EA (3 Hz,1-3 mA, continuous waves) was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14) and "Baihui" (GV 20) for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CI-RI model was induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 60 min and reperfusion for 24 h except sham-operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MT content of pineal gland tissue was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and neuroethological scores of the rats were evaluated by Kuluz's and Julio's methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bax and Bcl-2 gene protein expression of the striate body was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with sham group, the number of Bax immunoreactive (IR) positive cells and Bax/Bcl-2 in striate body increased significantly (P&lt;0.001), and neuroethological score and Bcl-2 IR-positive cells decreased considerably in model group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, pineal MT content, neuroethological score and Bcl-2 IR-positive cells in EA group, neuroethological scores in EA+L and EA+P groups, and Bcl-2 expression in MT and EA+MT groups increased considerably (P&lt;0.01, 0.001); while Bax IR-positive cells and Bax/Bcl-2 in EA, MT and EA+MT groups decreased very significantly (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It showed that EA could obviously increase pineal MT content, improve CI-RI rats' activity score, upregulate Bcl-2 expression and down-regulate Bax expression in striate body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison with simple EA group, neuroethological scores of EA+L and EA+P groups, Bax IR-positive cells and Bax/Bcl-2 of EA+MT group were significant lower (P&lt;0.05, 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between EA+L and EA+P groups in behavior scores, and between MT and EA+MT groups in Bax and Bcl-2 IR-positive cell number and Bax/Bcl-2 (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA has a good effect of anti-oxygen stress, protecting the brain from ischemic damage directly or indirectly, which may be related to its effect in upregulating the synthesis and release of MT </plain></SENT>
