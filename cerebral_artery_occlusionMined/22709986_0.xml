<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2α) and its receptor (FP) are not clear in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that this G-protein coupled receptor has been linked to intracellular calcium regulation, we hypothesized that its blockade would be protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used FP <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (AL-8810) and FP receptor knockout (FP(-/-)) mice in in vivo and in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice that were treated with AL-8810 had 35.7±6.3% less neurologic dysfunction and 36.4±6.0% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than did vehicle-treated mice after 48h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO); FP(-/-) mice also had improved outcomes after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blockade of the FP receptor also protected against oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and reactive oxygen species formation in slice cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that an FP receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> dose dependently increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels in cultured neurons and established that FP-related Ca(2+) signaling is related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the FP receptor is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced damage and could promote development of drugs for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
