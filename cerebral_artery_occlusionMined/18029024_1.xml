<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate a modified method of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected randomly to reperfusion series (n=30) with 3 h of MCAo followed by 69 h of reperfusion and permanent series (n=20) with 24 h of MCAo only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on Longa's method, experimental group with ligation of the distal branch of the internal carotid artery (ICA) around the intraluminal suture and control group without ligation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Behavioral functions were evaluated at 3 h after occlusion and during a 3-day period after MCAo in reperfusion series, or at 3 and 24 h after occlusion in permanent series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume (IFV) was measured by the 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) method at end time point in each series, and intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in ICA of the reperfusion series was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the experimental groups, a 100% incidence of infarction was shown in two series which was significantly higher than that in the control group (40% in reperfusion series and 50% in permanent series, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total IFV and subcortical IFV in the experimental group was 174.9+/-6.2 and 101.8+/-2.6 mm3 in reperfusion series and 321.8+/-4.2 and 191.6+/-7.5 mm3 in permanent series, respectively, significantly larger than that in the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the coefficient of variation of total IFV and subcortical IFV in the experimental group was dramatically smaller than that in the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats in the experimental groups were more severely impaired on neurobehavioral tests than that in the control groups (p&lt;0.05), and showed longer duration of neurological deficits and slower recovery of functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or clot was observed in ICA of the reperfusion series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversible MCAo with ligation of the distal branch of ICA is proven to be a reliable and effective method with which consistently larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> including subcortex lesions is yielded </plain></SENT>
