<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential beneficial effects of onion extract on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible underlying mechanisms are investigated, especially those linked to the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effects of the onion extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated intravenously with onion extract 30 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> hyperpermeability were evaluated by the measurement of the brain water content and Evans blue extravasation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disruption of tight junction proteins was examined by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of malondialdehyde was determined using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and catalase were determined by spectrophotometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain water content in the ischemic hemisphere was significantly reduced by treatment with onion extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Onion extract also had a significant effect on both the decrease in Evans blue extravasation and the inhibition of zonula occludens-1 and occludin disruption caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, onion extract significantly prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-induced reduction in catalase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activities and elevation of malondialdehyde level in the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from this study demonstrate that onion extract prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> hyperpermeability, and tight junction proteins disruption, possibly through its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effects in the mouse MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that onion extract may be a beneficial nutrient for the prevention of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
