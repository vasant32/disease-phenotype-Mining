<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine whether the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> (PGs) pathway is involved in triggering delayed neuroprotection by ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) and evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> was induced by 10 min of saline infusion into the left internal carotid artery with the right common carotid artery clamped at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion model was produced using intraluminal filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> 48 h prior to MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as compared with MCAO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nonselective inhibitor of COX <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg, ip) applied 1 h prior to or 1 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> failed to affect its protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> had no direct effect on the cortex COX-2 mRNA and protein expression 72 h later, but decreased the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PGs pathways was not involved in triggering delayed neuroprotection by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> induced down-regulation of COX-2 following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion in rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
