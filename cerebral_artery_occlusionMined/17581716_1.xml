<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> within 4.5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the processed images with the noise reduction filter and that of original images were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists visually rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the processed and original images on the visibility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal gray-white matter interfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNR value of the processed images was approximately eight times as high as that of the original images, and a 87% reduction of noise was achieved using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the visual assessment, the results showed that the visibility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gray-white matter interface and that of the loss of the gray-white matter interface were significantly improved using the proposed method (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The noise reduction filter proposed in the present study has the potential to improve the visibility of early CT signs of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on nonenhanced CT images </plain></SENT>
