<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> on the proliferation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of rats after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An adult rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established by placement of an intraluminal filament at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally in the rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg every 3 days starting at 6 h after MCAO, and BrdU (50 mg/kg daily) was also injected intraperitoneally starting at 4 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ were counted at 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operated group, the rats in the ischemic model group showed significantly increased BrdU-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ 7 days after MCAO, reaching the peak level on day 14 and beginning to decrease on day 21 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of ipsilateral BrdU-positive cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> group was significantly greater than that in the model group on days 7, 14 and 21 (P&lt;0.05), and maintained the high level on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> can maintain a high level of neural stem cell proliferation in the SVZ after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
