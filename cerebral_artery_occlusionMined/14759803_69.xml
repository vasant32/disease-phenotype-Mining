<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Examination of the clinical therapeutic efficacy of using bone marrow stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), has recently been the focus of much investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSC were reported to ameliorate functional deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats, with some of this improvement possibly resulting from the action of cytokines secreted by these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To enhance such cytokine effects, we transfected telomerized human MSC with the BDNF gene using a fiber-mutant F/RGD adenovirus vector and investigated whether these cells contributed to improved functional recovery in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BDNF production by MSC-BDNF cells was 23-fold greater than that seen in uninfected MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats that received MSC-BDNF showed significantly more functional recovery than did control rats following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, MRI analysis revealed that the rats in the MSC-BDNF group exhibited more significant recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after 7 and 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic boundary zone was significantly smaller in animals treated with MSC-BDNF compared to animals in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that MSC transfected with the BDNF gene may be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may represent a new strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
