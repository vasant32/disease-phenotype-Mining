<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether thalidomide might inhibit the neuronal damage resulting from focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and if so to explore the neuroprotective mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice, and thalidomide was intraperitoneally administered a total of three times (at 10 min before, just before, and 1 h after MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide significantly reduced (a) the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and volume at 24 and 72 h after MCAO and (b) the neurological score at 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were also histochemically assessed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and an antibody recognizing 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide reduced both the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, post-treatment of thalidomide [20 mg/kg, three times (at just after, 1 h after, 3 h after MCAO)] did not reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro study, we examined the effects of thalidomide on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in mouse brain homogenates and on the production of various radical species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide inhibited both the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>.(-) (but not HO(-)) radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also measured the brain concentration of TNF-alpha by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha level in the brain was significantly increased at 9-24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, thalidomide did not reduce the elevated TNF-alpha level at either 12 or 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that thalidomide has neuroprotective effects against ischemic neuronal damage in mice, and that an inhibitory action of thalidomide against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be partly responsible for these neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
