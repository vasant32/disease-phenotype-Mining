<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Therapeutic application of diagnostic ultrasound has been shown to improve recanalization rates in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is experimental evidence that low-frequency ultrasound may be superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of low-frequency ultrasound in an embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A parameter setting was used that had not previously shown any side effects and interactions with healthy rat brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were submitted to middle cerebral artery clot embolism and transcranial treatment with 20-kHz continuous-wave ultrasound (0.2 W/cm(2)), either alone or in combination with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control groups received no treatment or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome assessment consisted of determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven animals treated with ultrasound died during the follow-up period of 7 days, compared with 2 animals in the control groups (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was detected (1 in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other animals that died displayed secondary worsening after an initial period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In surviving animals, no benefit of treatment could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 20-kHz continuous-wave ultrasound caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a significant number of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound at 20 kHz does not seem to be suitable for transcranial therapeutic cerebral application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The data underline the necessity to obtain further animal data to establish the safety limits of frequency and power output </plain></SENT>
