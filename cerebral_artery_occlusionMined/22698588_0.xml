<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are able to improve neuronal function through secretion of trophic factors in animal models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that incubation of BM-MSCs protects PC12 cells against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by CoCl(2) via the production of erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Addition of CoCl(2) to BM-MSCs cultures induced the expression of EPO in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, BM-MSCs co-culture protected PC12 cells against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by CoCl(2) in a ratio-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore whether expression of EPO induced by CoCl(2) is required for BM-MSCs-mediated cytoprotection, we transfected BM-MSCs with EPO small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knocking-down EPO abrogated increases in EPO expression induced by CoCl(2), and the cytoprotective effect of BM-MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results showed that EPO siRNA reversed upregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) expression and downregulation of Bax, Bak, caspase-9, and caspase-3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that the protective effect of BM-MSCs against PC12 cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by CoCl(2) might be dependent on EPO expression, at least in part, via the regulation of Bcl-2 family members and caspases </plain></SENT>
