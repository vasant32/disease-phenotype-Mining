<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have been shown to have neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clenbuterol, a beta(2)AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, was shown to have neuroprotective activity by increasing nerve growth factor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used beta(2)AR knockout mice and a beta(2) selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> to test the effect of loss of beta(2)ARs on outcome from transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by the intraluminal suture method, for 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological score was determined at 24 h reperfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> or 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta(2)AR knockout mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> congenic FVB/N controls were studied, as well as 2 groups of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice given either ICI 118,551 (0.2 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline intraperitoneally 30 min before MCAO (n = 10 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in expression of heat shock protein (Hsp)72 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were examined by immunohistochemistry and western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was decreased by 22.3% in beta(2)AR knockout mice (39.7 +/- 10.7 mm(3) vs 51.0 +/- 11.4 mm(3), n = 10/group, P = 0.034) after 60 min of MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with a beta(2)AR selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ICI 118,551, also decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size significantly, by 25.1%, compared with the saline control (32.8 +/- 11.9 mm(3) vs 43.8 +/- 10.3 mm(3), n = 10/group, P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were also significantly improved in mice lacking the beta(2)AR or pretreated with ICI 118,551 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, total levels of Hsp72 and the number of Hsp72 immunopositive cells were greater in mice lacking beta(2) AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain injury is reduced and neurological outcome improved after MCAO in mice lacking the beta(2)AR, or in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice pretreated with a selective beta(2)AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a shift away from prosurvival signaling to prodeath signaling in the presence of beta(2)AR activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Protection is associated with higher levels of Hsp72, a known antideath protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effect of beta(2)AR signaling in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is complex and warrants further study </plain></SENT>
