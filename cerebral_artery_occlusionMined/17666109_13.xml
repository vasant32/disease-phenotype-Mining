<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endogenous levels of the endocannabinoid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi>, and the activities of the synthesizing and hydrolyzing enzymes, i.e. N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D and fatty acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> hydrolase, respectively, were determined in the cortex and the striatum of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">Anandamide</z:chebi> content was markedly increased ( approximately 3-fold over controls; P &lt; 0.01) in the ischemic striatum after 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but not in the cortex, and this elevation was paralleled by increased activity of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D ( approximately 1.7-fold; P &lt; 0.01), and reduced activity ( approximately 0.6-fold; P &lt; 0.01) and expression ( approximately 0.7-fold; P &lt; 0.05) of fatty acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> hydrolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were further potentiated by 1 h of reperfusion, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> binding to type 1 cannabinoid and type 1 vanilloid receptors was not affected significantly by the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the cannabinoid type 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716, but not the receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> R-(+)-WIN55,212-2, significantly reduced (33%; P &lt; 0.05) cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume detected 22 h after the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neuroprotective intraperitoneal dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (0.20 mg x kg(-1)) that reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 43% also minimized the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> on the endocannabinoid system, in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we show that the endocannabinoid system is implicated in the pathophysiology of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced brain damage, and that neuroprotection afforded by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is coincident with a re-establishment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> levels in the ischemic striatum through a mechanism that needs to be investigated further </plain></SENT>
