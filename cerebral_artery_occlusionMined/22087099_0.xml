<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 4 cases presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> neurological deteriorations with selective axonal injury following reperfusion therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our case series based on 4 patients showed common features distinct from those of early reperfusion injury in that (1) the neurological symptoms developed after 1-2 months of reperfusion therapies, (2) these symptoms were accompanied by the subcortical white matter changes on brain MRI, and (3) these findings were mostly reversible with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that axons in the reperfused brain may be vulnerable to further neurological injury </plain></SENT>
