<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have established that in cerebral cortex subjected to progressive reduction in blood flow, two distinct thresholds of flow may be identified below which cellular function is impaired: the cortical evoked response loses amplitude when local flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> below 18ml/100gm/min, and below 11ml/100gm/min a major increase in extracellular K+ activity (Ke) occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, further evidence suggests that even at higher flows the capacity of the tissue to handle induced ionic changes may be impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this point, we studied the kinetics of resolution of Ke following a transient increase produced by local electrical stimulation, in relation to the local pre-stimulus flow (reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) in baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method and Ke by ion-exchanger micro-electrodes, in the same cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In primary induced transients (those increases in Ke elicited by cortical stimulation, and reported previously,) Ke attained a maximum value of 8-10 mM and then decayed towards the 4-mM baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The half-time of this decay was significantly increased from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the flow range 20-40 ml/100 gm/min, and increased further at lower flows until, below 11ml/100gm/min, Ke clearance was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, cortical ion homeostasis appeared impaired at flows substantially closer to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> than those thresholds mentioned above, a result discussed in terms of impairment of active Ke clearance mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary induced transients arose during a primary induced transient, reaching considerably higher peak values (8-30 mM) of Ke (indicating temporary clearance loss) and with slower decay rate than the primary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous transients, not associated with any stimulus, were also observed; like secondary transients, they occurred only at flows below 20ml/100gm/min and showed a reduction in clearance rate with progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They resemble spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and their generation is discussed in terms of the ionic and metabolic conditions at their time of origin </plain></SENT>
