<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether the Electroacupuncture (EA) is beneficial to extenuate cerebral injuries following transient Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), as well as to observe the effect of EA on expression of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) -like Immunoreactivity (IR) in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that gross neuronal damages include infarction, swelling and neuron loss, accompanied by increased bFGF-like IR expression following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> striatum, bFGF-like IR was mainly located in astrocytes except some neurons also showed an upregulation of the IR; in frontoparietal cortex, strong induction of bFGF-like IR was mostly seen in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the EA applied during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion could evidently alleviate cerebral lesion extent, notably upregulate the expression of bFGF-like IR in striatum and cortex, but there was no significant difference between the effects of EA applied during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, except EA applied during reperfusion seems to be more effective in reducing the cerebral swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results implied that, in striatum, astrocytes might play an important role in the protection of neuron via the expression of bFGF; whereas in cortex, neurons may exert autoprotection through secreting bFGF themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One possible protective effect of EA lies in regulating the endogenous expression of bFGF </plain></SENT>
