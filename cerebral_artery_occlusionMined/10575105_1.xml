<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using in situ hybridization, we measured tie 1 mRNA in ischemic brain (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by a single fibrin rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of tie 1 was not detected in non ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microvessels expressed tie 1 in the ischemic lesion as early as 2 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of microvessels containing tie 1 mRNA decreased in the ischemic lesion at 8 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, expression of tie 1 increased on microvessels at 24 h and 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and tie 1 was primarily localized to the microvessels bordering pan necrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent of cerebral vessels which expressed tie 1 mRNA had diameters of 3.7+/-0.17 microm </plain></SENT>
