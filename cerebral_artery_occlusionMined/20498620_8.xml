<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> is a unique AT1 receptor blocker with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonistic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of PPAR-gamma could prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We investigated the beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> on ischemic brain damage via PPAR-gamma activation as well as AT1 receptor blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old male KK-Ay mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, they were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, with or without GW9662, a PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic area, neurological score, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cerebral blood flow were assessed 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, GW9662 and these AT1 receptor blockers with GW9662 had no significant effect on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KK-Ay mice exhibited a significant increase in the ischemic area compared with C57BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> decreased the ischemic area and improved the neurological score compared with the no-treatment group, with an increase in cerebral blood flow and a reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production and expression of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> were partially attenuated by coadministration of GW9662, although GW9662 treatment alone had no significant effect on ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> treatment showed a reduction in ischemic area compared with nontreated KK-Ay mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, coadministration of GW9662 had no effect on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>-mediated reduction in ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> has a beneficial effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> partly due to activation of PPAR-gamma as well as AT1 receptor blockade </plain></SENT>
