<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms of GSK-3β inhibitor involving neuroprotection remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated that GSK-3β inhibitor suppressed insult-induced neuroinflammation in rat cortex by increasing autophagy activation in ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male rats were subjected to pMCAO (permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) followed by treating with SB216763, a GSK-3β inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that insult-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was significantly decreased by intraperitoneal infusion of SB216763 in rat cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher level of autophagy was also detected after SB216763 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cultured primary microglia, SB216763 activated autophagy and suppressed <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by Beclin1-siRNA <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> in the SB216763-treated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GSK-3β inhibitor suppressed neuroinflammation by activating autophagy after ischemic brain injury, thus offering a new target for prevention of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
