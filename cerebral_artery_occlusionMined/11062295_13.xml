<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both NO and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> cytotoxicity are important in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; however, it is unclear whether these molecules act within parallel pathological pathways or as coreagents in a common reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined these alternatives by comparing outcomes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male and female neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)-deficient (nNOS-/-) or human CuZn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase-overexpressing (hSOD1+/-) mice and a novel strain with both mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed by use of the intraluminal filament technique (18 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was scored, and tissue infarction volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemispheric infarction volume was reduced in each transgenic strain relative to the genetically matched, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, control cohorts (WT mice): nNOS-/- (80+/-6 mm(3)) and double-mutant (49+/-6 mm(3)) mice versus WT mice (114+/-7 mm(3)) and hSOD1+/- mice (52+/-7 mm(3)) versus WT mice (95+/-5 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human CuZn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase had a larger effect on mean infarction volume (30% of contralateral hemisphere) than did nNOS deficiency (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although infarction volume was less in double-mutant mice compared with nNOS-/- mice, injury was not improved relative to hSOD1+/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in histological damage by sex within each strain; however, female nNOS-/- mice were not protected from ischemic injury, unlike male mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> generation contributes to severe ischemic brain injury in vivo to a greater extent than does neuronally derived NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo, significant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging by CuZn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase occurs within cellular compartments or through biochemical pathways that are not restricted to, and may be distinct from, neuronal NO/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> reaction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
