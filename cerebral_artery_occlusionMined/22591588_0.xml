<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tissue type plasminogen activator is the only approved thrombolytic agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it carries the disadvantage of a 10-fold increase in symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A safer thrombolytic agent may improve patient prognosis and increase patient participation in thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel direct-acting thrombolytic agent, Δ(K2-K5) plasmin, promising an improved safety profile was examined for safety in the snare ligature model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to 6 hours middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 18 hours reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beginning 1 minute before reflow, they were dosed with saline, vehicle, Δ(K2-K5) plasmin (0.15, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg/kg) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (10 and 30 mg/kg) by local intra-arterial infusion lasting 10 to 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were assessed for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, modified Bederson score and general behavioral score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a parallel study, temporal progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro study, whole blood clots from humans, canines and rats were exposed to Δ(K2-K5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clot lysis was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main focus of this study was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> safety. Δ(K2-K5) plasmin treatment at the highest dose caused no more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> than the lowest dose of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator, but showed at least a 5-fold superior safety margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secondary results include: temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume progression shows that the greatest expansion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume occurs within 2-3 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the spontaneously hypertensive rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A spike in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed at 6 hours <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reflow. Δ(K2-K5) plasmin tended to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve behavior compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In vitro data suggests that Δ(K2-K5) plasmin is equally effective at lysing clots from humans, canines and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The superior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> safety profile of the direct-acting thrombolytic Δ(K2-K5) plasmin compared with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator makes this agent a good candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
