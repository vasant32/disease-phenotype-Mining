<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conducted vasomotor responses likely play an important role in cerebrovascular regulation, but it is unclear how these responses may be affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion (I/R) alters vascular conduction in cerebral arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced by an intraluminal filament technique in 4 groups of rats: (A) 2-hour MCAO/24-hour reperfusion (n=14); (B) 2-hour MCAO/1-hour reperfusion (n=7); (C) 1-hour MCAO/24-hour reperfusion (n=6); and (D) 1-hour MCAO/1-hour reperfusion (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological status and infarction (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining) were evaluated after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conducted vasomotor responses were assessed in intracerebral branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, by following the longitudinal spread of vasodilation or vasoconstriction to localized microapplication of ATP or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local microapplication of ATP evoked a biphasic constriction (17+/-3%) and dilation (7+/-2%) response, whereas <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> elicited only dilation (11+/-2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These local responses spread longitudinally along sham-control arterioles (1 mm conduction distance) with rapid spatial decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> followed by 24-hour reperfusion (groups A and C) led to a marked potentiation of conducted dilation responses: dilation to ATP conducted with virtually no decay in I/R arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Augmentation of conductivity was not observed in the 1-hour reperfusion groups (B and D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, I/R did not alter conducted constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion led to a specific augmentation of conducted vasodilation in cerebral arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presumably, enhanced conductivity may improve cerebral perfusion after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
