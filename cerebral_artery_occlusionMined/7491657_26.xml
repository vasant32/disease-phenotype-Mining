<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HU-211 is a nonpsychotropic cannabinoid analogue that has been shown to act as a functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of HU-211 in a model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 90 minutes of temporary MCAo by retrograde insertion of an intraluminal nylon suture, coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>, through the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug (HU-211 in cosolvent, 4 mg/kg IV) or vehicle was administered in a blinded fashion 70 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were evaluated during occlusion (60 minutes) and for a 3-day period after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after MCAo, brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HU-211 significantly improved the neurological score compared with vehicle during the 3 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with HU-211 also significantly reduced both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 66.6 +/- 12.5 versus 149.8 +/- 36.3 mm3) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> (2.61 +/- 1.33% versus 6.66 +/- 1.24%) compared with vehicle-treated rats (n = 17 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the neuroprotective ability of HU-211 in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as judged by neurological score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversible MCAo with the use of a poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal suture proved to be a reliable and effective modification of this technique, yielding consistent results </plain></SENT>
