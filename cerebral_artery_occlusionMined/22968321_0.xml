<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our present study, we investigated the temporal distribution, location, induction, and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the possible involvement of microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6J and Foxp3(EGFP) transgenic mice were subjected to 30â€‰minutes MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On days 7, 14, and 30 after MCAO, Tregs and antigen presenting cells were analyzed using fluorescence activated cell sorting multicolor staining and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong accumulation of Tregs was observed on days 14 and 30 in the ischemic hemisphere accompanied by the elevated presence and activation of microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells and macrophages were found on each analyzed day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 60% of Foxp3(+) Tregs in ischemic hemispheres were positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67 on days 7 and 14 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transfer of naive CD4(+) cells depleted of Foxp3(+) Tregs into RAG1(-/-) mice 1 day before MCAO did not lead to a de novo generation of Tregs 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD25(+) Tregs, no changes regarding neurologic outcome were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sustained presence of Tregs in the brain after MCAO indicates a long-lasting immunological alteration and involvement of brain cells in immunoregulatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
