<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1beta plays a crucial role in ischemic pathophysiology, since pharmacologic inhibition of its biological effects provides neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is evidence suggesting that under certain circumstances the cytokine may also exert beneficial functions on brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the regional and cellular expression of IL-1beta after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in the brain of rat, and correlated cytokine expression with the activation/recruitment of glial cells in the damaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using a double immunofluorescence histochemical approach, we observed an increased cytokine immunoreactivity in the ischemic core, as early as 1 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, in few activated OX-42-positive microglial cells and in perivascular GFAP-positive astrocytes, suggesting that the cytokine may participate in the early response of the neurovascular unit to reduced blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, followed by 2 h reperfusion, cytokine staining was evident in the astrocytes of the penumbra and in activated microglial cells of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microglial activation increases with the progression of damage and, after 22 h reperfusion, OX-42-immunopositive cells were strongly labelled for IL-1beta in the core and, even more intensely, in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this later stage, GFAP-positive cells, appearing hypertrophic and distributed in a ring-like pattern around the ischemic core, do no longer express IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a specific cellular and regional pattern of IL-1beta expression characterises the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depending on the stage and intensity of the insult, the different cellular origin of the cytokine may suggest a distinct role of this neuroinflammatory mediator in ischemic pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
