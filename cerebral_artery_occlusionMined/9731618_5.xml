<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the third leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clot-lysis drug tissue plasminogen activator is the only treatment that has been effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, yet there are significant limitations to its use and effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study retrograde transvenous neuroperfusion (RTN) was evaluated for its efficacy in reversing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, and limiting pathological evidence of infarction in baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten adult male baboons underwent 3.5 hours of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (0.25% to 1.5%) anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five randomly chosen animals received RTN treatment 1 hour after start of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded during MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were assigned daily neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 6 days after MCAO, and brains were quantitatively analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 1 hour after RTN was started, treated animals showed significantly improved somatosensory evoked potentials (103.3% versus 75% of baseline; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the combined neurological score for the RTN-treated group was 99.2, while the combined mean score for the untreated group was 66.4 (P&lt;0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean infarction volume was 8.8+/-3.1% (of contralateral hemisphere) for the control group and 0.3+/-0.2% for the RTN-treated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No increased mortality was seen in the RTN-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RTN treatment during MCAO effectively reverses the pathophysiological sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, even when the treatment is initiated 1 hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the control group was variable when quantitatively assessed 6 days after 3.5 hours of MCAO, virtually no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was seen in the RTN-treated group </plain></SENT>
