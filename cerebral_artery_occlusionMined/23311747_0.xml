<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: Tetramethylpyrazine (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>) is used to treat cerebrovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it displays a short half-life that restricts clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24712">Hydroxymethyl</z:chebi>-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (HTMP) is the principal active metabolite of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>, with similar activity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it makes sense to improve the biopharmaceutical characteristics via HTMP bypassing <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purpose: To prolong the half-life of HTMP and achieve improved bioavailability and efficacy compared to commercially available product of tetramethylpyrazine phosphate injection (TMPP-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: A lipophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> of HTMP, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> of HTMP (HTMPP) was synthesized, and then the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> emulsion of HTMPP was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was applied to evaluate the efficacy in different administration group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results and Discussion: The optimized formulation consisted of 1.5% (w/v) HTMPP, 15% (w/v) soybean oil, 1.2% (w/v) soybean lecithin and 0.3% (w/v) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">poloxamer</z:chebi> 188 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AUC(0-180 min) and the half-life of HTMP in HTMPP-LE was 2.05-fold and 1.48-fold greater than that in TMPP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The brain AUC(0-120 min) of HTMP in HTMPP-LE group increased by 145.6% compared to that in TMPP-I group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences could be primarily attributed to dissimilar metabolism between HTMPP and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consistently, HTMPP-LE exhibited better efficacy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion model than TMPP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The developed HTMPP-LE suggests a great therapeutic potential for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
