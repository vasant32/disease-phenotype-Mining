<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied whether administration of exogenous TGF-alpha into the brain can protect neurons against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a model of permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat, and whether any effect of TGF-alpha was mediated by EGFR by administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53110">4,5-dianilinophthalimide</z:chebi> (DAPH), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> with high selectivity for EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received either TGF-alpha (10 or 25 ng), DAPH (100 ng), DAPH plus TGF-alpha (25 ng), or vehicle in the ipsilateral first ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drugs were administered twice: 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evaluated 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-alpha at the dose of 25 ng caused a statistically significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (60%) in relation to ischemic rats administered vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reduction was no longer seen when TGF-alpha was administered in combination with DAPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results show that TGF-alpha can protect neurons from ischemic damage, and that this effect is mediated by EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that activation of EGFR-mediated intracellular signalling pathways contributes to the survival of neural cells susceptible to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
