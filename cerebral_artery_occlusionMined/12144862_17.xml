<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Ad-GDNF significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when immediately administered after the reperfusion, but became insignificant when administered at 1 h after the reperfusion as were the cases treated with vehicle- and adenoviral vector containing the E. coli lacZ gene (Ad-LacZ)-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of GDNF was related to the significant reduction of the number of TUNEL positive cells as well as immunohistochemical positive cells for active caspase-3 but not -9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results showed that exogenous GDNF gene transfer successfully reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a time-dependant manner by suppressing active caspase-3 but not active caspase-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic time window was shorter than the effect of GDNF protein itself previously reported </plain></SENT>
