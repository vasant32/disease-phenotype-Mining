<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated change of immunoreactivity for PML protein in rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and compared the results with that of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blotting analysis revealed that PML immunoreactivity was only scant in the sham-control brain, but it increased at 1 h and 1 day after reperfusion, and decreased in density thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that nuclei of neurons were most densely stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL positive cells appeared at 1 day and peaked at 3 days of reperfusion, indicating that PML protein induction preceded DNA fragmentation in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that PML protein may be one of the key molecules in ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
