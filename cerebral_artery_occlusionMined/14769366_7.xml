<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we have compared the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and measured the levels of their products <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)) and cysteine-containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> (cys-LTs) after different reperfusion periods in diabetic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion was accompanied by increased expression of COX-2 and release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), peaking at 12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of COX-2 was maintained at a high level until 24 h after reperfusion, while the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) were declined rapidly to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of 5-LOX and levels of cys-LTs reached a peak at 6 and 12 h after reperfusion, respectively, and was returned to baseline at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, the expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX as well as release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) and cys-LTs was elevated in the brains of diabetic rats, revealing a possible mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-mediated aggravation of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites mediated by inhibitors of its metabolites could be helpful in preventing ischemic brain injury in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
