<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such maturation implies the existence of endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> is an endogenous neuroprotectant regulated by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> kinase (ADK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate, whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> might play a role in protecting the hippocampus after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we subjected transgenic mice, which overexpress ADK in hippocampal neurons (Adk-tg mice) to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the hippocampus of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) mice was consistently spared from injury after 60 mins of MCAO, hippocampal injury became evident in Adk-tg mice after only 15 mins of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine, whether downregulation of hippocampal ADK might qualify as candidate mechanism mediating endogenous neuroprotection, we evaluated ADK expression in wt mice after several periods of reperfusion after 15 or 60 mins of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 60 mins of MCAO, hippocampal ADK was significantly reduced in both hemispheres after 1, 3, and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction of ADK-immunoreactivity corresponded to a 2.2-fold increase in hippocampal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> at 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, a significant reduction of ADK immunoreactivity was also found in the ipsilateral (stroked) hippocampus after 15 mins of MCAO and 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, transient downregulation of hippocampal ADK after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might be a protective mechanism during maturation hippocampal cell loss </plain></SENT>
