<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The present study had two main objectives: to validate a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in terms of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and to compare, using the validated model, the potential activity on the somatosensory function of the new, approved contrast agent gadobenate dimeglumine with that of gadobutrol, a specific contrast agent, for magnetic resonance imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were prepared for SEP recording at least 5 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by 30-minute right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 3-day reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SEP responses, evoked contralaterally to the stimulated upper limb, were recorded from the primary somatosensory cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model validation, on day 3 after occlusion, was performed using iopromide, an iodinated contrast agent poorly neurotolerated in rats, intravenously injected at 7 g I/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparative study between gadobenate dimeglumine and gadobutrol was performed at an intravenously injected dose of 2 mmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potential responses were measured as peak latencies (P2 and N2) and peak-to-peak amplitude (P2N2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain concentration of iopromide was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, whereas that of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast agent was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry analysis; given the absence of metabolism for both contrast agents, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> content values can be interpreted as representing unmetabolized contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ischemic rats, the SEP responses of the lesioned hemisphere showed significant increases in P2, N2, and interpeak N2-P2 latencies and a significant reduction in peak-to-peak (P2N2) amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the validation experiments, iopromide dramatically increased the P2N2 amplitude of the SEP responses recorded from both hemispheres of ischemic rats without affecting the P2, N2, and interpeak N2-P2 latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The iopromide effect was coupled with high concentrations of the contrast agent in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Iopromide had no effect on healthy rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the comparative study, gadobenate dimeglumine did not induce any alteration in SEP components of either the lesioned or unlesioned hemisphere of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In fact, no significant difference was found between responses obtained before and after gadobenate dimeglumine injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gadobutrol, administered at the same dose, on the whole showed the same behavior as gadobenate dimeglumine, although a slight but significant decrease in the P2 latency, a sign of excitatory activity, was observed 2 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Analytic data indicated higher levels of contrast agent in the lesioned hemisphere versus the unlesioned hemisphere 2 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, three conclusions can be drawn: (1) the evaluation of SEPs in ischemic rats is a useful tool for assessing the potential neurological effects of a new contrast agent because ischemic and contrast agent effects can be clearly differentiated; (2) the experimental conditions used allow the contrast agents to penetrate into the brain, where their activity can be manifested and evaluated; and (3) the complete absence of neurological activity of gadobenate dimeglumine shows its safety profile and confirms its suitability for use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> for which contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is indicated </plain></SENT>
