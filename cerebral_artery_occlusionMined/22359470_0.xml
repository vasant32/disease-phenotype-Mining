<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the neuroprotective action of this herbal medicine, we examined the influence of BG on the learning and memory of rats using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, and we studied the effects of BG on the central cholinergic system and neural nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthesis in the hippocampus of rats with neuronal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was applied for 2h, the rats were administered BG (100 or 400 mgkg(-1), p.o.) daily for 2 weeks, followed by training and performance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats with ischemic insults showed impaired learning and memory on the tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with BG produced improvement in the escape latency to find the platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the BG groups showed a reduced loss of cholinergic immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi>-diaphorase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-d)-positive neurons in the hippocampus compared to that of the ISC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that BG has a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that BG might be useful for the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
