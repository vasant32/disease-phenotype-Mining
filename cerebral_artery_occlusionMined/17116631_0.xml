<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors used computed tomography (CT) to assess and categorize the topography of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (IS) among blacks living in Abidjan, the commercial and administrative center of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, in West Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed CT data of patients admitted to the Sainte Anne Marie Polyclinic (the principal private hospital in the country) and to the neurology department of the university hospital center in Cocody, from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included patients who met World Health Organisation criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and had CT performed during the hospitalization for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined CT data to find early and late signs of IS, analyze lesion diameter (15 mm cutoff used to distinguish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from lacuna), and determine their topography (cerebral arterial territory and localization, that is, brain lobes, basal ganglia and posterior cerebral fossa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 260 subjects (58% males) with a median age of 45 years (range: 20-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT findings were abnormal for 224 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (72.7%), lacuna (27.3%), or both (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As reported elsewhere, the anterior arterial territory was most often affected (83.9%) with a middle cerebral artery lesion in 79.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Posterior territory (16.1%) lesions and lacuna were probably underestimated because CT exploration is reported to be less useful for this area than for the carotid area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CT diagnoses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> more easily than it does lacuna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for 36 patients although performed no more than 3 days after IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients did not undergo CT angiography, which might have shown cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study included IS of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types and typography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> registries in Africa would provide useful data for better assessment of prevalence for specific topographic and etiologic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
