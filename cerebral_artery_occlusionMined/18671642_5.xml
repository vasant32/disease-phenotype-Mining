<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain swelling</z:e> further impairs collateral blood flow to the ischemic penumbra and causes mechanical damage to adjacent brain structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the authors sought to quantify the impact of this space-occupying effect on ischemic lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats were assigned to undergo bilateral craniectomy or a sham operation and then were subjected to temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical evaluation and 7-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies were performed 5 and 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute brain water content was determined at 24 hours by using the wet/dry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral craniectomy before MCAO led to a drastic reduction in lesion volume at both imaging time points (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was 2.7- and 2.3-fold larger in sham-operated animals after 5 and 24 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical scores were likewise better in rats that had undergone craniectomy (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours the midline shift differed significantly between the 2 groups (p &lt; 0.001), but not after 5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relation between brain water content and ischemic lesion volume as well as the T2 relaxation time within the infarcted area was not different between the groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that collateral damage caused by the space-occupying effect of a large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> contributes seriously to ischemic lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The elimination of increased ICP thus must be regarded as a highly neuroprotective measure, rather than only a life-saving procedure to prevent cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further clinical trials should reveal the neuroprotective potential of surgical and pharmacological ICP-lowering therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
