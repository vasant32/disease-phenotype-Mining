<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), extracted from Carthamus tinctorius L. markedly extended the coagulation time in mice and exhibited a significant antithrombotic effect in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to demonstrate further its neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemic injury in both in vivo and in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo, male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were evaluated for neurological deficit scores followed by the treatment with a single dose of HSYA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the infarction area of the brain was assessed in the brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the effect of HSYA was tested in cultured fetal cortical cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33192">sodium cyanide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33192">NaCN</z:chebi>) to identify its neuroprotection against neurons damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results in vivo showed that sublingular vein injection of HSYA at doses of 3.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg exerted significant neuroprotective effects on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury by significantly decreasing neurological deficit scores and reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area compared with the saline group, HSYA at a dose of 6.0 mg/kg showed a similar potency as nimodipine at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sublingular vein injection of HSYA at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg showed a neuroprotective effect, however, with no significant difference when compared with the saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results in vitro showed that HSYA significantly inhibited neuron damage induced by exposure to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33192">sodium cyanide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33192">NaCN</z:chebi>) in cultured fetal cortical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Noticeably, the neuroprotective action of HSYA on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated neuron injury was much better than that of HSYA on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33192">NaCN</z:chebi>-induced neuron damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings suggest that HSYA might act as a potential neuroprotective agent useful in the treatment in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
