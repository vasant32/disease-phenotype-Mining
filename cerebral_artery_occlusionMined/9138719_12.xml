<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue we investigated the temporal changes in microvascular perfusion induced by permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of 5 min to 4 h duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two fluorescent tracers (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and Evans blue) were then sequentially administered i.v. and allowed to circulate for 10 and 5 s respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were examined by fluorescent microscopy, and the mean number of perfused microvessels/mm2 calculated for cortical areas representing non-ischemic (Region A), perifocal/penumbral (Region B) and core ischemic (Region C) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For sham-operated controls, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microvessels perfused with tracer within 5 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast MCAO induced significant reductions in the number of perfused microvessels in Regions B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most marked impairments in perfusion were observed in core <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (e.g. 2-10% of control values for 5 s circulation period) while, initially, the deficit was less severe in penumbral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a secondary perfusion impairment developed over time in the perifocal/penumbral region, so that the deficit was greater 4 h after MCAO than at earlier time points (e.g. 72%, 71% and 22% of control value for 0.5, 1 and 4 h MCAO respectively; 10 s circulation period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MCAO induced severe impairments in microcirculatory perfusion within the core ischemic region, and to a lesser extent in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the development of a more severe perfusion deficit in the penumbra within 4 h of MCAO supports the hypothesis that microcirculatory failure in this region contributes to its recruitment to the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
