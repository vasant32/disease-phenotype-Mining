<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether 8-O-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> shanzhiside methylester (ND01) regulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and thereby improves functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were subjected to 1 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion, and treated with or without different doses (5 and 10 mg/kg) of ND01, starting 24 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) and by intravenous injection daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional tests were performed and cerebral Evans blue extravasation was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> and angiogenic factor expression were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that ND01 significantly promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischaemic brain and improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ND01 also significantly increased vascularization compared with vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ND01 increased the expression of VEGF, Ang1, phosphorylation of Tie2 and Akt VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ang1/Tie2 axis and Akt pathways appear to mediate ND01-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
