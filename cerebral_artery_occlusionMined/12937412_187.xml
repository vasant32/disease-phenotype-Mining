<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the neuroprotective power of a cell-penetrating, protease-resistant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that blocks the access of JNK to many of its targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained strong protection in two models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO): transient occlusion in adult mice and permanent occlusion in 14-d-old rat pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first model, intraventricular administration as late as 6 h after occlusion reduced the lesion volume by more than 90% for at least 14 d and prevented behavioral consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second model, systemic delivery reduced the lesion by 78% and 49% at 6 and 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protection correlated with prevention of an increase in c-Jun activation and c-Fos transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In view of its potency and long therapeutic window, this protease-resistant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is a promising neuroprotective agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
