<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duration of viability of human penumbral tissue under such circumstances is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who had prolonged survival of penumbral tissue with subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extension after pressor agents were withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced collateral flow by elevation of blood pressure may result in prolonged survival of the ischemic penumbra which remains dependent on persistent use of pressor agents </plain></SENT>
