<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong induction of p-ERK was primarily expressed in the ischemic penumbra, while that of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> signal was strongly induced in the ischemic core from 3 min to 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The double-stained cells with strong p-ERK/weak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> became most apparent at 3 min primarily expressed in the ischemic penumbra, whereas the cells with weak p-ERK/strong <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> were predominantly found in the ischemic core at 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of double positive cells among the total number of single positive cells decreased in the ischemic core, and increased in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the coordinate expression of p-ERK and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> is fundamentally involved in cell survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at the early stage of reperfusion, and that they could play roles in different temporal and spatial profiles </plain></SENT>
