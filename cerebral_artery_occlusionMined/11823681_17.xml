<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our findings on early recanalization during transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) continuous monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) main stem occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed continuous TCCD monitorings in 6 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion using a 2-MHz transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were not treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial recanalization, defined as blunted waveforms, occurred during monitoring in 5 patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time to beginning of recanalization was 17.2+/-9.6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization at 24 hours occurred in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score in the patients who recanalized during monitoring was 21.2+/-4.1 at baseline, 19.2+/-5 at 2 hours, and 15.6+/-3.4 at 24 hours (P=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this short series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion, not treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, we found a high rate of early partial recanalization during continuous exposure to 2-MHz ultrasound </plain></SENT>
