<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between cell proliferation of the ependymal/subventricular zone (SVZ), a principal neuroproliferative region in the adult brain, and nNOS expression, the male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>10 microl of 0.2% fluorescence dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi> was injected into the right lateral ventricle to prelabel ependymal/subventricular zone cells before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and days 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 28 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-labeled cell counting was employed to assess cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and grayscale analysis were performed to determine nNOS localization and its quantity in the specific regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control, the density of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-labeled cells in the ipsilateral ependyma/SVZ was significantly higher at days 1, 3, 7 and 11 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas the quantity of nNOS expression in the ependyma/SVZ adjacent regions was significantly lower at the above time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, nNOS positive cells were largely excluded from SVZ, and their long processes did not enter the ependyma/SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, decreased nNOS expression in the ipsilateral ependymal/SVZ adjacent regions might be related to cell proliferation in the ependymal/SVZ </plain></SENT>
