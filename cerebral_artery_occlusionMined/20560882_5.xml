<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, cell therapy appears to partly reverse some behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of action remain uncertain as most studies reveal only little, if any, evidence for neuronal replacement and observed behavioral improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This present study was performed to test rodent fetus forebrain derived neural stem cells (NSCs) implantation into rats subjected to suture-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of cell therapy was studied regarding behavior recovery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and protection possibility of related molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that grafted cells can home in on damaged regions by MCAO and significantly improve behavior of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were diminished after grafted NSCs treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we detected <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> related molecules such as COX-2 and IL-1beta and found that grafted NSCs treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> could repress expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> molecular protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also detected protein levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) as a protective protein against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that grafted NSCs treatment induced the protein level of HSP27 and down-regulated activity of caspase-3 compared with the vehicle control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that transplanted NSCs provide benefits in behavioral function recovery after MCAO and increase neuroprotection whilst repressing inflammatory destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data reveal another essential explanation of cellular transplantation therapy in damage recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and offer new therapeutic possibilities </plain></SENT>
