<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuroprotective effects of pre- and postconditioning on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two male rats were divided into occlusion, preconditioning, postconditioning and both pre- and postconditioning groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAo (120 minutes) was monitored with continuous cerebral tissue oxygen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27140">(O2)</z:chebi> pressure (PtiO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-conditioning comprised 10 minutes of MCAo, 24 hours prior to the 120 minute MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postconditioning algorithm was 30 seconds of reperfusion followed by 30 seconds of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This cycle was repeated 3 times at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes showed a significant difference between the conditioned groups and occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there was better protection in the preconditioning group compared with the other two conditioned groups, the results did not reach statistically significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that preconditioning, postconditioning and pre/post conditioning have protective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
