<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neuroplasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, exogenous treatment with BDNF or exposing animals to enrichment and exercise regimens, which also increase BDNF, enhances behavioral recovery after brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in promoting recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may also depend on BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the contribution of BDNF to motor skill relearning after endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antisense BDNF oligonucleotide, which blocks the expression of BDNF (or saline vehicle) was infused into the contralateral lateral ventricle for 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals received either a graduated rehabilitation program, including running exercise and skilled reaching training, which simulates clinical practice, or no rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was assessed with a battery of tests that measured skilled reaching, forelimb use asymmetry, and foraging ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rehabilitation significantly improved skilled reaching ability in the staircase task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antisense BDNF oligonucleotide effectively blocked BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and negated the beneficial effects of rehabilitation on recovery of skilled reaching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, antisense BDNF oligonucleotide did not affect reaching with the unaffected limb, body weight, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, or foraging ability, indicating the treatment was specific to relearning of motor skill after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify a critical role for BDNF in rehabilitation-induced recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and our results suggest that new treatments to enhance BDNF would constitute a promising therapy for promoting recovery of function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
