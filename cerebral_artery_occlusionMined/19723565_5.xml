<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cultures subjected to OGD, HUCBC but not DTG treatment reduced the number of degenerating neurons and the production of microglial derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> back to levels detected in normoxic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that HUCBC treatment can mediate direct neuroprotection and suppress innate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in ischemic brain tissue in the absence of the peripheral immune system, whereas DTG requires peripheral effects to mediate neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
