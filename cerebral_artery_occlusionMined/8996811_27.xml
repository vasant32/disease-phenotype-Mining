<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A transient episode of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced a strong microglial response in the areas undergoing neural cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from 4 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by increased expression of Stat3 in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum, as revealed by Western blotting of tissue extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed strong induction of Stat3 in reactive microglial cells 4, 7 and 15 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stat3 was seen in the microglia cytoplasm, but in many microglial cells immunoreactivity was also distributed within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Stat3 mediates signal transduction and activates transcription in reactive microglia in vivo following brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
