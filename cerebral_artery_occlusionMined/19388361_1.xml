<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have pursued the concept that traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> is predominantly cellular and that water entry is modulated in part by aquaporins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been shown to play a significant role in cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">Phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) is a potent PKC activator; purportedly involved in modulation of AQP4 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, AQP4 may be regulated by arginine-vasopressin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of the vasopressin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (SR49059) reduced brain water content and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> shift following MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation is affected by the reduction of AQP4 expression, we utilized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and SR49059 following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAo), and measured AQP4 expression by Western-Blot (WB) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham (n=4) or MCAo groups (vehicle, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> or SR49059 infusion; n=6 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each solution was infused for 5 hours, starting 1 hour before injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a two-hour period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and two-hour reperfusion, animals were sacrificed and brain regions of interest were processed by WB to quantify the effect of treatment on AQP4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These studies demonstrate that MCAo results in a significant up-regulation of AQP4 on the ischemic zone when compared to the contralateral un-injured hemisphere (p &lt; 0.05) and that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and SR49059 treatment significantly down-regulated AQP4 expression compared to the vehicle group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies support the hypotheses that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and SR49059 may be useful in reducing cerebral water accumulation by modulating AQP4 expression and that pharmacological manipulation of AQP4 may emerge as a viable strategy for the reduction of fulminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
