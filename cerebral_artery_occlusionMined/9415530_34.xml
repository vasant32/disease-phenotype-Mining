<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To systematically elucidate the gene expression of inflammatory and immune modulators following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat, we studied interleukin-10 (IL-10) along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of these cytokines was studied ipsilateral and contralateral to the MCAO, with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels evaluated 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h following permanent MCAO by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic hemisphere TNF-alpha and IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased at 2 h following MCAO and peaked at 6 h, with IL-10 mRNA detected only at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contralaterally, both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were expressed with a similar pattern to that in the ischemic hemisphere, but at lower levels, with no contralateral IL-10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in IL-2 gene expression between control and experimental animals in either hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that IL-10 and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta gene expression is induced early following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of these cytokines is similar to that seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, where TNF-alpha induces IL-10; subsequently IL-10 inhibits TNF-alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the temporal profile of cytokine expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> suggests that IL-10 should be studied as a potential inhibitor of TNF-alpha production in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors inducing contralateral expression of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, along with the potential clinical significance of this remote cytokine gene expression, merit further study </plain></SENT>
