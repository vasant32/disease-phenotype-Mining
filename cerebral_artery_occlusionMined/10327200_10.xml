<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is mainly expressed in neurons, and supposed to be involved in the dynamic change of neurocytoskeleton structure seen in the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated immunoreactivity for cdk5 and its critical regulatory subunit p35 in rat brain after 90 min of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control brain, immunoreactive cdk5 was present in some neurons, while p35 was evident in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after blood flow restoration, both of them were remarkably increased in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 h, both immunoreactivities were decreased in the ischemic core region, while they became stronger in neurons at the boundary zone of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, which decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results might suggest that increased cdk5 activity in the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused depolymerization of neurocytoskeletons, which resulted in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
