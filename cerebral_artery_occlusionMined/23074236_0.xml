<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effect of acupuncture treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to assess its effects in rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) and discuss its mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 21 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 underwent tMCAO and subsequently received acupuncture treatment, Group 2 underwent tMCAO without treatment and Group 3 only underwent sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evolution of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) features in ischaemic lesions from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> periods was assessed and the correlations with behavioural tests and histopathological changes were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: tMCAO rats displayed side-specific sensorimotor deficits after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioural scores of rats in group 1 reduced gradually with acupuncture treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in lesion size on T2-weighted imaging was found between the two tMCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) and relative fractional anisotropy (rFA) values in the centre and at the edge of the ischaemic lesions reduced at first and then increased to varying degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only changes in the rFA value at the edge of the ischaemic lesions were significantly different between the two tMCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A more significant increase in growth-associated protein B-50 and synaptophysin protein expression was found in group 1 than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were found between behavioural scores, DTI appearances and immunohistochemical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The acupuncture points applied were effective, and improving neuronal regeneration may have a role in the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the limbs in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MRI, particularly the fractional anisotropy value of DTI, is an appropriate parameter to evaluate the recovery status </plain></SENT>
