<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their combination as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment has the potential benefits of decreasing individual drug dosage and fewer adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated their synergistic effects and compared a low-dose combination with individual drug alone and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 90 min of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments: placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (MgSO₄; 45 mg/kg) intravenously immediately after the induction of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> (6 mg/kg) intraperitoneally before reperfusion, and combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion insult, therapeutic outcome was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and a 28-point neurological severity scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E₂, myeloperoxidase, and caspase-3 expression after treatment were evaluated using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemical staining, followed by immunoreactive cell analysis using tissue cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the combination treatment group showed a significant decrease in infarction volume (10.93±6.54% versus 26.43±7.08%, p&lt;0.01), and neurological severity score (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-dose MgSO₄ or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> showed no significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also significant suppression of cyclooxygenase-2, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E₂, myeloperoxidase, and caspase-3 expression in the combination treatment group, suggesting that the combination of the two drugs improved the neuroprotective effects of each individual drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MgSO₄ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> have synergistic effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion insults </plain></SENT>
