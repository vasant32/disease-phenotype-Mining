<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> has a remarkable protective effect against different types of brain injury including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since there are no reports on the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> on permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and because most cases of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are caused by permanent occlusion of cerebral arteries, the present study was conducted to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological deficits induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats, via surgical insertion of a nylon filament into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes (cortical, subcortical and total) and functional recovery, assessed by neurological score evaluation and rotarod performance test, were performed 24 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In initial experiments, different doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> (3, 6 and 12 mg/kg; i.p) or vehicle were administered 30 min before pMCAO and again at 6, 12 and 18 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In later experiments we investigated the therapeutic time window of protection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> by delaying its first administration 0.5-4 h after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated treatments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> dose-dependently reduced cortical, subcortical and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as well as the neurological deficits and motor impairment resulting from permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but only the administration of the highest dose (12 mg/kg) was able to significantly (P &lt; 0.01) diminish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lower doses failed to significantly reduce infarction but showed a beneficial effect on neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">Nimesulide</z:chebi> (12 mg/kg) not only reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but also enhanced functional recovery when the first treatment was given up to 2 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> protects against permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, even with a 2 h post-treatment delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings have important implications for the therapeutic potential of using COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
