<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a treatment combining nimodipine and citicoline might have a potential neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess this idea, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient bilateral common carotid artery ligation with simultaneous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four treatment groups were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received either: a) saline (control group); b) intracarotid nimodipine infusion during 30 min in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (nimodipine group); c) i.p. postischemic citicoline injections once daily for 7 days (citicoline group); or d) intracarotid nimodipine bolus during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion plus i.p. postichemic citicoline injections (combination group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were killed after either 7 or 3 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first case, the volume of the infarcted tissue was studied by a stereological procedure and in the second case, in situ end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and Bcl-2 expression were employed to determine the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in both the nimodipine and the citicoline treatment groups after 7 days of reperfusion; combination of both drugs produced an additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of reperfusion, the number of Bcl-2-positive neurons was significantly increased while that of TUNEL-positive cells significantly decreased at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border in the combined-treatment animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate a neuroprotective effect from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> single dose of nimodipine during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion and prolonged post-ischemic treatment with citicoline in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a possible mechanism of neuroprotective action would be mediated by increased Bcl-2 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> within the boundary zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> together with neutralization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
