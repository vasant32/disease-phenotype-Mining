<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect may be site-dependent, because we have also found that early forced use of the affected limb after unilateral 6-OHDA induced degeneration of ascending nigrostriatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons markedly enhanced functional outcome and is neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the effects of early overuse and disuse following a moderately severe proximal MCAo model, by means of intraluminal suture occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced in male Long-Evans rats with 60 min of occlusion, or sham surgery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early overuse or disuse of the affected forelimb was forced by immobilizing either the ipsilateral or contralateral forelimb, respectively, in a plaster cast or the animal was left uncasted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Casts were removed on day 10 and sensorimotor testing was performed weekly during days 17-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed on day 45 and brains were fixed for later <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MCAo+contralateral cast group performed worse than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups on tests of forelimb sensorimotor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MCAo groups regardless of cast condition had significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the ischemic striatum, but there was no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the ischemic cortex in any group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of disuse and overuse during the first 10 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differ depending on cortical or subcortical involvement </plain></SENT>
