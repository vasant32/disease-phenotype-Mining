<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of the free radical spin trap N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by an intraluminal filament, the artery was reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg PBN 5 min before and 30 min after insertion of the filament significantly attenuated the lesion volume measured 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and during the first 30 min after reperfusion, cerebral blood volume and blood flow were measured by volume-sensitive and newly developed flow-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals the area of decreased blood flow was larger than the area of decreased volume by a factor of 2.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area of the postreperfusion flow deficits matched the final lesion volumes at 24 h measured histologically much better than did the blood volume deficits in both saline and PBN-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion led to a return of blood flow and volume to values close to the contralateral side in the PBN-treated animals, in contrast to the saline-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion PBN provides protection of the vascular endothelium, leading to enhanced postischemic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implication of this is that the vascular endothelium may be a primary target for the damaging action of free radicals given the protection afforded by putative spin traps </plain></SENT>
