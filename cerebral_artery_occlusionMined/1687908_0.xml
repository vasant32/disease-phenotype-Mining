<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ver or Nim iv induced significant reduction of MAP and CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was increased in dogs and unaltered in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hex treated dogs and cats exhibited a fall of MAP and CBF with enhancement of CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was reduced from 190 +/- 70 to 90 +/- 20 ml.kg-1.min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ver and Nim iv caused similar changes of MAP and CVR to those before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that Ver and Nim may have vasodilation effect and improve the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
