<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that exercise improves functional outcome in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since netrin-1 and its receptors, deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and uncoordinated gene 5B (Unc5B), act as important regulators in neural and vascular activities, we sought to determine whether netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and Unc5B are involved in the neuroprotective effects of exercise on rats with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 108 rats were randomly distributed into three groups: sham-operated group (n = 12), middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group (n = 48), MCAO+treadmill exercise group (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing indicated that treadmill exercise could significantly improve neurologic deficits of rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at day 14 and 28 after MCAO (n = 12, P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01), but there was no significant difference at day 4 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analysis revealed that treadmill exercise enhanced netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression, while it suppressed Unc5B expression in rat peri-ischemic brain area, especially at day 14 and 28 after MCAO (n = 4, P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in the peri-ischemic area, netrin-1 was expressed in neuronal perikarya, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, however, was expressed in neural processes and peri-vascular astrocytes, while Unc5B was expressed mostly in neuronal perikarya and some processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that netrin-1 and its receptors <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and Unc5B may engage in exercise-induced neural circuit remodeling in the peri-ischemic area, and exercise may promote survival of neurons in this area by regulating netrin-1-Unc5B signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, netrin-1 may also play a role in brain-blood barrier via <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>-immunoreactive peri-vascular astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrate that treadmill exercise has beneficial effects that may be attributed, at least in part, to the involvement of netrin-1 and its receptors <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and Unc5B in the neuronal and vascular activities in brain-ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
