<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had internal carotid and two had proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for the first two cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was introduced early and the temperature reached 35.0 degrees C within 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The core temperature finally stabilized between 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> was observed during the rewarming process, but two patients became independent and three patients were moderately disabled in wheelchairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only two patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> through the relief of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall outcome may be improved by combining brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with other conventional therapies such as osmotherapy and external decompression implemented with an extended period of rewarming </plain></SENT>
