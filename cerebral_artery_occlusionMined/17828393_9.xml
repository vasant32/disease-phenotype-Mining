<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that the expression of inflammatory genes (Il6, iNOS, cxcl2, TNF-alpha and Il-1beta) and extracellular-matrix-related genes (MMP9, MMP13) is induced in cerebral arteries following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> via activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated kinases (MAPKs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested in vivo by experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and temporal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and by organ culture of isolated cerebral arteries with quantitative real time PCR (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression) and immunohistochemistry (localization of protein expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene promoters were investigated in <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> with computer analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analysis revealed that the ischemic models, SAH and MCAO, as well as organ culture of isolated cerebral arteries resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the abovementioned genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein expression involved phosphorylation of three different MAPKs signalling pathways (p38, ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK) and the downstream transcription factors (ATF-2, Elk-1, c-Jun) shown by immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three models revealed the same pattern of activation in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> analysis demonstrated binding sites for said transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and organ culture induce activation of p38, ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK in cerebral arteries which in turn activate the transcription factors ATF-2, Elk-1 and c-Jun and the expression of inflammatory and extracellular-matrix-related genes in the wall of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
