<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested a modified nylon suture in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under two anesthesia regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups (Group 1, Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia; Group 2, modified suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia; Group 3, Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia with mechanical ventilation; Group 4, modified suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia with mechanical ventilation; Group 5, Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated suture under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia; Group 6, modified suture under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia) and subjected to 2-hour MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored by Laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation and ischemic lesion (TTC stain) were assessed at 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total ischemic lesion (sum of areas with lacking and intermediate TTC staining) was similar among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with a Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated suture technique, the modified suture technique produced a lower rCBF, larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, smaller variance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and greater neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of this modified suture technique with ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and mechanical ventilation produces a more consistent change in cerebral ischemic damage following MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
