<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-Estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects when administered before an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether E2 treatment after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exerts the same effects and, if so, how long this therapeutic window remains open, and whether the effects are related to changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In protocol 1, E2 was administered (100 microg/kg IV followed immediately by subcutaneous implantation of crystalline E2 in a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomer tube) to ovariectomized females (OVX+E2) at 0.5 (n=8), 1 (n=6), 2 (n=7), 3 (n=6), or 4 (n=9) hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intact (INT; n=6) and ovariectomized females (OVX; n=12) were subjected to MCAO and received vehicle instead of E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two days after MCAO the animals were killed, and ischemic lesion volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In protocol 2, CBF was monitored before and at 1, 24, and 48 hours in a group of animals receiving E2 or vehicle 0.5 hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction (INT, n=6; OVX, n=8; OVX+E2, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion volume was 20.9+/-2.2% and 21.8+/-1.2% in the INT and OVX groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E2 was found to decrease lesion volume significantly when administered within 3 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion volumes were 6.3+/-0.5%, 10.3+/-2.1%, 11.8+/-1.8%, 13.5+/-1.6%, and 17.9+/-2.8% when E2 was administered at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF decreased to 43.1+/-2.2% and 25.4+/-1.0% in the INT and OVX animals, respectively, at 5 minutes after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In comparison to OVX rats, CBF was not different at 1 hour after E2 administration but was increased significantly in the OVX+E2 group 1 and 2 days after E2 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: E2 exerts neuroprotective effects when administered after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with a therapeutic window in a permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model of approximately 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> was associated with no immediate change in blood flow but with a delayed increase in CBF </plain></SENT>
