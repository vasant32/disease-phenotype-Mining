<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in caspase-3, Abeta and BACE1 levels were detected in rat striatum on different days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the positive labeled cells of activated caspase-3, Abeta, and BACE1 were significantly and time-dependently increased in the ipsilateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK reduced BACE1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, and inhibited its protease activity, thereby decreasing the amount of APP C99 and Abeta in ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Z-DEVD-FMK reduced BACE1 and GFAP double-labeled cells, but not GFAP protein levels or GFAP-labeled cells, in the ipsilateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrated that caspase-3 inhibition attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced Abeta formation by reducing BACE1 production and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding provides a therapeutic strategy for preventing Abeta accumulation and reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
