<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To begin to probe the underlying mechanisms, which are unknown, we characterized two mouse strains with marked differences in both parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after femoral artery ligation, collateral and foot perfusion were lower in BALB/c than C57BL/6 (P &lt; 0.05 here and below), suggesting fewer pre-existing collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed with angiography and immunohistochemistry (approximately 35% fewer collaterals in the BALB/c's thigh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery of hindlimb perfusion was attenuated in BALB/c, in association with 54% less collateral remodeling, <z:mp ids='MP_0005602'>reduced angiogenesis</z:mp>, greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and more impaired hindlimb use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Densities of CD45+ and CD4+ leukocytes around collaterals increased similarly, but TNF-alpha expression was 50% lower in BALB/c, which may contribute to reduced collateral remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, compared with C57BL/6, BALB/c exhibit an altered arterial branching pattern and, like skeletal muscle above, have 30% fewer collaterals in intestine and, remarkably, almost none in pial circulation, resulting in greatly impaired perfusion after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic induction of VEGF-A was attenuated in BALB/c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a C57BL/6 x BALB/c recombinant inbred strain dataset identified a quantitative trait locus for VEGF-A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance at or near the Vegfa locus that associates with lower expression in BALB/c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests a cis-acting polymorphism in the Vegfa gene in BALB/c could contribute to reduced VEGF-A expression and, in turn, the above deficiencies in this strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest these strains offer a model to investigate genetic determinants of collateral formation and growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
