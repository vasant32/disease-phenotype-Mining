<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the temporal profile of nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity (NGF-LI) in the rat brains following 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were decapitated at 4 h, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain sections at the level of striatum were immunostained against NGF as well as a stress protein, HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, double immunostaining of NGF and glial fibrillary acidic protein was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the sham-control rats, NGF-LI was normally present in the cortical and striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at 4 h of recirculation, there was a significant decrease of NGF-LI in the ischemic cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 1 day, NGF-LI was absent completely in the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the ischemic cortex, NGF-LI decreased to the lowest level at 1 day, but it recovered gradually from 3 days and increased significantly to above sham-control level at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 14 days of recirculation, NGF-LI returned to a near sham-control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the non-ischemic cortex, NGF-LI increased gradually from 4 h with a peak at 7 days, and returned to the sham-control level at 14 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A HSP70 was induced in the ischemic cortex at 1 and 3 days, when there was a significant reduction of NGF-LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of reactive astrocytes increased gradually and NGF-LI in the reactive astrocytes became gradually intense after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present finding showing that NGF-LI can be recovered in the stressed cortical neurons suggests a possible involvement of NGF in the process of neuronal survival after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of NGF in reactive astrocytes indicates that astrocyte may also play a role in supporting neuronal survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
