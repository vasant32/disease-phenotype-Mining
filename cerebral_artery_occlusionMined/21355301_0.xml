<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the antagonistic action of Puerarin against the excitatory amino acid toxicity, and to further explore its brain protection mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was set up with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal block in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, Puerarin was administered at different time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was assessed by TTC stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NR1 positive neurons in hippocampus CA1 region was determined by immunohistochemistry SABC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> volumes were smaller in 2 h and 12 h model treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05) than those in model control groups, but no significant differences were observed in 24 h model treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with sham-operation group, the NR1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 region were increased obviously (P &lt; 0.05) in both model control and model treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with model control groups, the NR1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 were decreased obviously (P &lt; 0.05) in 2 h and 12 h treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The treatment of Puerarin within 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can cut down the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the puerarin treatment in earlier period after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can indirectly rivalry toxic effect of excitatory amino acids, relieve neural injury </plain></SENT>
