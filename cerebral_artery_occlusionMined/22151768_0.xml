<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral evaluation is frequently performed during <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> to confirm success of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS: We compared the value of behavioral testing and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging performed during <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> for identifying successfully operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were tested with behavioral assessment (using three scoring scales and the adhesive removal test) and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (including magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted imaging), both performed during the two-hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using the intraluminal suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral assessment was repeated 24 h after reperfusion, followed by sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> apparent diffusion coefficient lesion volume was correlated with both 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (r = 0·75, P = 0·02) and behavioral status (r = 0·66, P = 0·05) on day one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no correlation was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> behavioral examination and day one outcomes (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, r = 0·40, P = 0·28; behavioral examination, r = 0·39, P = 0·30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Day zero apparent diffusion coefficient volumes (P = 0·04), but not behavioral assessment (P = 0·60), discriminated animals with day one corticostriatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from these with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> behavioral testing performed during <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> fails to identify successfully operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> diffusion magnetic resonance imaging may be more appropriate to assess and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size variability in this model </plain></SENT>
