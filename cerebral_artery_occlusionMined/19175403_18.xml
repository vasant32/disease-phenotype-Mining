<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we transplanted human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural precursor cells (hNPCs) or vehicle into the cortex of rats after permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO) or sham-operation, and followed functional recovery in the cylinder and staircase tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hNPCs were examined prior to transplantation, and they expressed neuroectodermal markers but not markers for undifferentiated hESCs or non-neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were housed in either enriched environment or standard cages to examine the effects of additive rehabilitative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the behavioral tests dMCAO groups showed significant impairments compared with sham group before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vehicle groups remained significantly impaired in the cylinder test 1 and 2 months after vehicle injection, whereas hNPC transplanted groups did not differ from the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rehabilitation or hNPC transplantation had no effect on reaching ability measured in the staircase test, and no differences were found in the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 months we measured cell survival and differentiation in vivo using stereology and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Housing had no effect on cell survival or differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the transplanted hNPCs were positive for the neural precursor marker nestin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A portion of transplanted cells expressed neuronal markers 2 months after transplantation, whereas only a few cells co-localized with astroglial or oligodendrocyte markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hESC-derived neural precursor transplants provided some improvement in sensorimotor function after dMCAO, but did not restore more complicated sensorimotor functions </plain></SENT>
