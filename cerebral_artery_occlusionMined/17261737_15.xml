<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to cope with stressful conditions was shown to be dependent on proper T-cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the therapeutic window for neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insults such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is relatively narrow, we searched for a procedure that would allow the relevant T cells to be recruited rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To facilitate a rapid poststroke T cell activity, rats were treated with poly-YE using different regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control and poly-YE-treated rats were assessed for functional recovery using neurological severity score and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection, neurogenesis, growth factor expression, and microglial phenotype were assessed using histological and immunofluorescence methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of poly-YE as late as 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> yielded a beneficial effect manifested by better neurological performance, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, attenuation of behavioral deficits, and increased hippocampal and cortical neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This compound affected the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase by modulating microglial response and by increasing local production of insulin-like growth factor-I, known to be a key player in neuronal survival and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative wide therapeutic window, coupled with its efficacy in attenuating further degeneration and enhancing restoration, makes poly-YE a promising immune-based candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
