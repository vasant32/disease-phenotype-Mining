<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is increasingly clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in controlling cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the functional significance of miRNAs in ischemic brain injury remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assayed the expression levels of miR-29b after ischemic brain injury, and defined the target genes and biological functions of miR-29b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the miR-29b levels were significantly increased in rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and neurons after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-29b promoted neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whereas its repression decreased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we verified that miR-29b directly targeted and inhibited Bcl2L2 gene expression, and then increased neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Bcl2L2 overexpression rescued neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by miR-29b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an important role of miR-29b in regulating neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, thus offering a new target for the development of therapeutic agents against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
