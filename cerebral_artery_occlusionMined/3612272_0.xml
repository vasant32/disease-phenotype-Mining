<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) and systemic blood pressure were monitored continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An epidural balloon was inflated at regular intervals at three levels of arterial <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> tension (25, 35, and 50 mm Hg) before and after the administration of nimodipine, and volume-pressure curves were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In every case, curves generated after intravenous nimodipine infusion were lower and shifted more to the right than the same set of curves generated before nimodipine administration, regardless of the baseline ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction in ICP following nimodipine infusion was not due to a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and was statistically significant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three levels of pCO2 (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, in the presence of elevated ICP due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, there is no increased risk of exacerbating intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with the addition of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
