<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> models were induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats through bilateral cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) for different times (0, 30 and 60 min) or by stimulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> at different doses (5 or 15 g/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-BÃ¶tzinger Complex-Spikes and the expression of substance P, synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected with or without pretreatment of rats with BTX-A (15 or 30 U/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCAO reduced pre-Bot C spike activity (spike/s) and increased the breath rate (breaths/s) in an unstable pattern in comparison to controls, while pretreatment with BTX-A slightly reduced this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with BTX-A inhibited BCAO- or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-induced increases in expression of SNAP-25, substance P, and ROS in a dose-dependent manner in brainstem and lung tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BTX-A exerts a suppressive effect on neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> via non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic transmitters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results add to the body of evidence elucidating the non-cholinergic effects of BTX-A in the context of neurogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
