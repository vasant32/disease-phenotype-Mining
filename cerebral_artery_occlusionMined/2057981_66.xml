<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on the "state" of brain water using proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in five <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats via tandem occlusion of the left common carotid artery and the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proton transverse relaxation time, the proton density, and the water diffusion coefficient were measured at various times from the same region of brain tissue from 1.5 to 168 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early measurements indicated significant changes in the transverse relaxation time (p = 0.004) and water diffusion coefficient (p = 0.002) of ischemic brain tissue compared with a homologous region from the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the transverse relaxation time, proton density, and water diffusion coefficient in ischemic brain tissue showed different temporal evolutions over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion coefficient weighting was superior to relaxation time and proton density weighting for the visualization of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in detecting changes in proton-associated parameters during early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and confirm significant changes (p less than or equal to 0.01) in the temporal evolution of transverse relaxation times, proton densities, and diffusion coefficients following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
