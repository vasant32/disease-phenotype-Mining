<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the criteria for the indications, the choice of the thrombolytic agents, and the use of adjunctive agents are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic factors of IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1994 to 2003, 28 patients underwent IAT due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (17 women and 11 men; median age, 69 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the following prognostic parameters: institution of treatment, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> at visit, size of high-intensity area on diffusion-weighted images, dose of intraarterial urokinase administration, elapsed time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to completion of IAT, presence of penetration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> by microcatheter and microguidewire, recanalization after IAT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) within 24 hours after IAT, and intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration after IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was evaluated at discharge and was classified into the following categories according to the modified Rankin Scale: independence (0 to 2), dependence (3 to 5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients were judged to be independent, 16 patients were judged to be dependent, and five patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with recanalization after IAT had a better outcome than those without (p &lt; 0.05); patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> had a worse outcome than those without (p &lt; 0.05); and patients with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration after IAT had a better outcome in activities of daily living than those without (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and recanalization, our results suggested that intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration after IAT had a favorable effect on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
