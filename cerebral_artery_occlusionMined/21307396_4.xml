<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the effect of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on neuronal remodeling of the corticospinal tract originating from the contralesional cortex in mice subjected to unilateral pyramidotomy (PT) followed by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult mice with transgenic yellow fluorescent protein labeling in the corticospinal tract were subjected to right hemispheric PT and right permanent or sham MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One day later, the mice were treated intravenously with BMSCs or phosphate-buffered saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Foot-Fault test and a single pellet-reaching test were performed before surgery, 3 days after MCAO, and weekly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudorabies</z:e> virus-614-monomeric red fluorescent protein was injected into the left forelimb flexor muscles 28 days after surgery (4 days before euthanasia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain and cervical cord were processed for fluorescent microscopy to detect red fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein labeling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant functional improvements were evident in PT-MCAO mice treated with BMSCs (n=9) compared with phosphate-buffered saline-treated mice (n=9, P&lt;0.05), but not in mice with PT-sham MCAO treated with either phosphate-buffered saline (n=9) or BMSCs (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in PT-MCAO mice, both corticospinal tract axonal density in the denervated side of the cervical gray matter and red fluorescent protein-labeled pyramidal neurons in the left intact cortex were significantly increased compared with PT-sham MCAO mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMSCs significantly enhanced both corticospinal tract density and red fluorescent protein labeling in PT-MCAO mice (P&lt;0.05) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The behavioral outcome was highly correlated with corticospinal tract density and red fluorescent protein labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs amplify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced contralesional neuronal remodeling, which contributes to motor recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
