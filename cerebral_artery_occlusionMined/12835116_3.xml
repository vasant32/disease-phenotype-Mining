<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the expression of five <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (NaCh) Alpha-subunit genes after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in the rat and the effects of treatment with the NaCh blocker and experimental neuroprotective agent RS100642 as compared to the prototype NaCh blocker mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of Na(v) 1.1, Na(v) 1.2, Na(v) 1.3, Na(v) 1.7, Na(v) 1.8 and the housekeeping gene beta-actin were studied in vehicle or drug-treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-MCAo using real-time quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RS100642 (1 mg/kg), mexiletine (10 mg/kg), or vehicle (1 ml/kg) was injected (i.v.) at 30 min, 2, 4, and 6 h post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following MCAo only the Na(v) 1.1 and Na(v) 1.2 genes were significantly down-regulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the injured brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RS100642 treatment significantly reversed the down-regulation of Na(v) 1.1 (but not Na(v) 1.2) at 24-48 h post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine treatment, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the down-regulation of either gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that treatment with a neuroprotective dose of RS100642 significantly reverses the down-regulation of Na(v) 1.1 caused by ischemic brain injury and suggests that RS100642 selectively targets the Na(v) 1.1 Alpha-subunit of the NaCh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that ischemic injury may produce selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of voltage-gated NaChs, and suggest that the Na(v) 1.1 NaCh Alpha-subunit may play a key role in the neuronal injury/recovery process </plain></SENT>
