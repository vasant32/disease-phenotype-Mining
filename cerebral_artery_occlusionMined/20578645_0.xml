<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 30 male Wistar rats were divided randomly into control group, MCAo group and MCAo+DU26ES group, 10 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery occlusion</z:mp> models (MCAo) were created in accordance with Zea Longa method and modified method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DC continuous square-wave electric pulse stimuli (2Hz, 3mA) which was given between DU26 and non-acupoint area in the left shoulder, was applied to MCAo+DU26ES group 10 minutes every time, twice a day, while the control group and MCAo group received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 days later transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) was recorded, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> latency and peak-to-peak amplitude were analyzed and the neurological deficits were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) and MCAo injury on these parameters were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Given the isointensity suprathreshold stimulus, the latency on the affected side in MCAo group was significantly longer than that in control group (P&lt;0.05), the amplitudes on both sides were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.05); the latencies on both sides in MCAo+DU26ES group tended to become shorter and the amplitudes on both sides tended to increase compared with MCAo group; there were no significant differences on latency and amplitude between the healthy side and the affected side in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuro-scores of rats receiving electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) were significantly higher than those in MCAo group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) can improve the motor cortical excitability, and facilitate the motor function recovery after MCAo injury </plain></SENT>
