<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been an increasing interest in recent years in the evaluation of the neuronal and glial responses to ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), that are overexpressed after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rodents are thought to be implicated in the neuronal processes that lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, such cytokines could predict tissue fate after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans, although data are currently sparse for gyrencephalic species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study addressed the expression pattern of TGF-beta1 in a nonhuman primate model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced for 1 or 7 days in 6 baboons and the following investigations were undertaken: cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography studies, magnetic resonance imaging, postmortem histology, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to correlate the expression of TGF-beta1 to the underlying metabolic and histologic state of the threatened cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors evidenced increased TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (up to 25-fold) in those regions displaying a moderate (20% to 49%) reduction in CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that the greatly enhanced expression of TGF-beta1 in the penumbral zones that surround tissue destined to infarction may represent a robust index of potentially salvageable brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current investigation, in the nonhuman primate, strengthens the authors' hypothesis, derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e>, that TGF-beta1 may be involved in the physiopathology of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
