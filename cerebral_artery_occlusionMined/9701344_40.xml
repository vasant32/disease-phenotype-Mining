<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The site of action of IL-1beta in such damage is not known, but we have demonstrated previously that injection of the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) in the striatum but not the cortex of rats inhibits damage caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the site of action of IL-1beta on ischemic damage by examining the effects of intracerebroventricular, striatal, or cortical injection of recombinant IL-1beta at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1beta (2.5 ng) significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the striatum (35%, P &lt; 0.0001) and in the cortex (44%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared with vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct injection of IL-1beta into the striatum also increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in both the striatum (36%, P &lt; 0.0001) and the cortex (38%, P &lt; 0.0001), whereas injection of IL-1beta into the cortex failed to affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in either the striatum or the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical injection of a higher dose of IL-1beta (20 ng) also failed to affect ischemic damage in either the striatum or the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injection of IL-1beta into the striatum contralateral to the infarction had no effect on striatal damage in the ischemic hemisphere, but did increase cortical damage by 18% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of animals, IL-1beta (2.5 ng) was injected into either the striatum or the cortex, and body temperature was recorded continuously in conscious free-moving animals by remote telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injection of IL-1beta at either site failed to influence body temperature, suggesting that exacerbation of brain damage by striatal injection of IL-1beta is not caused by effects on body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results imply that IL-1beta exacerbates ischemic damage by specific actions in the striatum where it can influence damage at distant sites in the cortex </plain></SENT>
