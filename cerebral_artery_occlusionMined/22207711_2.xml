<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the third most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main therapeutic target is the ischemic penumbra, potentially salvageable brain tissue that dies within the first few hours after blood flow cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, strategies to keep the penumbra alive until reperfusion occurs are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> on cerebral vessels and cerebral perfusion under physiological conditions and in different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This experimental study demonstrates that inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (applied in 30% oxygen/70% air mixture) leads to the formation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> carriers in blood that distribute throughout the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was ascertained by in vivo microscopy in adult mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> does not affect cerebral blood flow, after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> it selectively dilates arterioles in the ischemic penumbra, thereby increasing collateral blood flow and significantly reducing ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This translates into significantly improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were validated in independent laboratories using two different mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in a clinically relevant large animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> thus may provide a completely novel strategy to improve penumbral blood flow and neuronal survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or other ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
