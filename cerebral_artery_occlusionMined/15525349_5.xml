<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) is a unique nerve-injury associated molecule, which was recently identified in a peripheral nerve injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the expression profiles and distribution of DINE in adult rats after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> and prolonged expression of DINE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex and specific nuclei of thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double labeling using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed that DINE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was exclusively expressed in cells that were positive to a neuronal marker NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously established knowledge on neuroanatomical fiber connection suggests that DINE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in areas projecting their axons to or through the core region of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unique expression profile was similar to that of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), which is a marker of nerve-injured neuron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 98% of ATF-3 immunoreactive neurons simultaneously expressed DINE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting that DINE expression is observed in injured neurons of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> as well as PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since DINE expression promotes <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity, our results suggest that DINE may act as a neuroprotective molecule in neurons under ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
