<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: XG-102 (formerly D-JNKI1), a TAT-coupled dextrogyre <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which selectively inhibits the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, is a powerful neuroprotectant in mouse models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) with delayed intracerebroventricular injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether this neuroprotection could also be achieved by intravenous injection of XG-102, which is a more feasible approach for future use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also tested the compatibility of the compound with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), commonly used for intravenous thrombolysis and known to enhance excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male ICR-CD1 mice were subjected to a 30-min-suture MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>XG-102 was injected intravenously in a single dose, 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal slice cultures were subjected to oxygen (5%) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1 mM) deprivation for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rtPA was added after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and before XG-102 administration, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lowest intravenous dose achieving neuroprotection was 0.0003 mg/kg, which reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 48 h from 62 +/- 19 mm(3) (n = 18) for the vehicle-treated group to 18 +/- 9 mm(3) (n = 5, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The behavioral outcome was also significantly improved at two doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of rtPA after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> enhanced the ischemic damage both in vitro and in vivo, but XG-102 was still able to induce a significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single intravenous administration of XG-102 several hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induces a powerful neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>XG-102 protects from ischemic damage in the presence of rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of systemic administration of this promising compound and its compatibility with rtPA are important steps for its development as a drug candidate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
