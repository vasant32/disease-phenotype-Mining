<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When delivered within 1 and in most cases 2 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), mild sensory stimulation (intermittent single whisker stimulation) was shown to be completely neuroprotective 24 h after pMCAO in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, according to assessment with multiple techniques (Lay et al., 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of stimulation treatment on the ischemic cortex, however, has yet to be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we characterize cortical function and perfusion during the 120 min whisker stimulation period in four experimental groups with treatment initiated 0, 1, 2 (protected groups), or 3 h (unprotected group) post-pMCAO using multiple techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to functional imaging, a gradual return of evoked whisker functional representation to baseline levels was initiated with treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and completed within the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evoked neuronal activity and reperfusion to the ischemic area also showed a gradual recovery in protected animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a similar recovery profile was observed in response to treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protected animals, regardless of treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonstimulated pMCAO control group data demonstrate that reperfusion is not spontaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This makes the complete protection observed in the majority of animals stimulated at 2 h post-pMCAO even more surprising, as these animals recovered despite having been in a severely ischemic state for two full hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, when delivered within a 2 h window post-pMCAO, whisker stimulation treatment initiated reperfusion and a gradual recovery of cortical function that was completed or nearly completed within the treatment period </plain></SENT>
