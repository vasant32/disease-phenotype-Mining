<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of implanted BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMSCs were intravenously transplanted at 24 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was evaluated using modified neurological severity score and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling staining were performed to detect neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by ELISA and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant improvement of neurological deficits was found in BMSC-treated rats compared with control animals at 14 and 28 days after MCAo (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation showed that BMSCs treatment significantly promoted neuronal survival and proliferation in the ischemic boundary area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF was predominantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere of BMSC-treated rats compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, transduction of VEGF RNAi lentivirus partially attenuated the above described beneficial effects of systemically administered BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intravenously administrated BMSCs facilitate neurological function, reduce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and promote neuronal proliferation through the release of VEGF </plain></SENT>
