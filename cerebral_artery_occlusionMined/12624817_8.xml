<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the neuroprotective effect of honokiol in rats subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Honokiol was administered intravenously either at fifteen minutes before right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pretreatment groups) or when both common carotid arteries clips were removed (treatment groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was no significant hemodynamic change after intravenous infusion of honokiol at the dosages of 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) g/kg in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, honokiol significantly reduced the total volume of infarction at the doses of 10(-7) or 10(-6) g/kg in both pretreatment and treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that honokiol is a potent neuroprotective agent in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This beneficial effect may be related to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect and anti-platelet aggregation activity </plain></SENT>
