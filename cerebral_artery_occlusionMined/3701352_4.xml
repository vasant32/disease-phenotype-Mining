<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The territory of the middle cerebral artery that failed to fill with a carbon black intravascular marker after intracranial occlusion for 30 minutes in the anaesthetised rat was reduced by 50% by isovolaemic haemodilution to a haematocrit of 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intravenous infusion of 10% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> prevented swelling of the ischaemic hemisphere, though it did not further improve vascular perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings support the use of isovolaemic haemodilution and osmotherapy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aftermath of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
