<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe whether Naomai Yihao (NM) Capsule, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine for regulating the "sea of blood in brain", and bone marrow stromal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation could improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into untreated group, NM group, BMSC group and combination of NM and BMSC group (combined treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats were selected as sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3-, 7- and 14-day reperfusion, behavioral rating scale (BRS) of the rats and histopathology of the cerebral tissue were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD31 in the brain tissue was also measured by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, BRSs of the NM group, BMSC group and combined treatment group were decreased significantly (P=0.000), but there was no interacting effect between NM and BMSC transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untreated group, the numbers of CD31 positive cells in NM group, BMSC group and combined treatment group were increased significantly (P=0.000), and there were interacting effects among NM, BMSC transplantation, and the observation time (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 14-day reperfusion, combination of NM and BMSC transplantation could largely increase the number of CD31 positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NM is able to promote the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurological impairment improvement in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of rats which are administered with BMSC transplantation, and the effect is reinforced with the extension of treatment time </plain></SENT>
