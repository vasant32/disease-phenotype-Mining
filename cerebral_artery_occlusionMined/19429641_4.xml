<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> is thought to more closely mimic the temporal events of an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method provides rapid occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and a gradual reperfusion that lasts for 16-22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether systemic administration of an ARB prior to ET-1-induced MCAO would provide cerebroprotection during this model of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injection of 3 microl of 80 microM ET-1 adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> resulted in complete occlusion of the vessel that resolved over a period of 30-40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following ET-1-inducedMCAO, rats had significant neurological impairment, as well as an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> that consisted of 30% of the ipsilateral grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic pretreatment with 0.2 mg kg(-1) day(-1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> for 7 days attenuated both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the neurological deficits caused by ET-1-induced MCAO without altering blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the cerebroprotective properties of ARBs during ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and validates the ET-1-induced MCAO model for examination of the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
