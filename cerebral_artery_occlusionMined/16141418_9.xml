<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate preliminarily efficacy and safety of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> combined with mechanical clot disruption and urokinase in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of a major cerebral artery were treated with an intravenous bolus injection of the platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and by endovascular procedures including mechanical thrombolysis and locally delivered urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 cases, 9 involved angioplasty and 2 only microcatheter and microguidewire manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 7 patients with internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated within 6 hours and 4 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated within 12 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the interventional procedure, vessel recanalization was partial (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> grade flow 2 [TIMI 2]) in 7 patients and absent or insufficient in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients but 1 improved substantially, and on control angiography, the occluded vessel was totally patent (TIMI 3) in 10 of the 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with partial recanalization did not improve and died 3 months later from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> nor systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> requiring blood transfusion occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At discharge, median NIHSS score was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-month outcome was excellent in 8 patients (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0 to 1), good in 2 patients (mRS 2), and poor in 1 patient (mRS 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> with intra-arterial mechanical clot disruption and urokinase may be successful in reopening an occluded major cerebral vessel without increasing the hemorrhagic risk and with good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This strategy cannot be recommended as the systematic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> until tested in a controlled study design </plain></SENT>
