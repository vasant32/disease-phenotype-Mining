<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the role of CB in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, we hypothesized that removal of CB would exacerbate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with intact CB and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with surgically removed CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral CB was removed in animals assigned to treatment group exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with surgically removed CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests, using the elevated body swing test, were conducted at days 1-3 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was visualized by TTC staining on day 3 post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data revealed no significant differences in behavioral deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, CB cell suspension grafts or control adult tissue grafts were intracerebally transplanted into the ischemic penumbra immediately (within 1 h) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results revealed significant reduction of behavioral deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, accompanied by increased levels of neurotrophic factors, as detected by ELISA, in transplanted ischemic striatum collected from CB-grafted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that surgical resection of CB in the periphery did not alter <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology; however, CB when made available in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, via intracerebral transplantation, could protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> possibly through the synergistic release of neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study extends the use of CB as efficacious graft source for transplantation </plain></SENT>
