<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A profound bilateral impairment in pellet recovery, with a concomitant increase in pellet displacement, was observed in the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast the striatal lesion group exhibited a primarily contralateral impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings provide both further insight into the control of unilateral motor function and a reliable behavioural endpoint for the assessment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
