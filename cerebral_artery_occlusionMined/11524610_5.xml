<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate effect of assuming of upright posture on brain hemodynamics in patients with unilateral internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), local tissue oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and postural changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during supine and sitting conditions were examined using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with (15)O-gas steady-state method and H(2)(15)O autoradiographic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at relatively early stages participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regions of interest method was used for analyzing levels of perfusion and oxygen metabolic parameters, and postural rCBF change within MCAO group was investigated using statistical parametric mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Region of interest analyses showed significant rCBF reduction in the cortical and subcortical regions distal to the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in CAO patients during sitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses showed that magnitudes of rCBF reduction in those areas were correlated positively with OEF values and inversely with metabolic rates of oxygen (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical parametric mapping for MCAO patients demonstrated further rCBF reduction by sitting in the occlusion-side <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current study suggested that assumption of upright posture could exert an adverse effect on local perfusion in hemodynamically compromised patients with major cerebral vessel occlusion, possibly caused by impairment of local autoregulation </plain></SENT>
