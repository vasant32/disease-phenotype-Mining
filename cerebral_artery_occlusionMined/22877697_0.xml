<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous report, we showed that HMGB1 is massively released during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> damaging process in the postischemic brain and triggers inflammatory processes and induces neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also reported a robust neuroprotection of intranasally delivered HMGB1 siRNA in the postischemic rat brain (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), 60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of intranasally delivered HMGB1 binding heptamer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (HBHP; HMSKPVQ), which was selected using a phage display approach, in the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pull-down assay using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labeled HBHP showed that HBHP binds directly to HMGB1, specifically to HMGB1 A box, confirming HMGB1/HBHP interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBHP significantly suppressed HMGB1-mediated neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in primary cortical cultures and HMGB1/HBHP binding was detected in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-conditioned culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a heptamer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> composed of a scrambled sequence of the seven amino acids in HBHP failed to bind HMGB1 and had no protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HBHP (300 ng) delivered intranasally at 30 min before MCAO significantly suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the postischemic rat brain (maximal reduction by 41.8Â±5.4%) and ameliorated neurological and behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, scrambled heptamer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> had no protective effect at the same dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together these results suggest that intranasal HBHP ameliorates neuronal damage in the ischemic brain by binding HMGB1, which might inhibit the function of HMGB1 as an endogenous danger signal molecule </plain></SENT>
