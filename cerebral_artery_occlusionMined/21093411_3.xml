<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> against cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">Baicalin</z:chebi> at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg was intravenously injected after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the neurological deficit was scored and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) staining was performed to analyze the histopathological changes of cortex and hippocampus neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the levels of NF-κB p65 in ischemic cortexes by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the neurological deficit scores were significantly decreased from 2.0 ± 0.7 to 1.2 ± 0.4 and the volume of infarction was reduced by 25% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination showed that the increase of neurons with pycnotic shape and condensed nuclear in cortex and hippocampus were not observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further examination showed that NF-κB p65 in cortex was increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury, indicating the molecular mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of NF-κB p65 was decreased by 73% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> might be useful as a potential neuroprotective agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> may relate to inhibition of NF-κB p65 </plain></SENT>
