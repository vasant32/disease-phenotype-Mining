<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using tissue engineering, a complex of neural stem cells (NSCs) and collagen type I was transplanted for the therapy of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NSCs from E14 d rats were dissociated and cultured by neurosphere formation in serum-free medium in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), then seeded onto collagen to measure cell adhesive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BrdU was added to the culture medium to label the NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats (n=100) were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of reperfusion, rats were assigned randomly to five groups: NSCs-collagen repair group, NSCs repair group, unseeded collagen repair group, MCAO medium group, and sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological, immunohistological and electronic microscope assessments were performed to examine the effects of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scanning electronic microscopy showed that NSCs assemble in the pores of collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3, 7, 15, and 30 d after transplantation of the NSC-collagen complex, some of the engrafted NSCs survive, differentiate and form synapses in the brains of rats subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six d after transplantation of the NSC-collagen complex into the brains of ischemic rats, the collagen began to degrade; 30 d after transplantation, the collagen had degraded completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The implantation of NSCs and type I collagen facilitated the structural and functional recovery of neural tissue following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
