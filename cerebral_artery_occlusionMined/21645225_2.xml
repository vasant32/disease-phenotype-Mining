<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:  Currently there is no approved <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is largely because of concern for hemorrhagic complications, and suggests a critical need for safer <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Solulin is a soluble analog of the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin, able to bind free thrombin and convert it to an activator of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:  Solulin was tested for its ability to inhibit middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced by photothrombosis, and to restore <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> patency after establishment of stable occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:  Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser Doppler for 1.5 h after occlusion and again 72 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:  Solulin treatment 30 min before <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> resulted in an approximately 50% increase in time to form a stable occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When administered 30 or 60 min after MCAO, Solulin significantly improved CBF within 90 min of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the vehicle-treated mice showed restoration of CBF in the first 90 min and only 17% did so by 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Solulin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and was well tolerated with no overt <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> observed in any treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies in mice homozygous for the factor (F)V Leiden mutation, suggest that Solulin's efficacy derives primarily from the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of the thrombin-Solulin complex and not from direct anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects of Solulin or activated protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:  Our data indicate that Solulin is a safe and effective <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> that is able to antagonize active <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
