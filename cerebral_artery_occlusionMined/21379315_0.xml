<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the in vitro study, we initially exposed primary rat cells to the established oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model followed by reperfusion under normoxic conditions, then added different cacao and sage concentrations to the cell culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trypan blue cell viability results revealed specific cacao and sage dosages exerted significant therapeutic effects against OGD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared to cultured cells treated with extract vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We next embarked on testing the therapeutic effects of cacao and sage in an in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when extract treatment commenced either prior to or after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area coupled with better performance in routine motor and neurological tasks were demonstrated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals that received cacao or sage extracts prior to MCAo compared to those that received the extracts or vehicle after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, the present results demonstrate that neuroprotective effects were afforded by plant extract treatment, and that the in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> paradigm approximates in vivo efficacy when considering prophylactic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
