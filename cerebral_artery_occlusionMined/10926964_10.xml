<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early and accurate assessments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> allow therapy to be tailored to individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the feasibility of using a novel method for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) of ischemic tissue based on MRI after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the regional correlations between CBF and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were investigated in the regions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CBF and CBV were measured before and after MCAO or reperfusion by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in 13 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Just after the PET scans, CBF and CBV were measured by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> bolus tracking and were compared with results obtained by PET at 6 hours after permanent MCAO or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction was verified histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> method yielded parametric CBF and CBV maps with tissue contrast in good agreement with parametric PET images, which demonstrated hypoperfused and hyperperfused areas after MCAO or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both MRI and PET technology showed that CBF values below 60% of the contralateral value induced a reduction of CBV, which committed the tissue to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> method provides accurate measurement of CBF and CBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and hence gives useful information for planning the appropriate therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
