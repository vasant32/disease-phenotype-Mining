<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in transporter proteins were also assessed by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies to GLT-1 and GLAST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, GLT-1 mRNA expression was decreased significantly in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex compared to the sham-operated brains (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in GLAST or EAAC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression between MCAO and sham-operated brains </plain></SENT>
