<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reduced LCGU in the entire ipsilateral cortex, the greatest reduction being in the lateral parts of the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LCGU was slightly reduced in the contralateral cortex; this reduction was considered to be caused by diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxiracetam was administered intraperitoneally for 3 days prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral cortex, LCGU reduction was minimized in the ischemic center areas by oxiracetam at a dose of 400 mg/kg and in more extensive areas, by a dose of 800 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, oxiracetam at a dose of 800 mg/kg enhanced metabolism impaired by diaschisis in the caudal areas of the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that oxiracetam minimizes the reduction of brain function induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may therefore be useful in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
