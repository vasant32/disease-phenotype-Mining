<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to examine whether the changes of protein expression of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transporters in the ischemic penumbra are associated with the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and/or brain cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was made by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in rats and the changes of protein expression of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transporters in the ischemic penumbra were examined by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive infarction was observed in the frontal and parietal cortical and subcortical areas at 3 and 6h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting analyses revealed significantly increased expressions of electrogenic NBC (241 +/- 11% at 3 h and 154 +/- 9% at 6 h, P &lt; 0.05) and NHE1 (144 +/- 3% at 3 h and 170 +/- 9% at 6 h, P &lt; 0.05), compared with sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Na-K-ATPase expression (78 +/- 6% at 3 h and 85 +/- 3% at 6 h, P &lt; 0.05) was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of NCX1 was unchanged at 3 h, but was significantly increased at 6 h (141 +/- 3%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expressions of neuronal (NeuN) and astroglial cell (GFAP) proteins were decreased, whereas the expression of oligodendrocyte protein (CNPase) was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the selectively increased expressions of NHE1, electrogenic NBC, and NCX1 and decreased expression of Na-K-ATPase in the ischemic penumbra are likely to contribute to the secondary brain cell damages presumably through intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> accumulation, cell swelling, and intracellular Ca(2+) overload </plain></SENT>
