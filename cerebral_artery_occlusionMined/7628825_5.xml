<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effects of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> efflux in the parietal cortex using the microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dialysis probe implantation itself provoked a delayed, prolonged and vigorous release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">Spermidine</z:chebi> release returned to stable baseline levels within 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">Putrescine</z:chebi> release also returned to lower levels within this time period but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> levels in the dialysate fluctuated dramatically in individual animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the underlying effects of the dialysis probe (likely a reflection of traumatic cerebral damage and stimulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> metabolism and release within the immediate vicinity of the dialysis probe), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was performed 48 hours after probe implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion persistently (5/5 animals) resulted in a significant increase in cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> efflux, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, magnitude and duration of this increased release was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">Putrescine</z:chebi> efflux was significantly increased in 2/5 animals with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion but the increase in release was similar to the spontaneous fluctuations observed in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">Spermine</z:chebi> was not detectable in cortical dialysates of control or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">Spermidine</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> is consistently released from the parietal cortex following permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and may contribute to ischaemic neuropathology either through its effects at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor or via direct, and as yet uncharacterised, neurotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
