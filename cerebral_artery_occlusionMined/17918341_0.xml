<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments were carried out on inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs were isolated, expanded in cultute and labeled with vital <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> PKH-26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), followed by injection of 5 x 10(6) rat MSCs into the tail vein 3 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control group animals received PBS injection (negative control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy results were estimated by the following parameters: behavioral and neurological testing, the brain injure area, the state of damaged region "border" zone and the vessels quantity in the "borden" area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was shown that control group animals (PBS injection) did not restore their initial behavioral and neurological state, while the experimental group animals (MSCs injection) showed the same parameters as intact rats at 2-3 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of the damaged region in the control group was approximately 1.5 as large as in the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The damage in the experimental group was limited to neocortex; caudate nucleus, capsula externa and piriform cortex remained uninjured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small vessels quantity in the "border" regions was twine higher compared to control group and was approximately equal to an intact brain vessel number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was shown for the first time that after MSCs transplantation the vessels quantity in the neocortex and caudate putamen of contralateral hemisphere was twice as much as in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the MSCs transplantation definitely exerted a positive influence upon the brain tissue reparation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
