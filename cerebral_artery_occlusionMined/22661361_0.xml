<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> are generally considered to aggravate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury, we investigated their effects on LXA(4)-mediated neuroprotection by studying middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)/reperfusion in rats and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)/recovery in neonatal rat astrocyte primary cultures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total 5-LOX expression did not change, regardless of treatment, but LXA(4) could inhibit nuclear translocation induced by MCAO or OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that LXA(4) inhibits the upregulation of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> B(4) (LTB(4)) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> C(4) (LTC(4)) and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) induced by MCAO or OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of the 38-kDa protein kinase (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was not altered throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of LXA(4) are probably achieved by anti-inflammatory mechanisms that are partly mediated by ALXR and through an ERK signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
