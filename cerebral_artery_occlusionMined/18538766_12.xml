<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection depends critically upon the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with longer treatments often being more efficacious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ideal treatment duration is not known for most insults and this knowledge would facilitate clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared 12, 24 and 48 h of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C vs. normothermia) initiated 1 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), which was produced by permanent occlusion of the carotid arteries and cauterization of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral recovery and lesion volume were determined 7 days after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three treatments significantly and equally attenuated neurological deficits (e.g., forelimb placing response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, stepping error rate in the horizontal ladder test was significantly reduced only by the 24-h (18.7%) and 48-h treatments (11.7%) compared to normothermic rats (34.4%), and the 48-h treatment was significantly better than the 12-h treatment (28.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, brain injury was significantly reduced by 24-h (78.8 mm(3) lesion volume) and 48-h (66.8 mm(3)) treatments compared to normothermia (142.6 mm(3)), and the 48-h treatment was significantly better than the 12-h duration (114.6 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was measured via wet-dry weight measurements and significantly reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (e.g., from 83.7% water in the injured cortex of normothermic rats to 81.4% in rats cooled for one day), but for this there were no significant duration effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment provides superior protection overall, but this is not explained by reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
