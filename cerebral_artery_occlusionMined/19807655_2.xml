<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, our aim is to determine human GM-CSF plasma level in control subjects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and its relationship to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who received thrombolytic therapy within the first three hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and nineteen healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn before tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a group of thirteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> blood samples were also obtained one hour after t-PA treatment, at 24 hours of symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, at discharge and at three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity and neurological outcome was assessed by National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and functional outcome were scored by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline GM-CSF level was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in healthy controls (17.8 pg/ml vs 12.8 pg/ml); p&lt;0.0001 and was positively correlated with NIHSS score at 12 hours (R=0.3, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was detected with functional status at three months measured by mRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temporary profile of GM-CSF level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients gradually decreases from admission to three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher plasma endogenous GM-CSF level is found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no relation was found with a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary for elucidating the role of GM-CSF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
