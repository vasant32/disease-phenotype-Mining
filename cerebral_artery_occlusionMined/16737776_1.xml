<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological recording of CSD has been used for monitoring the penumbral zone, but with an inherently low spatial resolution; consequently, optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) was applied to characterize the spontaneous CSD waves following permanent left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats under alpha-chloralose/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides the previous report about the regional variation of optical reflectance during spontaneous CSD following MCAO, the origin site of CSD was easily determined using OISI with the benefit of high resolution in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those origin points (n = 82) were dynamically located in the ipsilateral hemisphere cortex: sometimes outside of the 6 mm x 8 mm observation area in the parietal cortex (n = 19, 23%), and sometimes inside (n = 63, 77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data showed a general trend towards the medial cortex (0.40 +/- 0.15 mm per CSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the lateral cortex of the rat brain proved to be infarcted with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining after 4 h occlusion, the migration of the origin sites implied a growth of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, the determination of origins of spontaneous CSD using OISI would contribute to the continued study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
