<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> treatment (isradipine) following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 33 +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The somatosensory cortex representing the forepaws was spared from infarction; however, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was significantly reduced in this area 24 hr following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neural function was assessed at days 1, 2, 5, and 12 following pMCAO by fMRI using electrical stimulation of both forepaws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-treated rats did not show fMRI responses in the infarcted somatosensory cortex throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several of the isradipine-treated animals displayed functional recovery in the cytoprotected cortex at days 5 (3/5 rats) and 12 (5/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations with fMRI signals showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T2 and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the respective brain areas are necessary, but not sufficient prerequisites for functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recovery of neural function is associated with normalization of CBF in the cytoprotected brain area </plain></SENT>
