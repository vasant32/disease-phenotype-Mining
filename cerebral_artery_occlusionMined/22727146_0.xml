<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using wireless polysomnographic recordings, this study aimed to investigate the long-term effects on sleep patterns and autonomic function in free moving rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sleep pattern and heart rate variability (HRV) of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7-10days, the rats were divided into two groups: an MCAO group (n=8) and a sham surgery group (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with shams, MCAO rats showed decreased accumulated quiet sleep (QS) time over 24h during the 3rd week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time percentage, duration and delta power of QS were also significantly decreased in the MCAO group during the dark period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline, there were significant increases in the parasympathetic-associated HRV measures in the sham group, including the total power (TP), high frequency power (HF) and lower frequency power (LF), throughout the post-operative weeks (primarily the 2nd and 3rd weeks), reflecting a developmental increase of parasympathetic modulation; the normalized LF and the LF-HF ratio were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In great contrast, however, most of the HRV measures in the MCAO group were not significantly changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study showed that the long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> injury involve retardation of the establishment of parasympathetic enhancement and disturbance of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sleep-wake cycle </plain></SENT>
