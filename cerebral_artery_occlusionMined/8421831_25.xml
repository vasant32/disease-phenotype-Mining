<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood flow was measured by using the hydrogen clearance method, and the brains were examined histologically to assess ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By Koizumi's method profound reduction in cerebral blood flow was achieved in 28 of 30 rats (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory was 10.7 (95% confidence interval, 9.9-11.5) ml/100 g per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Longa's method reduction in cerebral blood flow was achieved in only 29 of 52 rats (56%), and in these animals mean cerebral blood flow was 33 (95% confidence interval, 28.3-33.7) ml/100 g per minute (p &lt; 0.001 compared with Koizumi's method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was reduced to &lt; 16 ml/100 g per minute in only seven animals (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By Koizumi's method the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is more profound, occlusion is achieved in a much higher proportion of cases, and the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the intracranial internal carotid is much less frequent than by Longa's method </plain></SENT>
