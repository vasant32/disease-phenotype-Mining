<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we considered the possibility that Ang-(1-7) may exert beneficial effects against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> damage and neurological deficits produced by cerebral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the effects of central administration of Ang-(1-7) or pharmacological activation of ACE2 on the cerebral damage and behavioural deficits elicited by endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study demonstrated that intracerebroventricular infusion of either Ang-(1-7) or an ACE2 activator, diminazine aceturate (DIZE), prior to and following ET-1-induced MCAO significantly attenuated the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological deficits measured 72 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These beneficial actions of Ang-(1-7) and DIZE were reversed by co-intracerebroventricular administration of the Mas receptor inhibitor, A-779 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the Ang-(1-7) nor the DIZE treatments altered the reduction in cerebral blood flow elicited by ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, intracerebroventricular administration of Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced the increase in inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression within the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> that occurs following ET-1-induced MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of cerebroprotective properties of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis during ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and suggests that the mechanism of the Ang-(1-7) protective action includes blunting of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression </plain></SENT>
