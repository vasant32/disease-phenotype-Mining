<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects have been related to inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is activated through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MLN519 to alter the expression of several inflammatory genes under the control of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by vehicle or MLN519 (1.0 g/kg, i.v.) treatment immediately after reperfusion of blood to the brain at 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was evaluated 3-72 h post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most striking effects of intravenous treatment with MLN519 were associated with reductions in ICAM-1 expression at 3 h followed by reductions in E-selectin (12-72 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Less dramatic reductions were observed in IL-1Beta (3-24 h) and TNF-Alpha (24 h) with no apparent effects on IL-6 and VCAM-1 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the genes most dramatically affected by MLN519 had highest expression in endothelial cells and leukocytes (E-selectin, ICAM-1),indicating that these cell types may be the primary targets of intravenously delivered MLN519 treatment </plain></SENT>
