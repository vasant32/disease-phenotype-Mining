<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, plasma miRNAs have been investigated as biomarkers for various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, miRNA array analysis in various tissues showed that miR-124 is almost exclusively expressed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and neuronal cells, suggesting that it might be useful as a potential biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether plasma concentrations of brain-specific miRNA can serve as a biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, where the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was modeled by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of miR-124 were significantly elevated at 6 h, and remained elevated at 48 h after MCAO introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, plasma concentration of miR-124 provides a promising candidate biomarker for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
