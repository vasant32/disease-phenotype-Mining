<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment on the expression of IL-1beta and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, the activity of NF-kB, and the signaling pathways related to NF-kB activation in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression, determined using RT-PCR, was enhanced by pMCAO; this effect was inhibited by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> abolished the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced activation of NF-kB observed in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of signal transduction pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), SAPK/JNK 46/54 and p38, indicated that only ERK1/2 phosphorylation was enhanced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and this activation was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ERK1/2-inhibitor, U0126, reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> but not cytokine induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor</z:chebi> induces its effect in the protection of ischemic brain damage with a more complex mechanism which also involve anti-inflammatory properties rather than simple inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
