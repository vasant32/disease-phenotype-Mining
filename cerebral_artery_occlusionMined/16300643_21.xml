<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>K-means cluster analysis revealed two distinct biphasic gene expression patterns that contained 44 genes (including 18 immediate early genes), involved in cell signaling and plasticity (i.e. MAP2K7, Sprouty2, Irs-2, Homer1, GPRC5B, Grasp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first gene induction phase occurred at 0-3 h of reperfusion, and the second at 9-15 h, and was validated by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four gene clusters displayed a progressive increase in expression over time and included 50 genes linked to cell motility, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis and trafficking (i.e. ApoD, NPC1, G3P-dehydrogenase1, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> kinase) or cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-regulating genes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> CLIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a biphasic transcriptional up-regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways occurs in surviving tissue, concomitant with a progressive and persistent activation of cell proliferation signifying tissue regeneration, which provide the means for cell survival and postischemic brain plasticity </plain></SENT>
