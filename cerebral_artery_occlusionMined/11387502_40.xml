<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuroprotection with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) requires direct injection into the brain owing to poor transport of the neurotrophin through the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies investigate whether BDNF alone or conjugated to a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> drug targeting system is neuroprotective in focal, reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> after delayed intravenous administration at 60 or 120 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BDNF was conjugated to the OX26 murine monoclonal antibody to the rat transferrin receptor, which undergoes transport into brain from blood via the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> transferrin receptor transcytosis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>- ventilated animals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood sugar, the brain was reperfused, and either BDNF or the BDNF/OX26 conjugate was administered as a single intravenous injection at a dose of 50 microg per rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the intravenous administration of unconjugated BDNF, there was no neuroprotection on the basis of analysis of brain at either 24 hours or 7 days after a 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a 68% and 70% reduction in cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume at 24 hours and 7 days, respectively, after intravenous administration of 50 microg per rat of the BDNF conjugate (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No effects on subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate marked neuroprotection in focal, transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> with a single, delayed intravenous injection of BDNF if the neurotrophin is conjugated to a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> drug targeting system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection is long lasting and persists for at least 7 days after a 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
