<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals in reperfusion injury in transgenic mice overexpressing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model of intraluminal blockade of middle cerebral artery that produced both cortical and striatal infarction, we now further examined the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarction</z:e> after reperfusion in transgenic mice overexpressing human CuZn-SOD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transgenic mice of strain Tg HS/SF-218, carrying human SOD-1 genes, and nontransgenic littermates were anesthetized with chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (350 mg/kg IP) and xylazine (4 mg/kg IP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters were maintained at a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range using a 30% O2/70% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> gas mixture inserted via an inhalation mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was maintained at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C by using a heating pad throughout the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was achieved with a 5-0 rounded nylon suture placed within the internal cerebral artery for 3 hours followed by the removal of the suture to allow reperfusion for another 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in brain slices and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological deficit, cortical blood flow, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels were measured in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the nontransgenic mice, the infarcted areas were significantly decreased in coronal slices from transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (in cubic millimeters) was reduced by 26% in transgenic mice after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in transgenic mice closely paralleled the reduced neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the suture to block blood supply to the middle cerebral artery territory produced a rapid decrease in the relative surface blood flow in the ipsilateral core and the peri-ischemic (penumbra) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the local cerebral blood flow in the ischemic core or the penumbra areas between the transgenic and nontransgenic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the level of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in the penumbra area was significantly higher in transgenic mice than in nontransgenic mice, whereas there was no difference in the reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels in the ischemic core between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in reperfusion injury after a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits is not dependent on the changes in cerebral blood flow but rather correlate with reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the ischemic brain tissue, which was indicated by the relatively high levels of endogenous reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
