<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption resulting from excessive neurovascular proteolysis by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is closely associated with hemorrhagic transformation events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (NBO) treatment reduces MMP-9 increase in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether NBO could attenuate MMP-9-mediated early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to NBO (95% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) or normoxia (30% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) during 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 3-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NBO-treated rats showed a significant reduction in Evan's blue extravasation in the ischemic hemisphere compared with normoxic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topographically, Evan's blue leakage was mainly seen in the subcortical regions including the striatum, which was accompanied by increased gelatinolytic activity and reduced immunostaining for tight-junction protein, occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased gelatinolytic activities and occludin protein loss were also observed in isolated ischemic microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gel gelatin zymography identified that MMP-9 was the main enzymatic source in the cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incubation of brain slices or isolated microvessels with purified MMP-9 revealed specific degradation of occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of MMP-9 by NBO or MMP-inhibitor, BB1101, significantly reduced occludin protein loss in ischemic microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NBO attenuates early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, and inhibition of MMP-9-mediated occludin degradation is an important mechanism for this protection </plain></SENT>
