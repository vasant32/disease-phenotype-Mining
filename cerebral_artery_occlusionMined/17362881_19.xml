<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether compensatory reinnervation in the corticospinal tract (CST) and the corticorubral tract (CRT) is enhanced by the administration of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control, n=7) or 3x10(6) BMSCs in PBS (n=8) were injected into a tail vein at 1 day postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CST of the left sensorimotor cortices was labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi> 2 days prior to MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 28 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain and spinal cord were removed and processed for vibratome sections for laser-scanning confocal analysis and paraffin sections for immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> rats (n=4) exhibited a predominantly unilateral pattern of innervation of CST and CRT axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, bilateral innervation occurred through axonal sprouting of the uninjured CRT and CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of BMSCs significantly increased the axonal restructuring on the de-afferented red nucleus and the denervated spinal motoneurons (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMSC treatment also significantly increased synaptic proteins in the denervated motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results were highly correlated with improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (r&gt;0.81, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the transplantation of BMSCs enhances axonal sprouting and rewiring into the denervated spinal cord which may facilitate functional recovery after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
