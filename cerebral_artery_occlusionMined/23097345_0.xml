<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of L-theanine (1 and 4 mg/kg) administered at 3, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion in the rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effect of L-theanine on brain injury caused by exogenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35595">isoxazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi>/kainate receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 30-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 48-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were determined at the end of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 and 12 h, but not at 24 h of reperfusion, L-theanine substantially reduced the size of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was improved when L-theanine was administered 3, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeated intrastriatal injections of L-theanine at a total dose of 800 µg/kg during reperfusion prevented brain injury caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, L-theanine at reperfusion exerts neuroprotective effect in the in vivo rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local treatment with L-theanine at reperfusion prevents <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-mediated brain injury </plain></SENT>
