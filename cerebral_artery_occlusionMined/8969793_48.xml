<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Over the past several years, it has been demonstrated that mild intraischemic or immediate postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> worsens ischemic outcome in models of global and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> are commonly seen in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis tested in this study was that a brief hyperthermic period, even when occurring days after an ischemic insult, has detrimental effects on the pathological outcome of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 60 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by insertion of an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, awake rats were subjected to temperature modulation for 3 hours in a heating chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain temperature was equilibrated to either 37 degrees C to 38 degrees C, or 40 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in rectal temperature and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration were evaluated during and just after temperature modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three days after temperature modulation, brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In animals with 40 degrees C <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, cortical and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were markedly greater (92.2 +/- 63.1 and 126.5 +/- 72.3 mm3 [mean +/- SD], respectively) than in normothermic rats (14.4 +/- 12.7 and 42.4 +/- 19.2 mm3) and in animals with 39 degrees C <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (16.5 +/- 28.7 and 40.9 +/- 34.3 mm3) (P &lt; .05), whereas there was no significant difference between normothermic and 39 degrees C hyperthermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, animals with 40 degrees C <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> displayed worsened neurological scores compared with normothermic and 39 degrees C hyperthermic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the 39 degrees C <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> group, rectal temperatures were significantly lower (by 0.2 degree C to 0.5 degree C) than brain temperatures throughout the modulation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide evidence that, after a transient focal ischemic insult, the postischemic brain becomes abnormally sensitive to the effects of delayed temperature elevation, even of moderate degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The threshold for aggravation of ischemic injury by delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> appears to be approximately 40 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Body-temperature measurements, in both awake and anesthetized animals, may not accurately reflect brain temperature under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present study stresses that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of even moderate degree in the days following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> may markedly exacerbate brain injury </plain></SENT>
