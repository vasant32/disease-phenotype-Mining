<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The behavioral and neurochemical changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in rats were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One month after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 23 rats were unable to solve a radial eight-arm maze task during an entire 1-month period, whereas seven rats were able to solve this task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three months after occlusion, 19 MCA-occluded rats failed to solve the task successfully again for at least 1 month (the cognitively impaired rats), whereas 11 MCA-occluded rats were able to solve it (the cognitively unimpaired rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats that underwent behavioral testing were examined for any changes in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) levels in the hippocampus using HPLC with electrochemical detection or the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the population spike of the hippocampal CA1 field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical distribution of either the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the hippocampus of the cognitively impaired rats was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cognitively impaired rats, neither the suppression of the induction of LTP, nor the degradation of MAP2, nor the increase in the GFAP immunoreactivity was observed in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> in the hippocampus did not change significantly among the cognitively impaired, unimpaired, and the sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is capable of producing long-term spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbance</z:e> in rats without any evidence of neurobiological damage in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
