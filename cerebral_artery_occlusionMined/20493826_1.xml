<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study seeks to determine the spatiotemporal association of several axonal guidance signaling molecules with membrane rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These molecules are Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), Fer Kinase, and collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), which are known to have important functions in axonal outgrowth and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to sham or a 1h unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by a time course of reperfusion up to 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain cortices were separated and membrane rafts were extracted based on their insolubility in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 and separation by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradient fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the early and transient induction of NRP-1 and CRMP-2 in membrane rafts in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, in contrast to an early, but sustained elevation of Fer kinase and other CRMPs (1, 3, 4, 5) in response to unilateral MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that NRP1/Fer kinase/CRMP-2 co-localize in membrane rafts early during ischemic injury suggests that the membrane rafts may form a scaffold to support and initiate NRP1/Fer/CRMP-2-mediated signal transduction in neuronal damage response during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further understanding of the time-specific and membrane domain-specific protein-protein interaction may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
