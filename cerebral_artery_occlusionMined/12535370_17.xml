<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) on ischemic injury in the rat model of middle cerebral artery suture occlusion and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Just before reperfusion, C1-INH (50 international units/kg) (C1-INH group, n = 19) or saline solution (control group, n = 17) was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters (arterial blood gas values, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate) and local cerebral blood flow were recorded during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were killed, and assessments of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> with a myeloperoxidase activity assay and histological analyses with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The physiological parameters and local cerebral blood flow values were not significantly different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume was significantly smaller and the myeloperoxidase activity was significantly lower in the C1-INH group (84.9 +/- 69.1 mm(3) and 0.40 +/- 0.29 units/g, respectively) than in the control group (202.3 +/- 98.3 mm(3) and 1.41 +/- 0.44 units/g, respectively) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activities were strongly correlated with infarction volumes (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that C1-INH reduced polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation and neuronal damage in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
