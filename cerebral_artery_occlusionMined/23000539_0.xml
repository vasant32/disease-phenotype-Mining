<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=90) were randomly assigned to sham operation, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and TDCS groups, and underwent sham operation, unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) electrocoagulation, and unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> electrocoagulation plus TDCS (daily anodal and cathodal 10 Hz, 0.1 mA TDCS for 30 min beginning day 1 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor function was assessed using the beam walking test (BWT), and density of dendritic spines (DS) and PX1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were compared among groups on days 3, 7, and 14 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TDCS significantly improved motor function on days 7 and 14 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as indicated by reduced BWT scores compared with the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The density of DS was decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the TDCS group had increased DS density compared with the MCAO group on days 3, 7, and 14 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TDCS increased the DS density after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, indicating that it may promote neural plasticity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
