<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental models, systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> administration in male rats has been shown to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the insular cortex as well as prevent sympathoexcitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The central nucleus of the amygdala has been postulated to mediate sympathoexcitatory output from the insular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore set out to determine if endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels within the central nucleus of the amygdala are altered following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and if microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> into the central nucleus of the amygdala modulates autonomic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> concentrations were not altered by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (22.86+/-0.14 pg/ml vs. 21.24+/-0.33 pg/ml; P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> concentrations in the central nucleus of the amygdala increased significantly following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (from 20.83+/-0.54 pg/ml to 76.67+/-1.59 pg/ml; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local infusion of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi>, into the central nucleus of the amygdala at the time of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> prevented the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> concentration suggesting that this increase was dependent on aromatization from <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bilateral microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> (0.5 microM in 200 nl) directly into the central nucleus of the amygdala significantly decreased arterial pressure and sympathetic tone and increased baroreflex sensitivity, and these effects were enhanced following co-injection with either an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> or non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results suggest that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> within the central nucleus of the amygdala and that this enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> level may act to attenuate overstimulation of central nucleus of the amygdala neurons to prevent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
