<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> administration can improve oxygenation, oxygen availability (aO2) and local cortical blood flow (ICBF) were measured in cats before and during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using 10 platinum electrodes distributed over the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> anesthesia was used during the surgical preparation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> with a relaxant thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 15 to 30 min of MCAO, 50 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> was infused slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measured from electrodes in severely ischemic cortex, aO2 increased if the blood pressure was maintained with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals in which no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> was given showed no change in aO2 over the same period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In areas of cortex not affected by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the aO2 did not change from control values despite a decrease in blood flow from 72.7 +/- 49.8 to 48.9 +/- 26.7 ml/min/100 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> appears to decrease ICBF and metabolism proportionally in well perfused cortex so that aO2 remains constant, while improving the flow to metabolism ratio in poorly perfused cortex so that aO2 rises </plain></SENT>
