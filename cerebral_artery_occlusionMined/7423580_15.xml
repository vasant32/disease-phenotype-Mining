<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was 2 hours followed by 2 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into 2 groups according to the severity of the observed histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe cortical damage was observed in 8 cats (Group A), and, in the remaining 16 cats, little or no cortical damage was seen (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between these 2 groups in the average rCBF values during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During recirculation, there was a prompt and uniform recovery of rCBF in animals in group B but a marked diversity; of rCBF ranging from hyperemia to oligemia in animals in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This diversity of rCBF reflects inhomogenous blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study indicates potential hazards for surgical revascularization in the aute stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when brain damage has progressed beyond a certain level </plain></SENT>
