<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted nuclear magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to detect early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related alterations in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of whether the observed increase in signal intensity is correlated with changes in cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion images were recorded and compared with the regional concentration of cerebral metabolites and with histology of identical planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven anesthetized Fischer rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T1, T2, and diffusion images (b factors ranging from 0 to 1500 s/mm2) were measured in three to five planes after 7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, brains were frozen in situ for histology and quantitative bioluminescence imaging of ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and for fluorescence imaging of tissue pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the apparent diffusion coefficient was reduced from 615 +/- 97 x 10(-6).mm2.s-1 (contralateral brain) to 359 +/- 42 x 10(-6).mm2.s-1 (ischemic brain; mean +/- SD, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A precise topical coincidence was demonstrated between changes in nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion images, pattern of histological damage, ATP-depleted areas, and local tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, the lesion area amounting to between 24.1% and 27.6% of the hemisphere at the level of the caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area of elevated brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> clearly exceeded the acidic core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and included the slightly alkaline border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that after 7-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient in nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion images reflects precisely the region of histological injury, breakdown of energy metabolism, and tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
