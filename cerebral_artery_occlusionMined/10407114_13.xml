<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to elucidate whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptors are induced after ischemic brain injury, possible expression of immunoreactive GDNF receptor-alpha1 (GFRalpha-1) and c-ret (RET) was examined at 3, 8, or 24 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed that both GFRalpha-1 and RET staining cells which were not detected in sham control brain, were present in the ipsilateral cortex and caudate at 3 to 8 h after permanent MCAO, and then decreased but remained to some extent at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive cells for both GDNF receptors were predominantly in cortical neurons of ischemic penumbral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of those receptors after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This rapid induction of GFRalpha-1 and RET, which correlates with the similar induction of GDNF under these conditions, may play a role in the early response to ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
