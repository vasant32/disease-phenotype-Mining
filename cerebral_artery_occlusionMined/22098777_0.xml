<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been well confirmed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has therapeutic effects following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to be maintained at a sufficient concentration of BDNF in the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown in our previous work that BDNF fused with a collagen-binding domain (CBD-BDNF) could specifically bind to collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ventricular ependyma of the brain is rich in collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have speculated that in the infarcted hemisphere, CBD-BDNF will bind to the collagen of the ventricular ependyma and stimulate the cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO), we injected CBD-BDNF into the lateral ventricle of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that CBD-BDNF was retained at high levels in the infarcted hemisphere, promoted neural regeneration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, reduced cell loss, <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp>, and improved functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, brain perfusion and metabolism, as evaluated by SPECT and PET, were improved in the CBD-BDNF treated group </plain></SENT>
