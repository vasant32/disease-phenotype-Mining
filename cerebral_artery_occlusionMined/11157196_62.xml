<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the neuroprotective efficacy of moderate-dose human albumin therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and defined the therapeutic window after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, within which this therapy would confer neurobehavioral and histopathological neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and received 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by a poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated during occlusion (60 minutes) and daily for 3 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the dose-response study, human albumin doses of either of 0.63 or 1.25 g/kg or saline vehicle (5 mL/kg) were given intravenously immediately after suture removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the therapeutic window study, a human albumin dose of 1.25 g/kg was administered intravenously at 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, or 5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after MCAo, brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate-dose albumin therapy significantly improved the neurological score at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours and significantly reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by 67% and 58%, respectively, at the 1.25- and 0.63-g/kg doses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were also significantly reduced by both doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain swelling</z:e> was virtually eliminated by albumin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even when albumin therapy (1.25 g/kg) was initiated as late as 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo, it improved the neurological score and markedly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in cortex (by 68%), subcortical regions (by 52%), and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (by 61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-dose albumin therapy markedly improves neurological function and reduces infarction volume and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, even when treatment is delayed up to 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
