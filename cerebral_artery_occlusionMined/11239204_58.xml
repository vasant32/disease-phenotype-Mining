<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preischemic steroid treatment protects animals of both sexes from focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> acts as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> when administered on reperfusion and whether the resulting increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) provides tissue protection from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were treated with reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 hours), then infused with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8389">Premarin</z:chebi>; 1 mg/kg) or vehicle during the first minutes of reperfusion (n=15 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to assess adequacy of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was determined at 22 hours after occlusion by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical and striatal CBF was measured by (14)[C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 10 (n=10) or 90 (n=11) minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, supraphysiological plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels were achieved during reperfusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 198+/-45 pg/mL; vehicle, 6+/-5; P:=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables were controlled and not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total hemispheric infarction was reduced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated rats (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 49+/-4% of ipsilateral structure; vehicle, 33+/-5%; P:=0.02), which was most pronounced in striatum (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 40+/-6% of ipsilateral striatum; vehicle, 60+/-3%; P:=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF recovery was strikingly increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> infusion at 10 minutes in frontal (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 102+/-12 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 45+/-15; P:=0.01) and parietal cortex (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 74+/-15 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 22+/-13; P:=0.028) and throughout striatum (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 87+/-13 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 25+/-20; P:=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric volume with low CBF recovery (eg, &lt;20 mL/100 g per minute) was smaller in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated animals (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 73+/-18 mm(3); vehicle, 257+/-46; P:=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, differences in CBF recovery could not be appreciated between groups by 90 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy during reperfusion improves tissue outcome from experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The steroid rapidly promotes CBF recovery and reduces hemispheric no-reflow zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This beneficial effect appears only during early reperfusion and likely complements other known mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> salvages brain from focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
