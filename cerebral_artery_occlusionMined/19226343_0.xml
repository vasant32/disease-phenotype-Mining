<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Assess the safety and efficacy of the continuous transcranial duplex Doppler (TCDD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (M1-2) occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) patients and compare TCDD to intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard IVT was performed within 3 hours since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 20 patients; between 3 and 6 hours continual 60 minute TCDD monitoring of occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using 2-MHz probe was performed in 10 patients and IAT in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and clinical outcome using modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH), clinical outcomes, and recanalization rates were compared among TCDD, IVT, and IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi(2) tests were used for statistical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of sICH was 0% in TCDD group, 5% in IVT, and 20% in IAT (P= .198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good 90-day clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 70% of TCDD patients (P= .570); recanalization after TCDD was found in 60% of patients (IVT 45%, IAT 70%) (P= .185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continual TCDD monitoring might be safe and potentially beneficial in treatment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
