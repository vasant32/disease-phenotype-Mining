<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated whether angiotensinogen (AGN) knockout mice exhibit differences in brain susceptibility to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and whether such differences can be related to special features of the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and AGN-knockout mice were submitted to permanent suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The collateral vascular system was visualized by systemic latex infusion, and the ischemic lesions were identified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl-violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The core and penumbra of the evolving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were differentiated by bioluminescence and autoradiographic imaging of ATP and protein biosynthesis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, mean arterial blood pressure was 95.0 +/- 8.6 mm Hg, and the diameter of fully relaxed anastomotic vessels between the peripheral branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries 26.6 +/- 4.0 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AGN knockouts, mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower, 71.5 +/- 8.5 mm Hg (P &lt; .01), and the anastomotic vessels were significantly larger, 29.4 +/- 4.6 microm (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, AGN-knockout mice exhibited a smaller ischemic core (defined as the region of ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>) but a larger penumbra (the area of disturbed protein synthesis with preserved ATP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, this difference disappeared, and histologically visible lesions were of similar size in both strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observations show that in AGN-knockout mice the more efficient collateral blood supply delays ischemic injury despite the lower blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic suppression of angiotensin formation may prolong the therapeutic window for treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
