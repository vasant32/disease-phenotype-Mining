<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to observe the effects of early intraarterial infusion of low-dose VEGF on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the rats were infused with 0.3 microg/kg of VEGF (n = 15), or the vehicle as a control (n = 15), via the reperfused internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains were collected after a 1 h, 6 h, or 72 h reperfused period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of ischemic cellular injury, serum extravasation, hemorrhagic transformation, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expressions were compared between the VEGF-treated and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the extent of ischemic cellular injury and serum extravasation was observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, vessel numbers with hemorrhagic transformation were significantly greater in the VEGF-treated group than in the control group after the 72 h reperfusion (9.4 +/- 1.6 versus 2.6 +/- 1.5; P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of hemorrhagic transformation was not correlated with the extent of ischemic cellular injury or serum extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and -9 expressions were not enhanced in the VEGF-treated group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that exogenous VEGF administered intravascularly at a very early point in reperfusion aggravates hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aggravated hemorrhagic transformation does not seem to depend on the enlargement of ischemic cellular injury, serum extravasation, or overexpressions of MMP-2 and -9 </plain></SENT>
