<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases are extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes involved in the shedding of DRs and DILs from the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), which is bound to the extracellular matrix, has been shown to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines by inhibiting cell surface sheddases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is an important mechanism of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the authors hypothesized that TIMP-3 would be expressed in ischemic neurons that are undergoing programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats had a 90-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcription of TIMP-3 mRNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots were used to measure TIMP-3 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spatial distribution and production of TIMP-3 was studied by immunohistochemistry at 3, 24, and 48 hours, 5 days, and 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation in cells dying by <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was identified with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16450">2'-deoxyuridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of reperfusion, TIMP-3 mRNA increased significantly in both ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed the identity of the TIMP-3, which appeared to be increased on the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 3 hours of reperfusion, TIMP-3 immunostaining was increased in neurons on the ischemic side, and by 24 hours the majority of the ischemic neurons were TIMP-3-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dual-fluorescence staining for TUNEL and TIMP-3 showed that they were coexpressed in many neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that ischemic neurons express TIMP-3, which may be inhibiting sheddases </plain></SENT>
