<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human serum albumin has neuroprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether albumin can attenuate the deleterious effects of tPA is yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, we attempted to determine the effects of albumin on cerebral injury and blood-brain barrier disruption induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours followed by 24 hours of reperfusion and tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats which received saline and tPA was 35.6 +/- 3.8% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and 50.9 +/- 4.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference between the two groups (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats that received tPA with albumin was significantly decreased to 29.2 +/- 3.3% (p&lt;0.05), compared with tPA-only-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy using tPA with albumin also improved neurological deficits and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> significantly (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to tPA-treated group, rats that received combination therapy using tPA with albumin had significantly reduced blood-brain barrier permeability, evaluated by quantitation of Evans blue leakage (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, combination therapy using tPA with albumin can attenuate the deleterious effects of tPA </plain></SENT>
