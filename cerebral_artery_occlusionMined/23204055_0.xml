<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that GW3965 treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases vascular remodeling, promotes synaptic protein expression and axonal growth in the ischemic brain, and improves functional outcome in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated without or with different doses of GW3965 (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) starting 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional tests, blood <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> measurement, and immunostaining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse brain endothelial cells, primary cultured artery explants, and primary cortical neurons cultures were also used in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GW3965 treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly increased blood <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> level, synaptic protein expression, axonal density, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and arteriogenesis, and Angiopoietin1, Tie2, and occludin expression in the ischemic brain and improved functional outcome compared with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> control animals (n=10; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, GW3965 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> also significantly increased capillary-like tube formation and artery explant cell migration as well as neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 attenuated GW3965-induced tube-formation, artery cell migration, and neurite outgrowth (n=6 per group; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate, for the first time, that GW3965 promotes synaptic protein expression and axonal growth and increases vascular remodeling, which may contribute to improvement of functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing Angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signaling activity may play an important role in GW3965-induced brain plasticity and neurological recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
