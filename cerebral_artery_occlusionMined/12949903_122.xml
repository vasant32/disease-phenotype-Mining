<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the induction of neurogenesis, reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and promotion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression as possible mechanisms by which treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) improves neurological functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, for the first time, we treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in female rats with intraveneous administration of MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female rats were subjected to 2 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), followed by an injection of 3 x 10(6) male (for Y chromosome labeling) rat MSCs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the tail vein 24 hr after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received daily injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 13 days after treatment for identification of newly synthesized DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (rotarod and adhesive-removal tests) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) were performed to identify transplanted MSCs (Y chromosome), BrdU, bFGF, and apoptotic cells in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery of behavior was found in MSC-treated rats at 7 days in the somatosensory test and at 14 days in the motor test after MCAo compared with control, PBS-treated animals (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MSCs were found to survive and preferentially localize to the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly more BrdU-positive cells were located in the subventricular zone (P&lt;.05), and significantly fewer apoptotic cells and more bFGF immunoreactive cell were found in the ischemic boundary area (P&lt;.05) of MSC-treated rats than in PBS-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that intravenously administered male MSCs increase bFGF expression, reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, promote endogenous cellular proliferation, and improve functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in female rats </plain></SENT>
