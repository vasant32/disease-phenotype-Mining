<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) monitoring in life, histological examinations of specimens of the brain was conducted on lesions produced 6h and 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after unilateral (left) permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCO) on five monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the typical images evident at primary ischemic foci around the middle cerebral artery, MRS revealed and enhanced, clearer region, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> extending into the reticular and compact area of the left substantia nigra one week after pMCO, inducing right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> caused by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar histological lesions were also induced in the left thalamus 4 weeks after pMCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a variety of histological findings including astrocytic activation, reduced number of nerve cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> were found in the above described areas far apart from the original ischemic cerebral foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our monkey model should be suitable for studies elucidating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as well as for investigating therapeutic strategies involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
