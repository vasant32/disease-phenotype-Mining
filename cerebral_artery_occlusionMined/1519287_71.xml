<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can quantitatively display focal brain abnormalities within minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed the present study to determine the effects of 1 and 2 hours of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (T2WI) during and after 1 and 2 hours of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats (n = 10 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of four animals from each group, we employed perfusion magnetic resonance imaging to monitor cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after survival for 24 hours were compared between the groups and correlated with DWI and T2WI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perfusion studies qualitatively documented hypoperfusion and reperfusion during and after temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion size on DWI during reperfusion was significantly less than that during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 1 (55% decline, p less than 0.02) but not 2 hours of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DWI signal intensity ratio (intensity compared with that in the contralateral homologous area) just before withdrawal of the occluder was significantly less in regions where the hyperintensity disappeared after withdrawal than in regions with persistent hyperintensity (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The T2WI studies revealed few or no abnormalities, except after 2 hours of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was significantly better in the 1-hour than in the 2-hour group (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postmortem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly smaller in the 1-hour group than in the 2-hour group (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postwithdrawal DWI accurately predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (R = 0.96, p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that DWI can rapidly display not only irreversible but also reversible ischemic brain damage and enhances the importance of DWI as a diagnostic modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
