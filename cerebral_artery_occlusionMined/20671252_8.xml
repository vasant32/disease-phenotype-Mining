<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were treated with rhEPO (5000 U/kg) in combination with tPA (10 mg/kg) at 2 or 6 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control groups consisted of ischemic rats treated with rhEPO (5000 U/kg) alone, tPA (10 mg/kg) alone, or saline at 2 or 6 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination therapy of rhEPO and tPA initiated 6 hours after MCAO did not reduce the ischemic lesion volume and significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the incidence of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> measured by frequency of gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and a quantitative spectrophotometric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> assay compared with rats treated with rhEPO alone and tPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when the combination therapy was initiated 2 hours after MCAO, the treatment significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the lesion volume and did not substantially increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining analysis revealed that the combination therapy of rhEPO and tPA at 6 hours significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased matrix metalloproteinase-9, NF-kappaB, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 immunoreactive cerebral vessels compared with rats treated with rhEPO alone and saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EPO exacerbates tPA-induced brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> without reduction of ischemic brain damage when administered 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model of embolic MCAO and that matrix metalloproteinase-9, NF-kappaB, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 upregulated by the delayed combination therapy may contribute to augmentation of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
