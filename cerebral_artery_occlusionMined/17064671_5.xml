<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with EGIS-8332 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 60 or 120 min after permanent MCAO, decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 30% and 36%, respectively, and the effect of GYKI 53405 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was similar (30% and 33%, respectively; p&lt;0.01 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither compound was effective if administered 180 or 240 min after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both EGIS-8332 and GYKI 53405 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the core and total (core plus penumbra) volumes of tissue injury in the whole brain and the cerebral cortex when administered 120 or 180 min after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The compounds did not alter tissue damage in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No neuroprotective effect was obtained at 240 min after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the therapeutic time window of neuroprotection by EGIS-8332 and GYKI 53405 was 2 h in permanent and 3 h in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that treatment with non-competitive AMPA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> can only be expected to produce a neuroprotective action in humans if administered shortly after the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
