<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dendritic spine plasticity may also contribute to functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but in that setting its expression may be complicated by alterations in local tissue perfusion, especially around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using adult Thy-1 GFP-M mice, we simultaneously recorded long-term spine dynamics in apical dendrites from layer 5 pyramidal cells and blood flow from surrounding capillaries with in vivo two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex before and after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex decreased significantly immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and improved gradually over time, in a distance-dependent manner from the epicenter of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, local tissue perfusion was never fully restored even after a 3 month recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, surviving layer 5 pyramidal neurons experienced a âˆ¼20% decrease in spine density acutely after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but eventually recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of this improvement were different depending on the degree of tissue perfusion acutely after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells in ischemic areas closer to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spine density levels slowly by retaining spines, while cells in more remote regions with preserved blood flow recovered faster by adding more spines, eventually surpassing baseline spine density by 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that maintaining tissue perfusion in the area surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> could hasten or augment synaptic plasticity and functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
