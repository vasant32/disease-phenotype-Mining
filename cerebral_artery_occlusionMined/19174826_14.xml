<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether arteriole reactivity and its homeostatic role of conserving red blood cell (RBC) flux remains intact after a transient period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine this issue, we measured vasodynamics in pial arteriole networks that overlie the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra during transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> laser-scanning microscopy was used to obtain direct and repeated measurements of RBC velocity and lumen diameter of individual arterioles, from which the flux of RBCs was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that occlusion altered surface arteriole flow patterns in a manner that ensured undisrupted flow to penetrating arterioles throughout the imaging field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small-diameter arterioles (&lt;23 microm), which included 88% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> penetrating arterioles, exhibited robust vasodilation over a 90-min occlusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Critically, persistent vasodilation compensated for an incomplete recovery of RBC velocity during reperfusion to enable a complete restoration of postischemic RBC flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, histologic examination of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> suggested re-oxygenation through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical layers of the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that selective reactivity of small pial arterioles is preserved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra and acts to conserve RBC flux during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
