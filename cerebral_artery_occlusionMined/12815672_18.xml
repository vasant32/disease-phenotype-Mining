<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activity-induced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> contrast MRI has been reported as a new visualization method for neural activation using <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> ions as a depolarization-dependent contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well known that energy failure induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produces anoxic depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to detect <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> accumulation caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of rat brain and to compare regional differences between <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> accumulation and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratios of signal intensity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI in the ipsilateral cortex to that in the contralateral cortex were 171.0 +/- 17.5% in MCAO group and 108.4 +/- 13.2% in the sham group </plain></SENT>
