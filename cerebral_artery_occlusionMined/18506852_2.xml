<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the global gene expression patterns in the penumbra, because the ischemic lesion in this region could be rescued by restoration of blood flow and other protective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) was used for tissue dissection at 4 and 24 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression in the penumbra was examined by using microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous reports, most genes were down-regulated at 4 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion in the ischemic penumbra compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, at 24 hr after reperfusion, most genes were up-regulated in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several genes not previously reported to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gene lists generated in this study will help us to understand better the spatial and temporal distribution of molecules involved in the ischemic cascade </plain></SENT>
