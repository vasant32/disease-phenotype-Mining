<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen adult cats were allocated to control (n = 7) and CP101,606-treated groups (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transorbital middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed under anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular fluid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> by microdialysis as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measurement by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-stained section, with and without neuroprotective agents, was used to determine the value of these potential "surrogate markers" of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The control group showed an increased dialysate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (15.5% increase) at 30 minutes and a peak (332.0% increase) in dialysate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> at 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with the drug-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between control and drug-treated groups were seen in the rate of fall of the apparent diffusion coefficient at both 1 and 5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was seen between the 1- and 5-hour apparent diffusion coefficient maps and the TTC-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly smaller lesion in the CP101,606-treated group (62.9% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared with the control group; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CP101,606 ranks very highly among the current neuroprotection candidates for clinical trials, and its excellent safety record in both animals and phase II studies in conscious, moderate head injury patients suggests that it will be highly effective in human occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
