<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) are rich in stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested whether intravenously infused HUCBC enter brain, survive, differentiate, and improve neurological functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested whether ischemic brain tissue extract selectively induces chemotaxis of HUCBC in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient (2-hour) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental groups were as follows: group 1, MCAO alone (n=5); group 2, 3x10(6) HUCBC injected into tail vein at 24 hours after MCAO (n=6) (animals of groups 1 and 2 were killed at 14 days after MCAO); group 3, MCAO alone (n=5); group 4, MCAO injected with PBS at 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=8); and group 5, 3x10(6) HUCBC injected into tail vein at 7 days after MCAO (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats of groups 3, 4, and 5 were killed at 35 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (rotarod and Modified Neurological Severity Score [mNSS]) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was used to identify cells derived from HUCBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotactic activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> brain tissue extracts toward HUCBC at different time points was evaluated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment at 24 hours after MCAO with HUCBC significantly improved functional recovery, as evidenced by the rotarod test and mNSS (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment at 7 days after MCAO with HUCBC significantly improved function only on the mNSS (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some HUCBC were reactive for the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein and the neuronal markers NeuN and microtubule-associated protein 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vitro, significant HUCBC migration activity was present at 24 hours after MCAO (P&lt;0.01) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenously administered HUCBC enter brain, survive, migrate, and improve functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HUCBC transplantation may provide a cell source to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
