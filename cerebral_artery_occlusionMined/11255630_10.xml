<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (2 hours) was induced in 32 male Wistar rats by extracranial insertion of a 3-0 nylon thread through the internal carotid artery into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at 0, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 6, 6, 8, 6, and 6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were fixed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="49826">periodate</z:chebi>-lysine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>, frozen, and sectioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with polyclonal antibody against nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each section was evaluated by microscopic observation (x100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of nNOS-positive neurons was 41.6 +/- 5.8 (mean +/- SD) in the control hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>nNOS was upregulated in the ischemic hemisphere (88.3 +/- 18.9), especially in the border zone at 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the number decreased to 36.4 +/- 3.6 and 26.3 +/- 7.3 in the ischemic hemisphere after 72 and 168 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>eNOS immunoreactivity was present in the endothelium of major vessels at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>eNOS was not detected in the microvessels before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but faint staining was found in the endothelium at 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining became more intense thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Faint iNOS immunoreactivity was seen in the microvessels at 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Macrophages in the ischemic core and astrocytes in the border zone showed immunoreactivity to iNOS at 72 and 168 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three types of NOS must be related to different stages of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>nNOS may be neurotoxic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the early phase, like iNOS in the late phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, eNOS seemed to be neuroprotective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
