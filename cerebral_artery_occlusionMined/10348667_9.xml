<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our working hypothesis is that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> results in a prompt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of high energy phosphate species resulting in decreased pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels in brain in a temporal and spatial pattern that disrupts nerve growth factor homeostasis and increases neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of active phosphate species after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, we observed that the striatum is an early target for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> that is followed by energy metabolic impairment and altered neurotrophin levels that were detected by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cytotoxicity and conventional biochemical determinations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels in a pattern distinct from that observed in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, early assessment of intracellular pH by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-MRS) was a predictor of later <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development as determined by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that pretreatment with pharmacological doses of NGF did not have overall significant beneficial consequences on irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in an intraluminal unilateral irreversible model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rat brain </plain></SENT>
