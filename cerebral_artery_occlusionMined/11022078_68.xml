<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> protect from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by upregulation of endothelial type III nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), but the downstream mechanisms have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether antithrombotic effects contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protection by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 129/SV <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and eNOS knockout mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> for 14 days (0.5, 1, and 10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from aortas and platelets was measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet factor 4 (PF 4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) in the plasma were quantified by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume after 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/23-hour reperfusion was significantly reduced by 38% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-treated animals (10 mg/kg) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol levels were not affected by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in aortas and in thrombocytes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated mice compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, indices of platelet activation in vivo, ie, plasma levels of PF 4 and beta-TG, were dose-dependently downregulated in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-treatment did not influence PF 4 and beta-TG levels in eNOS knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> upregulates eNOS in thrombocytes, decreases platelet activation in vivo, and protects from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in normocholesterolemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> are mediated in part by eNOS upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may provide a novel prophylactic treatment strategy independent of serum cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
