<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-1-null mice were used to determine whether COX-1 influences cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded in COX-1 -/- and +/+ mice (n = 9/group), and lesion volume was determined in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52295">thionin</z:chebi>-stained sections 24 or 96 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in COX-1 -/- mice, both at 24 (35 +/- 17%; P &lt; 0.05) and 96 hours (41 +/- 16%; P &lt; 0.05) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enlargement was not due to increased susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity, because microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> or kainate in the parietal cortex produced comparable lesions in COX-1 +/+ and -/- mice ( P &gt; 0.05; n = 8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to the enlargement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in the ischemic territory (n = 6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the reduction in cerebral blood flow was comparable in the ischemic core ( P &gt; 0.05), at the periphery of the ischemic territory the reduction was greater in COX-1 -/- mice (-58 +/- 4%) than in COX-1 +/+ mice (-34 +/- 5%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that mice lacking COX-1 are more susceptible to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, an effect that can be attributed to a more severe cerebral blood flow reduction in vulnerable regions at the periphery of the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the vascular effects of COX-1 may contribute to maintain cerebral blood flow in the postischemic brain and, as such, play a protective role in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
