<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging demonstrated ischemic cerebral injury 2 h post-occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats, while T2-weighted imaging failed to show clear evidence of injury until 2-6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the severely affected group of eight cats as determined by SEP criteria, ischemic injury evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was detected extensively in not only the basal ganglia but also the frontoparietal cortex including part of the somatosensory center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the mildly affected group of nine other cats, ischemic injury was limited to the basal ganglia with or without some involvement of the lower temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantitative signal intensity ratios in the frontoparietal cortex were significantly greater in the severely affected group than in the mildly affected group, but showed no difference between them in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
