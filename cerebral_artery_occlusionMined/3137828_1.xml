<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphometric parameters were determined through comparisons of the perfused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled vessels with alkaline phosphatase-stained preparations of the total microvascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF was significantly different when the contralateral cortex (54 +/- 7 ml.min-1.100 g-1) (means +/- SE) and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded cortex (31 +/- 8 ml.min-1.100 g-1) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant regional differences in any morphometric index of structure in the total microvascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the total capillary and arteriolar volume that was perfused in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-ligated cortex was significantly lower than the value obtained from the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in the perfusion pattern of the cerebral microvasculature in the ischemic cortex was not due to vessel blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The altered temporal perfusion pattern of capillary and arteriolar vessels in the occluded cortex may be due to an altered microvascular perfusion cycle, longer perfusion pathways, vasoconstriction, or partial vessel obstruction </plain></SENT>
