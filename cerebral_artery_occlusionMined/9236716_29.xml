<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The site or sites of action of IL-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology, however, are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the site(s) of action of IL-1/IL-1ra in ischemic brain damage by studying the effects of local injection of IL-1ra into the cortex or striatum following permanent MCAO in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical injection of IL-1ra (5 micrograms) did not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the cortex or striatum measured 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, striatal injection of IL-1ra ipsilateral to the infarction caused a significant and highly reproducible reduction of cortical (37%, p &lt; 0.001) and striatal damage (27%, p &lt; 0.001, corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>) compared with vehicle-injected animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injection of IL-1ra (5 micrograms) into the striatum, contralateral to the infarction, resulted in a small (9%) but significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction of ipsilateral cortical damage, with no effect on ipsilateral striatal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injection of a higher dose of IL-1ra (7.5 micrograms) in the contralateral striatum caused a further inhibition of ipsilateral cortical damage (24%, p &lt; 0.001) and a significant reduction of ipsilateral striatal damage (16%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of rats, it was established that core temperature (measured continuously in free-moving animals with remote radiotelemetry) was not affected by striatal or cortical injection of IL-1ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that injection of IL-1ra into the striatum but not the cortex reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in both the striatum and the cortex, independently of effects on core temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results imply that blocking striatal IL-1 contributes to IL-1ra-protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that IL-1 may influence striatal distal cortical damage through either the release of specific substances or activation of polysynaptic pathways </plain></SENT>
