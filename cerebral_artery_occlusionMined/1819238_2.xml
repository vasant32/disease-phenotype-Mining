<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each drug was administered immediately after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and neurologic grade was evaluated 1 to 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours post-occlusion, size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was compared with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was studied at 6 hours and 12 hours post-occlusion by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Nilvadipine-treated group, neurologic deficits improved more rapidly and the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly smaller than in the Nicardipine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a progressive extension of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the untreated rat, whereas the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size remained unchanged in the Nilvadipine-treated rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the potential therapeutic usefulness of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
