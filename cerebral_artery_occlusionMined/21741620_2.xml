<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to clarify the beneficial effects of MP-124, a novel PARP-1 inhibitor, on neurological deficits and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of MP-124 on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and neurological deficits in monkeys were investigated in permanent MCAO (pMCAO) and transient MCAO (tMCAO) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a dose-dependency study, the neurological deficits and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed at 28h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MP-124 significantly reduced the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, including that in the cortex/white matter and striatum, at doses of 0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg/h by 22, 54 and 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, MP-124 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses significantly reduced the overall neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such ameliorative effects of MP-124 were observed in female as well as male monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the therapeutic time window (TTW) study, the neurological deficits and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed at several time points after pMCAO or tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MP-124 at 3 and 6h after MCAO significantly ameliorated not only the neurological deficits but also the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MP-124 is thought to exhibit neuroprotective effects with a broad TTW regardless of sex in MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such findings suggest that MP-124 may be beneficial for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
