<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine (30 micrograms/kg) administered immediately after 3 hr of transient unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion attenuated significantly the post-ischemic increase of tissue water content and partly attenuated 45Ca accumulation in the parieto-temporal cortex ipsilateral to the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion 3 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine decreased the mortality rate at 6 and 9 hr after recirculation, although the survival rate at 24 hr after recirculation was not different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nimodipine has beneficial effects in the early phase of the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
