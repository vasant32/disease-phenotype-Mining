<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present set of studies was to develop a new primate model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion for long-term functional assessment in the common marmoset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, the cerebral vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the marmoset was interrogated by Araldite-cast and ink-perfusion methods to determine the feasibility of an intravascular surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods showed that the internal carotid artery was highly tortuous in its passage, precluding the development of an extracranial method of inducing temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the marmoset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pilot dose-response study investigated an intracranial approach of topically applying endothelin-1 (ET-1) to the M2 portion of the middle cerebral artery in a small sample of marmosets for up to 6 hours (n = 2 or 3 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent reductions in middle cerebral artery vessel caliber followed by gradual reperfusion were inversely related to increases in corrected lesion volume after ET-1 treatment, relative to vehicle control application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the functional consequences of ET-1-induced lesions to the M2 vascular territory were assessed up to 24 hours after surgery using the optimal dose established in the pilot study (2.5 nmol/25 microL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1-treated marmosets (n = 4) showed marked contralateral motor deficits in grip strength and retrieval of food rewards and contralateral sensory/motor neglect towards tactile stimulation, relative to their ipsilateral side and vehicle-treated marmosets (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong correlations were shown between contralateral impairments and histopathologic parameters, which revealed unilateral putamen and cortical damage to the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No deficits were shown on general mobility, and self-care was promptly resumed in ET-1 marmosets after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that this novel model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion in the marmoset has the potential to assess long-term function and to gauge the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies targeted for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
