<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While human observational studies and animal studies report a neuroprotective role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the multicenter placebo-controlled Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study concluded that hormone therapy increased the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study therefore tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement would increase the severity of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like injury in females when this replacement occurs after a prolonged hypoestrogenic period, such as the menopause or reproductive senescence, but not when given to females that were normally cycling immediately prior to the hormone replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of female rats were used: multiparous females with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but lengthened estrus cycles (mature adults), and older multiparous females currently in a persistent acyclic state (reproductive senescent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were either used intact, or were bilaterally ovariectomized and immediately replaced with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> pellet or control pellet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were subject to a forelimb placing test (a test for sensorimotor deficit) and thereafter to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by stereotaxic injection of the vasoconstrictive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1, adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, behavioral tests were performed again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, measured from brain slices, was significantly greater in intact reproductive senescent females as compared to intact mature adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment to ovariectomized mature adult females significantly reduced the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment to ovariectomized reproductive senescent females significantly increased cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as compared to control pellet replaced senescent females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> behavioral deficit was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups on the side contralateral to the lesion, while senescent females also exhibited deficits on the ipsilateral side, in the cross-midline forelimb placement test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using an animal model that approximates the natural ovarian aging process, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy in protecting brain health may depend critically on the time of initiation with respect to a female's reproductive status </plain></SENT>
