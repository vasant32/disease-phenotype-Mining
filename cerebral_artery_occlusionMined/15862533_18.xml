<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study focused on the role of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> during recovery from neurological deficits in a rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Castrate male rats were subjected to behavioral tests after 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 7 post-MCAO, neurological deficit-matched rats were assigned to a treatment group implanted with subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> pellets or a control group implanted with sham cholesterol pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks post-MCAO, the average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in the <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> group demonstrated significantly earlier improvement in neurological deficits and shortened latency of adhesive tape removal compared with the control group as analyzed by Wilcoxon signed ranks test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Walking on parallel bars improved in both groups with a trend towards early recovery observed in the <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biased left body swings persisted during the test period in both groups post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was within physiological levels in the treatment group but was not detectable in the control group by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GAP-43 and synaptophysin expression did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less GFAP expression and reactive astrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> were found around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>-treated rats compared with control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> replacement post-MCAO accelerated functional recovery in castrate rats, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> replacement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
