<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated cerebral immunohistologic and plasma changes in NSE in rats from 2 h to 15 days following permanent or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1-2 days post-MCAO, loss of NSE immunofluorescence from within neurons to the extracellular space was observed in the infarcted areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NSE also was identified intravascularly throughout the brain following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NSE in plasma was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma NSE following permanent or transient MCAO was increased significantly from that observed in controls (2.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) beginning at 2 h and persisting for 2.5 days post-MCAO (maximum levels of 8.8 +/- 0.9 to 9.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml after 6-12 h; P &lt; 0.05, n = 4-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantified contralateral forelimb and hindlimb neurological deficits in these animals were significant and persisted for at least 15 days following MCAO but were not observed following sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that MCAO-induced cortical infarction and neurological dysfunction is associated with neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and vascular redistribution of brain NSE resulting in a measurable increase in plasma NSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such diffusion of NSE into the cerebral vasculature and systemic circulation from ischemic tissue can be expected to serve as a marker for the incidence of cerebral damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
