<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A direct-current electrocorticogram (two channels) and a direct-current magnetoencephalogram (seven channels) were simultaneously recorded from five rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1-2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Direct-current electrocorticographic and direct-current magnetoencephalographic signal deflections were observed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and occurred repeatedly throughout the ischemic period, with a mean +/- SD time interval of 12 +/- 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A one-to-one correspondence of the electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic signal deflections was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct-current magnetoencephalography can provide a new noninvasive technique for studying depolarization and/or spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
