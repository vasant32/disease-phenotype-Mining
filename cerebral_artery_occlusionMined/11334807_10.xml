<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell line-conditioned medium was analyzed using ELISA and two cell lines were identified which produce GDNF in physiologically active concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ELISA analyses revealed that conditioned medium from these two cell lines also contained PDGF, bFGF, TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both of these cell lines were then transplanted into the striatal penumbra of rats, 1 h following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing revealed that both cell lines reduced the deficit associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was likely achieved by the action of GDNF and/or other growth factors produced by the cells </plain></SENT>
