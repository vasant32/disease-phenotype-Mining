<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan and reduces levels of cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in several different organ systems including the brain, the impact of DR on ischemic brain injury is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that maintenance of adult rats on a DR regimen resulted in reduced brain damage and improved behavioral outcome in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-reperfusion (MCAO-R) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (2-DG), a nonmetabolizable analogue of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, to rats fed ad libitum resulted in reduced ischemic brain damage and improved behavioral outcome following MCAO-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2-DG protected cultured hippocampal neurons against chemical <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, demonstrating a direct protective action on neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DR and 2-DG administration resulted in an increase in the level of the stress protein heat-shock protein 70 (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70) in striatal cells in vivo, and 2-DG treatment induced <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 in cultured neurons suggesting involvement of a preconditioning stress response in the neuroprotective actions of DR and 2-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of DR and 2-DG in this focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model suggests that outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be improved in individuals who follow a regimen of reduced food intake </plain></SENT>
