<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From this group we selected 36 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these 36 patients, we compared the presence of a collateral blood supply during the early phase with the extent of final parenchymal brain damage obtained by computed tomography 3 months after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of a collateral circulation during the first few hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduced the size of the final parenchymal brain damage in patients with middle cerebral artery stem-trunk occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collateral blood supply was more efficient in patients who had no significant stenosing lesions of the extracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that the lenticulostriate arteries are end arteries not supplied by collateral blood vessels and suggest that lesions formerly thought to be caused by hemodynamic mechanisms (watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) or arteriolar lesions (lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) may be due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
