<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown cardiovascular and autonomic disturbances in male Wistar rats following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this model, neurochemical changes, that were maximal at 3-5 days and subsiding by day 10, were observed unilaterally in the insular cortex and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amygdalar neurochemical changes may be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced cardiovascular disturbances, since the amygdala is critical in mediating the cardiovascular responses to stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the cardiovascular responses to intermittent and continuous noise and air-jet stimulation in male Wistar rats on days 2-10 after right-sided MCAO or sham MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to the sham MCAO rats, intermittent noise elicited significant tachycardiac responses on days 5 and 7 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Air-jet stimulation also elicited a significant tachycardic response on day 5, whereas continuous noise produced significant tachycardiac and pressor responses at days 5 and 7, respectively, in the MCAO rats compared to the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses on the heart rate variability using fast Fourier transformation revealed significant increases in the normalized mid-frequency spectral power on day 7 for intermittent noise and air-jet stimulation, suggesting increases in the sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a time-course of exaggerated cardiovascular responses to stress and suggest a state of susceptibility to cardiac perturbations in rats following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
