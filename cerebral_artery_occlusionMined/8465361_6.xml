<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> localized in the anterior cerebral artery territory is rather uncommon, and its etiology has not yet been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on computed tomographic findings, 17 patients with solitary anterior cerebral artery territory infarction were selected from among 3,619 patients admitted consecutively to our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients without angiographic examinations were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings and clinical category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were analyzed in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic abnormalities were revealed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These consisted of occlusive changes (n = 10) or reversible segmental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (n = 3) of the anterior cerebral artery, A1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (n = 5), and occlusive changes of the carotid artery (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with anterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the occluded artery was reopened and subsequently became reoccluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was classified as atherothrombotic in 10 patients, cardioembolic in three, and undetermined in the remaining four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In eight of the 10 patients with atherothrombotic infarction, the anterior cerebral artery was narrowed or occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with cardioembolic infarction, the A1 segment contralateral to the infarction was hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series, solitary anterior cerebral artery territory infarction was attributable most commonly to local atherothrombosis and occasionally to cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A hypoplastic A1 segment may facilitate the occurrence of embolism in the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reversible dilatatory and occlusive changes of this artery may be another important cause of infarction </plain></SENT>
