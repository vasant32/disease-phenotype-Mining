<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Brief systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> protects the rodent brain from subsequent ischemic injury, although the protection wanes within days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the duration of ischemic tolerance could be extended from days to months by repeated intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> of varying magnitude and duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Infarction volumes following a 60-minute transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were determined in adult male mice 2 days through 8 weeks after completion of a 2-week repetitive hypoxic preconditioning (RHP) protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Separate cohorts were studied for the protective effects of RHP on postischemic and cytokine-induced cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and for potential deleterious effects of the RHP stimulus itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RHP protection against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> persisted for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte adherence to cortical venules was attenuated in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as well as following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± administration, indicating that reductions in postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were not secondary to smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RHP reduced poststroke leukocyte diapedesis concomitant with a long-lasting downregulation of endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, and also reduced postischemic blood--brain barrier permeability to endogenous immunoglobulin G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RHP was without effect on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell viability, only transiently elevated hematocrit, and did not affect the magnitude of cerebral blood flow during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Taken together, our findings reveal a novel form of epigenetic neurovascular plasticity characterized by a prominent anti-inflammatory phenotype that provides protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> many weeks longer than previously established windows of preconditioning-induced tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Translating these endogenous protective mechanisms into therapeutics could afford sustained periods of cerebroprotection in subpopulations of individuals at identified risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
