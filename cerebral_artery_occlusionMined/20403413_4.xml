<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified the proteins that are expressed following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> administration during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were ovariectomized and treated with oil or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and brains were collected 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein analysis was performed on the cerebral cortex using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein spots with difference in intensity between oil- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-treated groups were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these proteins, levels of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and astrocytic phosphoprotein PEA-15 were significantly decreased in the oil-treated group in comparison to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Western blot analysis demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment prevents injury-induced decrease of PP2A and PEA-15 levels during both MCAO-induced injury and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> exposure in HT22 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of the 60kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 60) were significantly increased in oil-treated animals, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced increase of Hsp 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study provide an evidence that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain injury through the up- and down-modulation of specific proteins </plain></SENT>
