<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that puerarin (Pur), extracted from the dried root of Pueraria lobata (Wild) Ohwi, increases cerebral blood flow in dogs and attenuates cerebral and spinal cord injury resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in rats and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study further demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of Pur on cerebral ischemic injury in rats and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) for 50 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pur (50, 100 mg/kg, i.p) was administered at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, neurological deficits were evaluated in Pur- and vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> ratios were assessed from stained brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that Pur (100 mg/kg) markedly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 34 % ( P &lt; 0.01) in cerebral cortex and improved the neurological functions ( P &lt; 0.05) after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of annexin-V and PI labeling cells showed that the percentages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the dorsolateral cortex were significantly reduced by 38.6 % and 28.5 % ( P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05) following treatment with Pur (100 mg/kg) in MCAo rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 activity, a biochemical marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, was significantly inhibited after treatment with Pur in the dorsolateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this result, the expression of the X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (XIAP) was obviously up-regulated after administration of Pur (100 mg/kg), while caspase-3 gene was down-regulated in the dorsolateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotection of puerarin against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
