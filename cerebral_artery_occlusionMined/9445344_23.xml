<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) of ischemic brain tissue may occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients either spontaneously or after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A method to assess the risk of HT in ischemic tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would improve the safety of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a means of predicting HT, we investigated the role of contrast-enhanced MRI at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> time points in a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was used to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in male Wistar rats (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was performed by withdrawal of the occluding filament after 2 (n=4), 3 (n=6), or 4 (n=1) hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI studies were performed before and after reperfusion with the use of conventional T1-weighted imaging, with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> (Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) contrast agent, and T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI and histological studies were obtained at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred by 24 hours in 9 of 11 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> throughout the ischemic region at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A hyperintense region in the preoptic area became visible after Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> injection within minutes after reperfusion in animals with subsequent HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> enhancement subsequently developed petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (or died) by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these animals, statistically significant differences in signal intensity (P=.0005) between the ipsilateral enhancing region and a homologous contralateral region were detected on post-Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant correlation (P=.01) between the rate of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> uptake and the size of the enhancing area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two animals did not enhance with Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> and did not exhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on histological examination or MRI at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were seen on precontrast T1-weighted images before and shortly after reperfusion or postcontrast T1-weighted images before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The primary finding of this study was the detection of early Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> parenchymal enhancement in 82% of the animals after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Enhancement was seen before any detectable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, suggesting that early endothelial ischemic damage occurs before gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> enhancement may provide an early prediction of petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
