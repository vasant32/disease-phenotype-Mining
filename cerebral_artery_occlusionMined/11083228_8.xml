<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the time course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> compared with microglial activation in adult rat brain slices after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To distinguish peripheral leukocytes from microglia, the blood cells were prelabeled in vivo with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">Rhodamine 6G</z:chebi> (Rhod6G) i.v. before induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At specific times after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, invading leukocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells were labeled in situ with isolectin (IL)B4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> (ILB4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six hours after MCAO only a few of the ILB4+ cells were colabeled by Rhod6G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells expressed the voltage-gated inwardly and outwardly rectifying K+ currents characteristic of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the ILB4+ cells were Rhod6G- and expressed a lack of voltage-gated channels, recently described for ramified microglial cells in brain slices, or exhibited only an inward rectifier current, a unique marker for cultured (but unstimulated) microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after MCAO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood-borne and the majority of Rhod6G- cells expressed outward and inward currents indicating that the intrinsic microglial population exhibited physiologic features of stimulated, cultured microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ILB4+/Rhod6G- intrinsic microglial population was more abundant in the border zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> changed from radial to ameboid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within this zone, the authors observed rapidly migrating cells and recorded this movement by time-lapse microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current findings indicate that microglial cells acquire physiologic features of leukocytes at a later time point after MCAO </plain></SENT>
