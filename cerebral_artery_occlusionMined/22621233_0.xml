<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims at evaluating the outcome of NBP given prior to and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in SHR and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For pre-treatment, NBP was administered to SHR and WKY daily for two months prior to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For post-treatment, NBP was given daily for seven consecutive days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days post-surgery, rats were tested for the presence of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining were employed to calculate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex and corpus striatum in the ischemic penumbra area were examined microscopically for pathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SHR, NBP pre- and post-treatment significantly lowered neurological deficit scores, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and minimized pathological changes in the penumbra area when compared to oil-vehicle treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In WKY, these beneficial effects were observed only in the post-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of NBP post-treatment were greater in WKY than in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that NBP could exert both preventive and therapeutic effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in SHR, but only exerted therapeutic effect in WKY </plain></SENT>
