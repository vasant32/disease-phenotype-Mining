<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We asked whether the structure and function of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> is disrupted differently in neonatal and adult rats by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In adult rats, albumin leakage into injured regions was markedly increased during 2-24 h reperfusion but leakage remained low in the neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional assays employing intravascular tracers in the neonates showed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability to both large (70 kDa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>) and small (3 kDa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> (III)-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid tracers remained largely undisturbed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The profoundly different functional integrity of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was associated with the largely nonoverlapping patterns of regulated genes in endothelial cells purified from injured and uninjured adult and neonatal brain at 24 h (endothelial transcriptome, 31,042 total probe sets) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within significantly regulated 1266 probe sets in injured adults and 361 probe sets in neonates, changes in the gene expression of the basal lamina components, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, the tight junction protein occludin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were among the key differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of collagen-IV, laminin, claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens protein 1 was also better preserved in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration remained low in acutely injured neonates but neutralization of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 in the systemic circulation enhanced neutrophil infiltration, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The markedly more integrant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in neonatal brain than in adult brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may have major implications for the treatment of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
