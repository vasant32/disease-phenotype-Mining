<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 21-aminosteroid <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation inhibitor, U74006F, on ischaemic brain tissue damage using the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under anaesthesia, the left middle cerebral artery was exposed without cutting the dura mater via a subtemporal craniotomy, under an operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photo-illumination (wave length; 540 nm) was applied to the middle cerebral artery and then <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was completely occluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> about 6 min after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>U74006F (1.0 mg/kg) was then injected intravenously just after the cessation of illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours after the operation, the extent of ischaemic damage was measured by magnetic resonance imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After measuring the extent of ischaemic damage, the brain was immediately removed from animals treated with or without U74006F for determination of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and the generation of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>U74006F significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced the size of ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the operation, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and the concentration of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> in the left hemisphere (infarction side) were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>U74006F significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased the content of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products and free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) correlation between the extent of ischaemic damage and the concentration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products in the left hemisphere 24 h after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, U74006F might reduce the extent of ischaemic damage by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in the brain, thus minimizing oxidative damage to neural tissues </plain></SENT>
