<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The changes being studied included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> effects, EMG burst duration in the gait cycle, and the symmetry of muscle activation between affected and unaffected sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intramuscular EMG of medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in male Sprague Dawley rats at affected side (n=10) and unaffected side (n=10) were recorded during the treadmill running before a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAo/r) surgery and poststroke recovery stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral test score and bodyweight were recorded at a daily basis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean power frequency (MPF) of the EMG, EMG burst duration in the gait cycle, and symmetry index between two sides were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The drop rate of MPF of MG at the unaffected side increased (P&lt;0.05) at poststroke day 2 and it generally decreased along the poststroke training days and almost returned to baseline value at poststroke day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symmetry index of MG and TA showed a large imbalance right after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and tended to return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings of the MPF drop after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might indicate <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> effects due to the compensation loading share of the ipsilateral side muscle and the increase of the symmetry index reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>abnormal gait</z:hpo> pattern after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recovery rate after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could be investigated with EMG parameters together with the behavioral score, and both were improved during and after the BWS treadmill training </plain></SENT>
