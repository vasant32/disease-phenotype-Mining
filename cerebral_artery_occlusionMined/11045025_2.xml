<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the experimental group (n = 27) middle cerebral artery was coagulated 3-4 mm length from the origin of the lateral striate arteries to the inferior cerebral vein and divided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control rats (n = 20) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the surgical procedures except occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another group of rats (n = 40) were used to determine the anatomical variations of middle cerebral artery after intracarotid carbon black injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five major patterns of middle cerebral artery were observed and two of them were major and constituted 92.5% of rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the third day after occlusion the brains were stained with 2%, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrozolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of infarction was assessed by computerized analysis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study after determining the variations of the middle cerebral artery and its branches in our strain of rats, we were able to achieve 92.5% grade III and IV infarcted area </plain></SENT>
