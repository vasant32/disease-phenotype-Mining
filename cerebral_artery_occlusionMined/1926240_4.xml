<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the blood flow tracer hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> is now widely used for cerebral blood flow mapping using single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, its uptake into acutely ischemic brain has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a double-label autoradiographic study in which 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> uptake was compared with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine-derived cerebral blood flow 0.5, 24, and 72 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 11 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We noted excellent correspondence between iodoantipyrine and hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> autoradiograms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times with both simultaneous tracer injection and 30-minute separation of tracer injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the ischemic and hyperemic areas were measured from the same brain section using the two different tracers, hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> underestimated the iodoantipyrine-derived areas by less than 1% (95% confidence interval -2.9% to 2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum discrepancy (-19%) was seen at high flows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the two tracers were injected separately, the uptake of hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> was not linear compared with iodoantipyrine-derived cerebral blood flow, but the relation became linear after the Lassen correction factor was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> uptake thus accurately represents cerebral blood flow 0.5-72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
