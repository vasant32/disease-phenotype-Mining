<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of early blood pressure (BP) changes on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion evolution and clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a documented middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with IV tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple repeated systolic (SBP) and diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) BP measurements were obtained during 24 hours after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography before and 36-48 hours after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed on transcranial Doppler at 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores were recorded at baseline and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale was used to assess 3-month outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization occurred in 44 (55%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BP variability, estimated as the SD of the mean, was associated with DWI lesion growth (r = 0.46, p = 0.0003 for SBP and r = 0.26, p = 0.02 for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), early clinical course (p = 0.06 for SBP and p = 0.01 for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), and 3-month outcome (p = 0.002 for SBP and 0.07 for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic significance of BP changes differed depending on the presence of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SBP variability emerged as an independent predictor of DWI lesion growth (beta: 6.9; 95% CI, 3.2 to 10.7, p = 0.003) and worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome (OR: 11; 95% CI: 2.2 to 56.1; p = 0.004) in patients without recanalization, but not in recanalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Blood pressure variability is associated with greater diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth and worse clinical course in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, its impact varies depending on the occurrence of early recanalization after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
