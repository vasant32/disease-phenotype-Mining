<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that intermittent and prolonged normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (HO) results in brain ischemic tolerance (<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>), reducing ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have attempted to determine the time course of HO-induced <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>, and to explore the putative roles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) converting enzyme (TACE), TNF-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in mediating this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two core experimental protocols were applied to rats (experiments 1 [E1] and 2 [E2] respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E1 rodents comprised six subgroups, breathing room air (RA; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>=21%), or 95% oxygen (HO) for 4, 8, 16 h (4RA, 8RA, 16RA and 4HO, 8HO, 16HO respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E2 rodents were divided into subgroups, exposed to 95% inspired HO for 4 h/day for six consecutive days (intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, InHO) or for 24 continuous hours (prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, PrHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of these had a control group exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after pretreatment, each group was randomly divided to receive 60 min right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO-operated), sham-operation (without MCAO), or no operation (intact) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24 h reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS), brain water content, Evans Blue extravasation (as a marker of blood-brain barrier permeability), TACE expression, serum TNF-alpha, and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi>- kappaBalpha levels were assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the MCAO-operated subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E1: Compared with the control (RA) group, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by 58.6% and 64.4% in 16 h and 24 h respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NDS and Evans Blue extravasation was also reduced in 16 h and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference among 4 h and 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>E2: Preconditioning with prolonged and intermittent HO decreased NDS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and upregulated TACE and increased <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi>-kappaBalpha and serum TNF-alpha level significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of brain ischemic tolerance, InHO and PrHO may partly exert their effects via triggering TACE/TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
