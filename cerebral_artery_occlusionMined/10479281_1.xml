<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of analogues of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi>-2-carboxylate GV150526, currently in clinical trials as a potential neuroprotective agent for the control of the cerebral damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, was designed based on previous studies dealing with the electronic features of the north-east region of the glycine binding site associated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the substitution of the para position of the terminal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> ring of GV150526 with suitable hydrophilic groups resulted in the identification of a new class of glycine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds exhibited nanomolar in vitro affinity to the glycine binding site, high receptor selectivity, and outstanding in vivo potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, 3-[(E)-2-[(4-ureidomethylphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004">aminocarbonyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37603">ethenyl</z:chebi>]-4, 6-dichloroindole-2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> was found to be highly effective in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) model in the rat, an animal model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, when given both prior to and after the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, a significant neuroprotective effect was seen in this model postischaemia, when the administration of this compound was delayed up to 6 h from the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, further confirming the wide therapeutic window seen for GV150526A </plain></SENT>
