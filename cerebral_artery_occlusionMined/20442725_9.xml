<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether epicatechin (EC), a flavanol in cocoa and tea, is protective against brain ischemic damage in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> mice pretreated orally with 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg EC before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) had significantly smaller brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and decreased neurologic deficit scores (NDS) than did the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice that were posttreated with 30 mg/kg of EC at 3.5 hours after MCAO also had significantly smaller brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and decreased NDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, WT mice pretreated with 30 mg/kg of EC and subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>)-induced excitotoxicity had significantly smaller lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability assays with neuronal cultures further confirmed that EC could protect neurons against oxidative insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the EC-associated neuroprotection was mostly abolished in mice lacking the enzyme <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO1) or the transcriptional factor Nrf2, and in neurons derived from these knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EC exerts part of its beneficial effect through activation of Nrf2 and an increase in the neuroprotective HO1 enzyme </plain></SENT>
