<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Employing diffusion (DWI)- and perfusion (PWI)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the effect of NBO (100% started at 30 mins after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)) on the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during and after permanent (pMCAO) and transient suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) was investigated (experiment 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two additional experiments, time window (experiment 1) and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways (experiment 2) were investigated in the pMCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, NBO treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 h after pMCAO by 10% when administered for 3 h (P&gt;0.05) and by 44% when administered for 6 h (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, NBO acutely (390 mins, P&lt;0.05) reduced in situ end labeling (ISEL) positivity in the ipsilesional penumbra but increased contralesional necrotic as well as caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment 3, CBF characteristics and CBF-derived lesion volumes did not differ between treated and untreated animals, whereas the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>)-derived lesion volume essentially stopped progressing during NBO treatment, resulting in a persistent PWI/DWI mismatch that could be salvaged by delayed (3 h) reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NBO (1) acutely preserved the perfusion/diffusion mismatch without altering CBF, (2) significantly extended the time window for reperfusion, (3) induced lasting neuroprotection in permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and (4) although capable of reducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in hypoperfused tissue it also induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in otherwise unaffected areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that NBO may represent a promising strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
