<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent advancements in molecular biology are made to expect the appearance of the new treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One is the administration of neurotrophic factors, and another is the use of neural stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we performed two experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First experiment is administration of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) using an adenovirus vector into ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A replication-defective adenoviral vector containing GDNF gene (Ad-GDNF) was directly injected into the cerebral cortex at 1 day before 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume of the Ad-GDNF injected group at 24 h after the transient MCAO was significantly smaller than that of vehicle or Ad-LacZ treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the successful exogenous GDNF gene transfer ameliorates the ischemic brain injury after transient MCAO in association with the reduction of apoptotic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second one is the neural stem cell activation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible expression of highly polysialylated neural cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (PSA-NCAM) in gerbil hippocampus after 5 min of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in association to the proliferation of neural stem cell labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of PSA-NCAM positive cells increased in dentate gyrus (DG) at 10 and 20 days, and that of BrdU-labeled cells increased in DG at 5 and 10 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence for PSA-NCAM and BrdU showed that a few cells per section were double labeled in DG only at 10 days after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest different chronological change of PSA-NCAM positive and BrdU-labeled cells in DG after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
