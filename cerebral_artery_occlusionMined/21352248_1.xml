<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the dose-related influence of alcohol consumption on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the potential mechanism that accounts for the disparate effects of high-dose and low-dose alcohol consumption on cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet with or without 1, 3, 5, or 6.4% (v/v) alcohol for 8 weeks and subjected to a 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the brain injury at 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we measured protein expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in parietal cortex and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, memantine, on 2-hour MCAO/24â€ƒh reperfusion-induced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with non-alcohol-fed rats, the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was not altered in 3 and 5% alcohol-fed rats but significantly reduced in 1% alcohol-fed rats and exacerbated in 6.4% alcohol-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor subunit, NR1, was upregulated in 6.4% alcohol-fed rats, whereas expression of EAAT2 was downregulated in 6.4% alcohol-fed rats and upregulated in 1% alcohol-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Memantine reduced 2-hour MCAO/24 h reperfusion-induced brain injury in non-alcohol-fed and 6.4% alcohol-fed rats, but not in 1% alcohol-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of reduction in the brain injury was greater in 6.4% alcohol-fed rats compared to non-alcohol-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> consumption of low-dose alcohol protects the brain against I/R injury, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> consumption of high-dose alcohol has detrimental effect on cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disparate effects of low-dose and high-dose alcohol consumption on cerebral I/R may be related to an alteration in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
