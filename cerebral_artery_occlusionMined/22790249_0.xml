<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, many recanalization devices are in clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compares the outcome parameters, efficacy, and safety of the new generation of stent-retriever devices with the well-established Merci retriever.MATERIALS AND METHODS:<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who received endovascular mechanical recanalization therapy were prospectively registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-two patients were treated with either new stent retrievers, including the Trevo and Solitaire devices, or the Merci retriever system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the occluded vessel was assessed in accordance with the modified TICI score, and outcome parameters, including the NIHSS and mRS scores, were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical status was recorded after neurointervention, at time of discharge, and after 90 days.RESULTS:The mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 68 years; 54% were male, with no statistical differences in demographics between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization (TICI 3 and TICI 2b) was achieved in 82% of patients treated with stent retrievers compared with 62% of patients treated with Merci retrievers (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 90-day follow-up, 65% of patients treated with stent retrievers and 35% of those treated with the Merci had achieved a good (mRS = 0-2) clinical outcome (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with stent retrievers had a significantly shorter treatment time (72 versus 122 minutes, P &lt; .01) and less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (10% versus 28%, P &lt; .01).CONCLUSIONS:Patients treated with Trevo and Solitaire stents had a better revascularization rate, better clinical outcome, and lower complication rate than patients treated with the Merci retriever </plain></SENT>
