<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study is to explore the novel use of support vector machine (SVM) to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on a pixel-by-pixel basis using only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) MRI data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of SVM prediction model was tested on three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups: 30-min, 60-min, and permanent middle cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=12 rats for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and relaxation time constant (T2) were acquired during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase up to 3h and again at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> was predicted using only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (30-min) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to quantify prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver-operating curves were 86±2.7%, 89±1.4%, and 93±0.8% using <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF data for the 30-min, 60-min and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adding neighboring pixel information and spatial infarction incidence improved performance to 88±2.8%, 94±0.8%, and 97±0.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SVM prediction compares favorably to a previously published artificial neural network (ANN) prediction algorithm operated on the same data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SVM prediction model has the potential to provide quantitative frameworks to aid clinical decision-making in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
