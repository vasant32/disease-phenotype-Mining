<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether compensation in the production of downstream effectors by one pathway when the other is disrupted can explain these findings, we examined cytokine/chemokine expression and inflammatory infiltrates in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT), MyD88(-/-) and TRIF-mutant mice following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytokine/chemokine expression was measured with a 25-plex bead array in the serum and brains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups of mice at baseline (no surgery/naïve) and at 3 hours and 24 hours following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain inflammatory and neutrophil infiltrates were examined 24 hours following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-6, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IL-10 were significantly decreased in MyD88(-/-) mice compared to WT mice following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly, decreased levels of the neutrophil chemoattractants KC and G-CSF corresponded with a trend toward fewer neutrophils in the brains of MyD88(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IP-10 was significantly decreased when either pathway was disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MIP-1 α was significantly decreased in TRIF-mutant mice, consistent with TRIF-dependent production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MyD88(-/-) mice showed elevations of a number of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-13, at baseline, which became significantly decreased following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both MyD88 and TRIF mediate pathway-specific cytokine production following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest a compensatory Th2-type skew at baseline in MyD88(-/-) mice and a paradoxical switch to a Th1 phenotype following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MyD88 pathway directs the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
