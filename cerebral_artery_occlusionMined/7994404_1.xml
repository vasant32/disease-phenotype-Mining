<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of hemodilution, with diaspirin cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (DCLHb), on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 36) were alloted to a control group in which hematocrit (Hct) was not manipulated, or reduced with DCLHb to 30% (30/DCLHb), 16% (16/DCLHb), or 9% (9/DCLHb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After MCAo, the brain area with a CBF of 0-10 ml.100g-1.min-1 was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This area was decreased in the 30/DCLHb and 16/DCLHb groups vs the Control group; and was less in the 9/DCLHb group vs the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different rats (n = 49) were hemodiluted with DCLHb or Albumin (Alb): Control, 30/Alb, 30/DCLHb, 16/DCLHb, or 9/DCLHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3-hr of MCAo and 2-hr of reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was less in the 30/DCLHb and 16/DCLHb groups vs the Control and 30/Alb groups; and was less in the 9/DCLHb group vs the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support the hypothesis that hemodilution with DCLHb decreases <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner, and in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is a more proficient hemodiluting fluid than albumin </plain></SENT>
