<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that intermittent and prolonged normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (HO) results in ischemic tolerance to reduce ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this research, we attempted to see changes in excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and TNF-alpha levels following prolonged and intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into four experimental groups, each of 21 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first two were exposed to 95% inspired HO for 4 h/day for 6 consecutive days (intermittent HO, InHO) or for 24 continuous hours (prolonged HO, PrHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second two groups acted as controls, and were exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each main group was subdivided to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO-operated), sham-operated (without MCAO), and intact (without any surgery) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 h from pretreatment, MCAO-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24 h reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured in MCAO-operated subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EAATs expression and serum TNF-alpha levels were assessed in sham-operated and intact subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with prolonged and intermittent HO decreased NDS and upregulated EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 and increased serum TNF-alpha levels significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance, the intermittent and prolonged HO seems to partly exert their effects via increase serum TNF-alpha levels and upregulation of EAATs </plain></SENT>
