<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, which used a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model, the protective effects of huperzine A (HupA) against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and brain damage were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO for 45 min followed by 4 hr of reperfusion significantly impaired the activities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain enzymes (complex I, complex II-III, and complex IV) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of HupA at 0.1 mg/kg significantly preserved respiratory chain enzyme activities, decreased ROS production, and attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It could also significantly attenuate the neurological deficits (after 4 or 24 hr reperfusion) and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (after 24 hr reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HupA protected isolated nonsynaptosomal mitochondria from calcium-induced damage in vitro by preserving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and decreasing ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the present study indicates that HupA can ameliorate MCAO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, and this might partially contribute to its protective effect on brain damage after 24 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
