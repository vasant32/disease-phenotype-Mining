<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in cultured primary astrocytes was induced by the oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations of astrocytes were evaluated with astroglia markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formation of autophagosomes in astrocytes was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of autophagy-related proteins were examined with immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of autophagy in OGD or focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of astrocytes was assessed by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> (3-MA) or bafilomycin A(1) (Baf) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that GFAP staining was reduced in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain areas 3-12 h following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or OGD induced activation of autophagy in astrocytes as evidenced by the increased formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52007">monodansylcadaverine</z:chebi> (MDC)-labeled vesicles; the increased production of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II ); the upregulation of Beclin 1, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and lysosomal cathepsin B expression; and the decreased levels of cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein in primary astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3-MA inhibited OGD-induced the increase in LC3-II and the decline in Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 3-MA and Baf slightly but significantly attenuated OGD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3-MA also significantly increased the number of GFAP-positive cells and the protein levels of GFAP in the ischemic cortex core 12 h following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced autophagic/lysosomal pathway activation may at least partly contribute to ischemic injury of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
