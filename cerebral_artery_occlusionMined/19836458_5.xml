<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NO may be toxic by formation of peroxinitrite after a reaction between NO and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> appears to be one of the major pathways leading to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of three types of NOS, nNOS is neurotoxic in early and iNOS in late stage of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (TFCI), while eNOS is neuroprotective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the neuroprotective effect of a preferential iNOS inhibitor s-methylisothiourea (SMT) at 0, 8, 24 and 48h as multiple injections (30 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2h) and reperfusion (72h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 72h of reperfusion, animals were sacrificed for studying the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and neuro-behavioral abnormality was assessed at 24, 48 and 72h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SMT reduced significantly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neuro-behavioral abnormality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, number of apoptotic cells in penumbra and NOx levels in plasma and brain both at 30 and 100mg/kg in dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> measured by rhodamine assay was significantly reduced by SMT, as compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SMT protected Neuro 2a cells against <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, SMT may possibly targeting both constitutive as well as inducible NOS at varying time interval to elicit neuroprotection in TFCI rats </plain></SENT>
