<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the two methods, UNICAR is easier to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to comprehensively compare the two reperfusion methods to determine if there are any differences in outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The UNICAR and BICAR groups each included 9 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the average pO2 was 20.54 ± 9.35 and 26.43 ± 7.39, for the UNICAR and BICAR groups, respectively (P = 0.519) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in pO2, as well as other physiological parameters measured within the ischemic lesion, were similar between the UNICAR and BICAR groups during 90 min of MCAO and the first 30 min of reperfusion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both the Bederson score and Garcia score, which are used for neurological assessment, were also similar (both P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also no significant differences in T2WI lesion volume, DWI lesion volume, PWI lesion volume, or TTC staining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between the two groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: UNICAR and BICAR have similar capability for inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain ischemic injury and can be considered interchangeable up to 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
