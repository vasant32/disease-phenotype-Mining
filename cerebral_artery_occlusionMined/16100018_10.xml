<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether affiliative social interactions before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> improve ischemic outcomes as assessed through histological analysis and behavioral assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were housed individually or with an ovariectomized female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral assessments were made 24 hours before 60 or 90 minutes of transient intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or SHAM surgery and after 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours after behavioral testing on day 7, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium histology, and blood samples were collected for assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pair housing significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved contralateral paw use in 60-minute MCAO males and 90-minute MCAO females compared with socially isolated cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Housing condition had no significant effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in females that underwent 60 minutes of MCAO, but pair housing was associated with improved contralateral paw use relative to socially isolated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort of males, intraischemic CRP concentration was significantly reduced in pair-housed males relative to isolated males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Affiliative interaction during the peri-ischemic period reduces intraischemic CRP concentration, decreases ischemic damage in male and female mice, and improves behavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
