<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cynomolgus female monkeys were subjected to four different <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion durations (15-60 min) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (45-50 mm Hg mean arterial blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amplitude and central conduction time (CCT) of the median nerve SEP were recorded preceding, during, and following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were established based on the development of SI ischemic lesions: animals developing SI lesions formed the SI-lesion group (n = 9), and animals without ischemic lesions or with lesions outside the SI cortex formed the SI-spared group (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in the SEP during and following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion under conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were similar to those reported by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SEP disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals within 15 min of occlusion and reappeared 5 min following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several differences were observed between the SI-lesion and SI-spared groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SI-lesion group had a more rapid decrease in SEP amplitude during the first 5 min of occlusion and had smaller SEP amplitudes and longer CCTs during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that changes in SEP amplitude and latency during and immediately following temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion predict development of SI ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
