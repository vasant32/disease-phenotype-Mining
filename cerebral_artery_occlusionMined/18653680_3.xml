<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion is more common than generally thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to assess the cerebral hemodynamic status in patients with this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances in these patients in relation to the development of the collateral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion who had a minor or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET was performed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen 15</z:chebi> ((15)O) gas steady-state inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intracranial arteries were evaluated by digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into 2 subgroups according to whether they had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and compared the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, 9 were classified into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF and 4 were classified into the increased OEF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the increased OEF group, the mean OEF values were also increased in the territories of the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery, ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients in the increased OEF group had more than 1 steno-occlusive lesion in the major intracranial arteries (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 patients in the increased OEF group also had vascular lesions in the collateral pathways to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion did not show severe hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those with increased OEF tended to have other areas of severe hemodynamic impairment and other vascular lesions, especially in the collateral pathways </plain></SENT>
