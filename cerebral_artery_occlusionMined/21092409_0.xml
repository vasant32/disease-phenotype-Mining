<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the effects of striatal stimulation (SS) in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulation electrode was implanted into the ischemic penumbra at 1 month after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and thereafter continuously delivered SS over a period of 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were evaluated behaviorally coupled with neuroradiological assessment of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at pre- and post-SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats with SS showed significant behavioral recovery in the spontaneous activity and limb placement test compared to those without SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI visualized that SS also significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared to that at pre-SS or without SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a robust neurogenic response in rats that received SS characterized by a stream of proliferating cells from the subventricular zone migrating to and subsequently differentiating into neurons in the ischemic penumbra, which exhibited a significant GDNF upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In tandem with this SS-mediated neurogenesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> was also recognized as revealed by a significant increase in VEGF levels in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that SS affords neurorestoration at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by stimulating endogenous neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
