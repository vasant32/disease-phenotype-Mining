<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A synthetic heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> compound, MS-818 (2-piperadino-6-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-5-oxo-5,6-dihydro-(7H) pyrrolo-[3,4-d] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> maleate) is reported to have a variety of biological activities including neurite outgrowth, astrocyte differentiation, suppression of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, regeneration of injured peripheral nerves, fracture repairs, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and superovulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To be able to explicate the neurotrophic effects of MS-818, the authors evaluated its effect on the reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and amelioration of sensorimotor dysfunction in a rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and assigned to one of four treatment groups (10 animals in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MS-818 (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (control group) was administered intraperitoneally at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and again 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed 48 hours after they underwent surgery to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined using an image-analysis computer software program following staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postischemic neurological deficit and body weight were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (total and cortical infarction) were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the MS-818-treated groups compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MS-818 induced significant amelioration of sensorimotor dysfunction, as indicated by the results of forelimb and hindlimb placing tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that MS-818, which has a much smaller molecular weight than neurotrophic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>. represents a new approach to the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
