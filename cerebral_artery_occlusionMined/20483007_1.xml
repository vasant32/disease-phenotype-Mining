<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An infarction model was induced by ligating the left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in a total of 66 adult Sprague-Dawley rats that were further randomly divided into three groups: the physical exercise group (n=30), which was given running wheel exercise every day after MCAO, the control group (n=30) and sham-operated group (n=6), which were fed in standard cages without any special training exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed on the third, seventh and fourteenth days and the neurological severity scores were examined for evaluating the neural function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And the neogenetic microvessels around the peri-infarction region were checked with the specific marker CD31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although neogenetic microvessels in the peri-infarction region were observed in both control group and physical exercise group, which showed the highest signal on the seventh day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the number of CD31 positive cells significantly increased in physical exercise group in comparison with those in control group on the seventh and fourteenth days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neurological severity scores in the physical exercise group showed more quick declination as compared to those in control group from the seventh day after ischemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that physical exercise plays an important role in the recovery of damaged neural function and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
