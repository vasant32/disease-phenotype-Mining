<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have modified an existing model of endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion to enable controlled reperfusion without damage to the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin-3 (ET-3) were injected via a double-injection cannula into brain parenchyma adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of anesthetized rats to produce focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ET-1 and ET-3 produced large ischemic lesions that were restricted to those cortical and subcortical structures supplied by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of ischemic damage produced by 100 pmol of ET-1 and ET-3 was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endothelin-A (ET(A)) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> FR139317 (3 or 30 nmol) injected 10 min after ET-1 did not significantly alter the volume of damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the lesion produced by ET-3 was completely inhibited by FR139317 at the 10 min time-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FR139317 partially attenuated the ET-3-induced lesion when administered 30 min post-occlusion, but injection 90 min following ET-3 produced a lesion not different to that produced by ET-3 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were supported by laser Doppler flowmetry which determined FR139317 induces reperfusion when injected 10 or 90 min following ET-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ET-3-induced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is therefore amenable to reversal by the ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> FR139317, and this model may offer a means to investigate the neuropathology of reperfusion without the procedure-related artifacts associated with some reperfusion models </plain></SENT>
