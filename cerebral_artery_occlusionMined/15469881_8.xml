<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the changes in the CSF proteome in rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to detect the time-course changes in CSF protein patterns after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to hierarchical cluster analysis by self-organising tree algorism (SOTA), the temporal pattern of protein peaks was divided into four groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increase group, gradual decrease group and unchanged group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase group, the expression of a 13.6-kDa protein was markedly increased during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 13.6-kDa protein was identified as monomeric form of transthyretin using two-dimensional electrophoresis and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The monomeric transthyretin may represent an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-specific CSF marker to indicate the sequential changes according to ischemic insults of the brain </plain></SENT>
