<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest that low-frequency transcranial ultrasound (LFTUS) can enhance thrombolysis, but other studies suggest that it may have adverse effects on intracranial tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that LFTUS with appropriate parameters was effective and safe in a normotensive rat model of thromboembolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to test the safety of this strategy in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Right MCAO was achieved in male SHRs using intraluminal nylon sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats exhibiting left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to one of four different groups: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (NS) group (n = 8), intravenous administration of NS as placebo at 3 h after MCAO; (2) NS+LFTUS group (n = 10), NS administration with simultaneous application of LFTUS (480.4 kHz, continuous wave, at an intensity of 0.3 W/cm(2)) for 1 h; (3) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) group (n = 11), intravenous administration of alteplase (10 mg/kg body weight) over 1 h instead of NS; or (4) tPA+LFTUS group (n = 11), tPA administration and application of LFTUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after treatment, neurological change was evaluated, and brains were removed and examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.09) when comparing changes in neurologic status and body weight, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratio, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> ratio, or hemorrhagic transformation among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that sonothrombolytic treatment with LFTUS with appropriate parameters is safe when used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats under the undesired permanent MCAO condition </plain></SENT>
