<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although tandem internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>; TIM) occlusion has been associated with low recanalization rate after IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), its independent contribution on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whether the relative resistance to thrombolysis in tandem lesions varies depending on the location of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clot remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion treated with IV tPA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emergent carotid artery ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD) examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed on TCD at 2 hours of tPA bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were obtained at baseline and after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modifed Rankin Scale score was used to assess outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median prebolus NIHSS score was 16 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On TCD, 156 (71.6%) patients had a proximal and 65 (29.4%) a distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TIM occlusion was identified in 44 (19.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (41.9%) patients with and 123 (69.5%) without TIM lesions achieved an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> &gt;140 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.8) and the presence of TIM occlusion (OR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.9) emerged as independent predictors of absence of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the independent contribution of TIM lesions on poor response to thrombolysis varied depending on the location of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TIM occlusion independently predicted resistance to thrombolysis in patients with proximal (OR 4.63, 95% CI, 1.79 to 11.96), but not in those with distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with TIM occlusion had worse short- (P&lt;0.0001) and long-term (P&lt;0.0001) clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TIM occlusion independently predicts poor outcome after IV thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, its impact varies depending on the location of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, emergent carotid ultrasound plus TCD examinations may improve the selection of patients for more aggressive reperfusion strategies </plain></SENT>
