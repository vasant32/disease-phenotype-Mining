<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The factors that predict favorable outcome after local intra-arterial thrombolysis (LIT) remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify these factors in patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated by LIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed LIT in 26 consecutive patients who had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score &lt;or=2 before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed background characteristics, angiographic findings, and mRS score at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared these factors between patients with good outcome (mRS score, &lt;or=2) and those with poor outcome (mRS score, &gt;or=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to hospital admission was 0.96 +/- 0.87 (mean +/- SD) hour and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to LIT was 3.78 +/- 1.17 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients developed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients achieved good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences existed between the two groups in baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores, time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to LIT, blood pressure, early CT signs, or subsequent hemorrhagic transformation shown by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, univariate analysis showed that patients with good outcomes were younger, more often had absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> history, had better collaterals shown by angiography, and had better recanalization rates than those with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores after LIT were lower in patients with good outcomes than in patients with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis indicated improvement of the NIHSS scores by &gt;or=2 immediately after LIT was independently associated with good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improvement of the NIHSS score by &gt;or=2 immediately after LIT is a useful predictor of patient outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
