<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed 2, 6 or 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain specific gravity, an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, was determined on samples from the prefrontal, frontal, parietal and occipital cortex and the caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SHR the brain specific gravity was significantly reduced in the right hemisphere at 2, but not at 6 or 24 h after a temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After permanent ligation, the specific gravity markedly decreased with time in the right hemisphere in SHR with significant difference from WKY, as well as from the left hemisphere, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data support the concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> aggravates ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after an arterial ligation </plain></SENT>
