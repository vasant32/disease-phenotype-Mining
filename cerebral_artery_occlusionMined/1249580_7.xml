<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cortical tissue oxygen measured by a <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> cathode, and cerebral blood flow recorded by a hydrogen clearance technique, were measured in 13 baboons before, during and after temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean control pO2 was 23.8 +/- 14 mm Hg and mean flow 51.3 +/- 12 ml/100g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the occlusion, there was a gradation in pO2 from values in the opercular area of 3.6 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, to values in the high parietal area of 11.9 +/- 11.7, these being statistically different (P less than 0.05) from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding flow values were 5.5 +/- 7.5 (opercular) and 22.3 +/- 21.7 ml/100 g/min parietal (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following removal of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clip, between 20% and 30% of the electrodes registered an early <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> and hyperaemia, which lasted up to 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A late and prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, with less evidence of hyperaemia, was also noted in about 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean tissue pO2, however, at 5-min intervals up to 40 min following the removal of the clip only reached 60-80% of control values in the most ischaemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the parietal region showed a mean pO2 above control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean flow data were uniformly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions to about 80% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During and after a second occlusion in 6 animals, similar changes were noted but with even fewer instances of <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean oxygen and flow results were lower than with the first occlusion, but the reduction was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no overall effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> on cortical tissue pO2 during the control period, but there was a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction during the same procedure after the period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increase in pO2 during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> could be observed if there were arousal responses of blood pressure "spikes" </plain></SENT>
