<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the effect of C3a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (C3aRA) on <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> into the ischemic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient or permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57Bl/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal C3aRA or vehicle was administered 45 mins before or 1 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after occlusion, we harvested brain tissue and purified inflammatory cells using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1 protein levels were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and ICAM-1 and C3a receptor (C3aR) expression was confirmed via immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the transient MCAO model, animals receiving C3aRA showed smaller <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, less upregulation of C3aR-positive granulocytes, and less ICAM-1 protein on endothelial cells than vehicle-treated animals; no significant differences in other inflammatory cell populations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C3a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>-treated and vehicle-treated animals showed no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume or inflammatory cell populations after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that blocking the binding of C3a to C3aR modulates tissue injury in reperfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by inhibiting the recruitment of neutrophils to the ischemic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It further establishes antagonism of the C3a anaphylatoxin as a promising strategy for ameliorating injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
