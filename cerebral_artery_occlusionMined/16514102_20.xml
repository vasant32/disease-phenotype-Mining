<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> achieves arterial recanalization in approximately 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determining temporal profile of recanalization may address patient selection and potential benefits of further rescue reperfusion techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 179 consecutive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-treated patients with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous transcranial Doppler assessed recanalization (none-partial-complete) at 60 minutes (early), 120 minutes (delayed) after t-PA bolus, and 6 hours (late) from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were determined: National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS; 48-hour NIHSS) and 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, 68% of patients presented proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, median NIHSS 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization was complete for 30 patients (17%), partial for 50 (28%), and none for 99 (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed recanalization was complete for 56 patients (31%), partial for 39 (22%), and none for 84 (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although early flow improvement was observed in up to 45% of patients, only 19% of patients with persistent occlusion (11% of total) presented delayed recanalization (odds ratio [OR] delayed/early recanalization, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.085 to 0.304; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with persistent occlusion at 2 hours, only 13 (7% of total) presented late flow improvement (OR late/early recanalization, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.043 to 0.196; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The few patients with late recanalization presented comparable median 48-hour NIHSS to those with early/delayed recanalization (3 versus 4.5; P=0.9) and much lower than those with persistent occlusion after 6 hours (3 versus 15; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the rate of mRS &lt; or =2 was not statistically different between patients with early/delayed versus late recanalization (55% versus 86%; P=0.12) but was lower if occlusion persisted 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (22%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of t-PA-induced recanalizations occur during the first hour after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recanalizations during the following hours are rare but still related to clinical improvement if achieved within 6 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rescue reperfusion techniques should be considered if flow improvement is not observed 60 minutes after t-PA bolus </plain></SENT>
