<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that following i.v. injection of 30 ng/kg of PACAP38 in rats exposed to 2 h of MCAO focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and 48 h reoxygenation, 50 % neuroprotection was measured by reduced caspase-3 activity and volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar neuroprotective effects were measured upon PACAP38 treatment of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and reoxygenation of brain cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection was temporally associated with increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphorylation of its receptor-tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (trkB), activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase and Akt, and reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PACAP38 increased expression of neuronal markers beta-tubulin III, microtubule-associated protein-2, and growth-associated protein-43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PACAP38 induced stimulation of Rac and suppression of Rho GTPase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PACAP38 downregulated the nerve growth factor receptor (p75(NTR)) and associated Nogo-(Neurite outgrowth-A) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results propose that PACAP exhibits neuroprotective effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by three mechanisms: a direct one, mediated by PACAP receptors, and two indirect, induced by neurotrophin release, activation of the trkB receptors and attenuation of neuronal growth inhibitory signaling molecules p75(NTR) and Nogo receptor </plain></SENT>
