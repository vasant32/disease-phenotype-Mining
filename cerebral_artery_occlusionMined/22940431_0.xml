<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte activation is a hallmark of the response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> consisting of changes in gene expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) protects from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and although several protective mechanisms have been investigated, effects on astrocyte activation have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify potential mechanisms of protection, microarray analysis was used to assess gene expression in the ischemic hemispheres of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and Hsp72-overexpressing (Hsp72Tg) mice 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> both genotypes exhibited changes in genes related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and stress, with more downregulated genes in Hsp72Tg and more <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes increased in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genes indicative of astrocyte activation were also upregulated in both genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To measure the extent and time course of astrocyte activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, detailed histological and morphological analyses were performed in the cortical penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a marked and persistent increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and a transient increase in vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No change in overall astrocyte number was observed based on glutamine synthetase immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hsp72Tg and WT mice were compared for density of astrocytes expressing activation markers and astrocytic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In animals with comparable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, overexpression of Hsp72 reduced the density of GFAP- and vimentin-expressing cells, and decreased astrocyte morphological complexity 72 h following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, by 30 days astrocyte activation was similar between genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that early modulation of astrocyte activation provides an additional novel mechanism associated with Hsp72 overexpression in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
