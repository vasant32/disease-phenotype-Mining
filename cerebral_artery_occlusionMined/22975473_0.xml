<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a positive influence of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surgery on recovery and survival in a commonly used experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of male, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 underwent the procedure without any prior intervention whilst group 2 had an additional <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anaesthetic</z:chebi> 6 days prior to tMCAO for a cranial burrhole and durotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery was assessed using a 32 point neurological deficit score and tapered beam walk and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume determined from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 2 survival was 92% (n=12) versus 67% in group 1 (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, post-tMCAO associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in experimental outcomes: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (Group 1 317±18.6 mm³ versus Group 2 332±20.4 mm³), and serial (day 0-14 post-tMCAO) neurological deficit scores and tapered-beam walk test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drilling a cranial burrhole under general anaesthesia prior to tMCAO in SHRSP reduced mortality and gave rise to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological deficits similar to those recorded in surviving Group 1 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methodological refinement has significant implications for animal welfare and group sizes required for intervention studies </plain></SENT>
