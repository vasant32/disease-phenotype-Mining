<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human CRP binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and can then activate complement and its proinflammatory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rat CRP, which binds to similar ligands, does not activate complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, systemic complement <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with cobra venom factor in adult rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not affect cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, indicating that circulating complement does not contribute to injury in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, we have previously reported that administration of human CRP to rats undergoing coronary artery ligation caused a marked increase in size of the resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, associated with codeposition of human CRP and rat complement in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that adult rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and then treated with human CRP similarly developed significantly larger cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with control subjects receiving human serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human CRP can thus contribute to ischemic tissue damage in the brain as well as in the heart, and inhibition of CRP binding may therefore be a promising target for tissue protective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> therapeutic intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
