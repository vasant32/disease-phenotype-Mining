<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The delayed neuroprotection induced by PF preconditioning and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a dosage of 20 or 40 mg/kg, PF preconditioning 48 h before MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion significantly reduced the mortality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reversed the neurological deficits caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the ameliorative effects on mortality, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and neurological impairment induced by MCAO emerged as well when PF was administered 24 h, 48 h, or 5 days before MCAO at the dose of 20 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, comparative proteomics analysis was adopted to identify the differentially expressed proteins induced by PF preconditioning itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative levels of 42 proteins were altered after PF preconditioning, among which 20 were elevated and 22 reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, A(1) receptor-regulator of G protein signaling-K(ATP) signaling, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> cascade, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> system, markers of neuronal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage-related molecules, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB pathway are associated with the mechanisms of PF preconditioning </plain></SENT>
