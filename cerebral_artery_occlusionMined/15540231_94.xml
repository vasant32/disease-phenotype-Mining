<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The long-term (4-month) responses to treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the older adult rat, using rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs), have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retired breeder rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) alone, or injected intravenously with 3 x 10(6) MSCs, at 7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was measured using an adhesive-removal patch test and a modified neurological severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine, a cell proliferation marker, was injected daily for 14 before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining was used to identify cell proliferation and cell types for axons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSC treatment induced significant improvement in neurological outcome after MCAo compared with control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSC treatment reduced the thickness of the scar wall (P &lt; 0.05) and reduced the numbers of microglia/macrophages within the scar wall (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed increased expression of an axonal marker (GAP-43), among reactive astrocytes in the scar boundary zone and in the subventricular zone in the treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine in cells preferentially colocalized with markers of astrocytes (GFAP) and oligodendrocytes (RIP) in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and gliogenesis was enhanced in the subventricular zone of the rats treated with MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to show that MSCs injected at 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> improve long-term neurological outcome in older animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue repair is an ongoing process with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, which persists for at least 4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reactive astrocytes responding to MSC treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may also promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> during long-term recovery </plain></SENT>
