<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, which plays an important role in memory, levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in the ischemic group could not be detected the significant difference compared with those in the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But in the anterior cortex and the caudate-putamen, levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in the ischemic group were recognized the significant difference compared with those in the sham operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover activities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase, which is the synthetic enzyme of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, and activities of acetylcholinesterase, which is the degradative enzyme of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, were measured in the anterior cortex which was recognized decrease of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> level and the hippocampus which could not be detected the difference of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activities of both enzymes in the hippocampus could not be recognized the significant difference between the ischemic group and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But in the anterior cortex activities of both enzymes in the ischemic group were significantly decreased compared with those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that these decreases in the ischemic group were due to damage of injection of cholinergic neuron from Meynert nucleus (basal nucleus of Meynert) to anterior cortex </plain></SENT>
