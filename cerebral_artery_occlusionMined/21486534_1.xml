<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilobalide is an active constituent of Ginkgo biloba and has shown neuroprotective effects in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated brain permeability of bilobalide (i) in healthy mice and (ii) in mice before or after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used in vivo microdialysis and LC-MS to estimate extracellular levels of bilobalide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10 mg/kg of bilobalide was given by i.p. injection to control mice, and 60 minutes before and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilobalide was already detectable in brain striatal microdialysates 10 min after i.p. administration and reached maximum levels (19 ng/mL, corresponding to 0.92 µM) after 40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximum plasma bilobalide levels were 5.9 µM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After an ischemic insult, the drug could be dialysed with similar efficiency as in control mice indicating slow elimination from the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the drug was given after MCAO, availability in the brain was low, but measurable, at approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>10% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that bilobalide easily crosses the blood brain barrier and reaches extracellular concentrations in the brain that allow efficient interaction with target molecules such as neurotransmitter receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Availability of the drug in ischemic tissue is high when given before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but severely limited after MCAO </plain></SENT>
