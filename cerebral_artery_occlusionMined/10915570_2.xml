<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other studies have also described subcortical alterations consecutive to focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a better understanding of ischemic processes in exofocal areas, we have investigated the evolution of opioidergic receptors following focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> through the quantification of relative binding densities, B(max) and K(d) values for the mu, delta, and kappa subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that opioid receptor subtypes exhibit adaptations at distance from the ischemic core, mainly in the striatum, the thalamus, and the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, mu and delta B(max) values were increased in ventral thalamic nuclei, while kappa relative binding densities were transiently increased in nucleus medialis dorsalis and nucleus lateralis, pars posterior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the B(max) of mu and delta receptors were transiently decreased at 6 h post-MCAO in ipsi- and contralateral patches and matrices of the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the mu B(max) values were increased in ipsi- and contralateral substantia nigra, pars compacta, and pars reticulata, 24 h following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contralateral substantia nigra, pars compacta, kappa B(max) was found to be decreased at 24 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations could reflect neuronal dysfunction in exofocal brain structures, consecutively to the degeneration of defined neuroanatomical pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that opioidergic receptors could be used as markers of the neuronal reorganization that take place in subcortical areas following an ischemic insult of the brain cortex </plain></SENT>
