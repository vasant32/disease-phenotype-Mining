<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate whether isradipine pretreatment caused early (0-3 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) ischemic changes in diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and if such changes were predictive of previously documented protection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An initial dose-response study using neurological deficit scores and estimates of protection from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (by histology) showed that isradipine reduced cortical infarctions compared to vehicle-treated animals at most doses (between 1.25 and 5 mg/kg/day s.c. for 6 days) with the best results obtained at 5 mg/kg/day, where a 78.5% reduction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dose was utilized to perform the DWI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early quantitative estimates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, as measured by DWI at 1, 2 and 3 h after MCAO, were similar to those obtained with late histology at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that in pretreatment protocols, DWI can be used to quantitatively predict areas at risk of permanent damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work also demonstrates that neurological deficits, developing from the damaged forebrain following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, may provide an index of isradipine's neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
