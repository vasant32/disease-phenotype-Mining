<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ginkgolide B (GB) has potent neuroprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms of GB's neuroprotection remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage, and NF-κB is considered to be a key player in these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the detailed mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of GB on inflammatory and apoptotic responses induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model was produced by using an intraluminal filament technique in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GB (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (i.v.) 2h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that MCAO-induced cerebral injury was associated with an upregulation of p-IKK, p-IκB-α and degradation of IκB-α, indicating of NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile activation of microglial and increases in levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore upregulation of the expression of NF-κB target gene p53 and p53 downstream gene Bax, but downregulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GB treatment showed marked reduction in infarction volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GB also inhibited I/R induced NF-κB, microglia activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that GB reduced Bax protein levels and increased Bcl-2 protein levels in the post-ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that GB's neuroprotection is attributable to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect through inhibition of NF-κB </plain></SENT>
