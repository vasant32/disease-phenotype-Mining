<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basal fractional <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> outputs were almost constant from 1 to 7 h after the start of perfusion (5.9-8.4 pg/30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depolarization by perfusion with a high K+ (100 mM)-containing medium produced a significant (124%) increase and neuronal blockade by perfusion with a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi> (1 microM)-containing medium resulted in a 68% reduction in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output was markedly reduced by intraperitoneal injection of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (100 mg/kg), an irreversible inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, or (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (5 mg/kg), a potent and specific H3-receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output gradually increased, and reached four times the control value 8 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When rats were pretreated with metoprine (10 mg/kg), a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> N-methyltransferase inhibitor, there was no significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded and the sham-operated groups during the first 3.5 h after the operation, but the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output gradually increased thereafter in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats treated with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion failed to cause an increase in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion induces a long-lasting increase in neuronal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> release in the rat striatum </plain></SENT>
