<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to compare the antiseizure profile of ethosuximide (EXM; 125-312.5 mg/kg i.v.) and gabapentin (GBP; 0.3-50 mg/kg. i.v.) in a rat model of <z:mp ids='MP_0000948'>nonconvulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were detected by continuous electroencephalographic monitoring for 24 h following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both "preseizure" and "postseizure" treatment effects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control rats experienced a 91% incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi>(averaging 10-11 NCS/rat), which was significantly reduced following preseizure treatment (delivered 20 min post-MCAo) with either EXM (ED(50) = 161 mg/kg) or GBP (ED(50) = 10.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to preseizure treatment effects, only GBP reduced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> when given after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further, albeit nonsignificant, 20% reduction in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> incidence was measured when given in combination postseizure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which was positively correlated to the number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> events (r = 0.475; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EXM and GBP treatment of cultured neurons exposed to neurotoxic or ischemic insults showed no neuroprotective effects, suggesting that in vivo neuroprotection can be attributed to anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EXM and GBP significantly attenuate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in a dose-related manner and may help to improve patient outcome from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
