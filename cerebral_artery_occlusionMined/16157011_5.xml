<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 32 male Sprague--Dawley rats were subjected to a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the hypothermic group, rats (n=10) underwent selective brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for 5 hours with the use of a novel surface coil with coolant circulating inside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control (n=13) and sham groups (n=9), the rats were maintained at normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a period of 168 hours <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, animals were killed to measure the infarction volume of the brain stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in physiological parameters except for the temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present style of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly reduced infarction volume in the cortex and caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The present results endorse the neuroprotective effect of our method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at an endpoint of 1 week under the following two conditions: (1) reduction of muscle and caudoputamen temperature to 29 and 31 degrees C, respectively; (2) maintenance of the mean arterial blood pressure above 90 mmHg during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
