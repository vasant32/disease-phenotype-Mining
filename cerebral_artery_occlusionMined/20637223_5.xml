<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">Baicalein</z:chebi>, isolated from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Huangqin, is an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> on one hand and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> on the other hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi>'s neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> and explored the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> was administered intravenously immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24h after MCAO neurological deficit, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to analyse the expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX), p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at gene and protein levels in ischemic brain cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> improved neurological deficit, reduced brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes, and downregulated the overexpression of 12/15-LOX, p38 MAPK and cPLA2 typically seen with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO, and this effect may be through downregulation of 12/15-LOX, p38 MAPK and cPLA2 expression </plain></SENT>
