<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the influence of flow diversion as a marker of leptomeningeal collateralization on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and penumbral volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed consecutive patients presenting within six-hours of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anterior cerebral artery flow diversion, defined as ipsilateral mean velocity of at least 30% greater than the contralateral artery, was used as the Doppler index of leptomeningeal collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of anterior cerebral artery flow diversion, controlling for other important clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptomeningeal collateralization was also graded on computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> core and penumbral volumes were defined using computed tomography perfusion thresholds of cerebral blood volume and mean transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, reperfusion, and vessel status were measured at 24 h using magnetic resonance techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients qualified for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anterior cerebral artery flow diversion was associated with good collateral flow on computed tomography angiography (P &lt; 0·001) and was an independent predictor of admission <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core volume (P &lt; 0·001), and 24 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of a favourable outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-2) was higher (odds ratio = 27·5, P &lt; 0·001) in those with flow diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cerebral artery flow diversion indicates effective leptomeningeal collateralization as measured by computed tomography angiography, and independently predicts <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and 90-day clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Flow diversion appears to provide penumbral perfusion, offering some protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion </plain></SENT>
