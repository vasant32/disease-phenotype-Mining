<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We reported previously that ecdysterone (EDS) improves neurologic function after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to test whether ecdysterone improves neurologic function by enhancing astrocyte activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was conducted by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EDS was intraperitoneally injected at 20 mg kg1 daily for 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic recovery was assessed using the neurologic severity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density and GFAP expression were detected with immunostaining and analyzed quantitatively with image system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with EDS significantly improved functional recovery, along with increases in density of cerebral microvessels and astrocyte activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density was significantly higher in EDS treated group than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> control group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points, and reached a peak on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EDS treated group had substantial increment in GFAP immunoreactive cells, darker staining color, more and longer nerve processes, higher GFAP expression and area of immunoreactive cells at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that EDS treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and astrocyte activation which could contribute to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
