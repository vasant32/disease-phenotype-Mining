<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Either U74006F or vehicle only was administered 15 min, 2h, 6h, 12h and 24h after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dialysate was analysed for on-line pH, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of post-ischaemic treatment was shown by: a) lesion volume 53h after operation was significantly smaller in U74006F-treated animals; b) microdialytic findings were very similar to those found previously with pre-ischaemic drug application (reduction in release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, increased pH); c) an effect of U74006F on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> release could still be seen on days 2 and 3; and d) increases in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> on days 2 and 3, possibly reflecting delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were smaller in aminosteroid treated animals </plain></SENT>
