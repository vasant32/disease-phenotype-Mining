<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the increased understanding of treadmill training on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, its effects on different age groups are not clearly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study presents such effects through a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on young and old groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of treadmill training on young and old rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty old (22-24 months of age) and 32 young (3-4 months of age) rats underwent the MCAO procedure for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats that survived the procedure were randomly assigned to a 1- or a 2-week treadmill training group, or a time-matched control group (n=6-8 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was compared between the treadmill training and the control groups for both the young and old rats at 1 or 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treadmill training for 1 week, the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 7.26+/-0.49 and 9.51+/-0.84% for the young and old rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-week treadmill training effect was significant in the young rats (p=0.0207) but not in the old rats (p=0.0840) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 6.84+/-0.51 and 7.63+/-0.52% for the young and old rats, respectively, after the 2-week treadmill training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the young and old rat groups demonstrated a significant reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with that of the control group (p=0.021 for the young group and p=0.039 for the old group) after 2 weeks of treadmill training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present findings clearly demonstrate the different training effects of locomotor activity in reducing ischemic infarction in young and old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The delayed reduction in ischemic infarction in old rats was notable and may be attributable to the slow response of angiogenic and neurogenic mechanisms in the old rats </plain></SENT>
