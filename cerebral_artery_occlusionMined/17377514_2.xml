<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative diffusion-(DWI), perfusion-(PWI), T(1)-(T1WI), T(2)-weighted (T2WI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed before, during, and up to 7 days after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (eMCAO) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Region of interest (ROI) analysis was used to evaluate structural and functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes within three ROIs defined by the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), cerebral blood flow (CBF) signatures, and final tissue viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI, PWI, and T2WI lesion volumes were calculated using previously established viability thresholds and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes ascertained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial MRI demonstrated spontaneous reperfusion of initially hypoperfused <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> regions accompanied by substantial reduction of initial <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF lesions and gradual recovery of neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery rates of CBF/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> abnormalities differed among ROIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed persistent tissue dysfunction after the recovery of the CBF/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study may facilitate our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms by which early, spontaneous reperfusion affects tissue fate and neurological function </plain></SENT>
