<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although much evidence suggests that these cells are multipotent in vitro, their differentiation potential in vivo under physiological or pathophysiological conditions is still controversial.To follow the fate of polydendrocytes after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathology, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), a commonly used model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, was carried out on adult NG2creBAC:ZEG double transgenic mice, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed in polydendrocytes and their progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the EGFP(+) cells was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the patch-clamp technique 3, 7 and 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated mice (control), EGFP(+) cells in the cortex expressed protein markers and displayed electrophysiological properties of polydendrocytes and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any co-labeling of EGFP with neuronal, microglial or astroglial markers in this region, thus proving polydendrocyte unipotent differentiation potential under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after MCAo the number of EGFP(+) cells in the gliotic tissue dramatically increased when compared to control animals, and these cells displayed properties of proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in later phases after MCAo a large subpopulation of EGFP(+) cells expressed protein markers and electrophysiological properties of astrocytes that contribute to the formation of glial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, some EGFP(+) cells displayed membrane properties typical for neural precursor cells, and moreover these cells expressed doublecortin (DCX)--a marker of newly-derived neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data indicate that polydendrocytes in the dorsal cortex display multipotent differentiation potential after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
