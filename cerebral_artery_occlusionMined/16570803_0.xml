<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat was made by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(MACO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infraction weight was determined by TTC stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SOD, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, GSH and apoptotis were determined with different method respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: TGRP 20, 10 mg x kg(-1) ig markedly improved the abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> symptoms, incredsed the SOD, GSH activity and reduced contentes of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in brain of MACO rat, TGRP 20 mg x kg(-1) ig significantly decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells in ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TGRP has protective effects against cerebral infraction, and its mechanism may be related to anti-apoptotis and free radical </plain></SENT>
