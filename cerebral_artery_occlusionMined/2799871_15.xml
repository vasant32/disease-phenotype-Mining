<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used the Fink-Heimer method to study degenerating corticofugal axons after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 14 adult male Long-Evans hooded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>Axonal degeneration</z:mp> in the pyramidal tracts was prominent at 1-3 weeks, manifesting in well-defined silver-impregnated axonal bundles coursing from the internal capsule to the pyramids and crossing completely to the contralateral spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In half of eight rats examined at 1-3 weeks, the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> included the forelimb region of the sensorimotor cortex, and degenerating corticospinal axons could be traced to the lower cervical segments; in rats with involvement of the hindlimb cortical area as well, <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> extended to the lumbosacral segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal degeneration products were present in the forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem within 2 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>; the number of degenerating terminals peaked at 7 days and decreased gradually thereafter up to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dense terminal degeneration was observed in the trigeminal nuclear complex of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven rats studied at 2 and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these seven rats, five had small cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and silver-impregnated terminals were observed in the lateral reticular formation; in two rats with large cortical lesions, terminal degeneration was prominent in the medial reticular formation as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> in the brainstem and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Fink-Heimer method may be useful for evaluating the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
