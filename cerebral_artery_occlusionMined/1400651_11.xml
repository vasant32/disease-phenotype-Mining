<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When using a nonoxygen binding fluid, the therapeutic efficacy of hemodilution-induced increases in CBF are offset by concomitant decreases in oxygen content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of hemodilution, with diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (DCLHb), on CBF during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were hemodiluted to one of the following hematocrits (Hct): (a) 44/Hct, (b) 37/Hct, (c) 30/Hct, (d) 23/Hct, (e) 16/Hct, or (f) 9/Hct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 10 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, CBF was determined with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain sections were evaluated for areas with a CBF of 0-10 and 11-20 ml 100 g-1 min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, oxygen delivery was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the center of the ischemic zone, both areas of low CBF were less in the 30/Hct, 23/Hct, and 16/Hct groups compared with the 44/Hct and 37/Hct groups; and both areas were less in the 9/Hct group compared with the other five groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the hemisphere contralateral to occlusion, there was a direct correlation between hematocrit and oxygen delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, for the hemisphere ipsilateral to occlusion, oxygen delivery increased as hematocrit decreased (44/Hct, 8.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 9/Hct, 13.6 +/- 0.4 [mean +/- SD, ml 100 g-1 min-1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support a hypothesis that hemodilution with DCLHb decreases the extent of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
