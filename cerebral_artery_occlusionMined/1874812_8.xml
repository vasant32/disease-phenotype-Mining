<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The zone of retrieval was anatomically constant, consisting of a rim of cortex dorsal and ventral to the infarction and medially within the thalamus and striatum corresponding to the penumbral zone described by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect was comparable in rats of the SD strain having smaller infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of FN stimulation appears to be selective for the FN system in that it is not evoked by stimulation of the dentate nucleus and is blocked by systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (1.0 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that excitation of an intrinsic system in brain represented in the rostral FN has the capacity to reduce substantially an ischemic infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
