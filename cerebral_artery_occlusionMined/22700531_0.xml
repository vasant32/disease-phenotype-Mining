<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the factors triggering ubiquitination and their impact on the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the relationship between ubiquitin aggregation and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and proteasomal activity in a mouse model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Free ubiquitin and ubiquitin aggregate levels were examined by Western blotting in the mouse neocortex and striatum after different periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52295">thionin</z:chebi>-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteasome activity was studied by fluorometric peptidase activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, ubiquitin aggregates were detected in the ipsilateral neocortex and, to a lesser extent, striatum only after induction of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, no ubiquitin aggregates were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shorter ischemic periods producing no or minimal tissue damage (10-15 minutes) resulted in ubiquitin aggregate levels similar to those produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulting in substantial infarction (30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proteasomal impairment was greatest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> without reperfusion, in which no ubiquitin aggregates were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that reperfusion rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> leads to the appearance of ubiquitinated aggregates, which form in the absence of major tissue damage and are not correlated with decreased proteasomal peptidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin aggregates may form in potentially viable brain tissue, which may be later recruited into infarction by factors independent of ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
