<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in female Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bladder activity was monitored by continuous infusion cystometrography in awake rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were obtained from the pontine tegmental area 1, 3, 5, 12 and 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of 0.1 mg./kg. intravenously of the N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> glutamatergic receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 on bladder activity, and c-fos and zif268 expression after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed with the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> influences on gene expression in the pontine tegmental area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats was significantly reduced 1 to 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with that of sham operated rats (p &lt;0.05 to 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour after occlusion mean c-fos messenger (m)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression plus or minus standard error had significantly increased to 18.9 +/- 4.0 in terms of its density relative to the outer control in a sample obtained immediately after occlusion compared with that in sham operated rats (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It returned to the control level within 3 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean zif268 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression significantly increased to a relative density of 3.2 +/- 1.4 3 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p &lt;0.01) and returned to the control level within 5 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expressions of c-jun, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tissue plasminogen activator was not influenced by occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK-801 inhibited bladder overactivity and significantly reduced the expression of c-fos and zif268 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the pontine tegmental area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the development of bladder overactivity after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is mediated by activation of an N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> receptor and accompanied by an increase in c-fos and zif268 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the pontine tegmental area </plain></SENT>
