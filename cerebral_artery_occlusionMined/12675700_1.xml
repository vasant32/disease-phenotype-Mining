<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced in rodents by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is a widely used paradigm of human brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and reproducibility of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> filament occlusion model in rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 rodents (69 rats and 71 mice) were operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five animals were subjected to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; the surgical procedure consisted of introducing an uncoated surgical nylon monofilament into the cervical common carotid artery (CCA) and advancing it intracranially to permanently block blood flow into the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five sham-occluded rodents underwent CCA ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical success, autopsy confirmed success and mortality rate were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effective <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was confirmed by the evidence of motor neurological deficit, by histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IHC was performed in a randomly selected number of animals to detect the protein product of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain tissue in mice was examined by RT-PCR for the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical success rate was 89% in the rats, significantly lower than that in the mice (100%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Autopsy confirmed success rate in the rats, 60%, was also significantly different from that in the mice (92.5%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate was 4.3% in the rats and 15% in the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that the microsurgical filament occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> can be more successfully performed in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lower rate of success in rats seems to be as a result of the architecture of the carotid canal in this animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No previous reports, using a considerable number of animals, have compared the feasibility of intraluminal model in the rat with that in the mouse </plain></SENT>
