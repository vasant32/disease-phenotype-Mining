<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was examined further in transgenic mice constructed with the human APOE3 or APOE4 gene under the control of human promoter and tissue expression elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of human apoE3 and apoE4 proteins in brains of human APOE homozygous transgenic mice was confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
