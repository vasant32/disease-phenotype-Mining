<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The extent to which pharmaceutical and behavioral therapies following central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injury may either deter or encourage the development of compensatory movement patterns is a topic of considerable interest in neurorehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, functional outcome measures alone are relatively insensitive to compensatory changes in movement patterns per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study used both functional outcome measures and kinematic analysis of forelimb movements to examine the effects of human adult bone marrow-derived somatic cells (hABM-SCs) on motor recovery in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Long-Evans black-hooded rats (n = 12) were trained in a forelimb reaching task and then underwent surgical middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, producing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that impaired the trained paw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week poststroke, animals were randomly assigned to either a hABM-SC injection or control injection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reaching behaviors were then compared at baseline and at 10 weeks poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups improved their outcome scores during the 10-week recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the hABM-SC group recovered significantly more function than controls in terms of the number of pellets retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the control group appeared to improve their functional performance by using compensatory strategies that involved an increased number of trajectory adjustments, whereas the hABM-SC group's kinematics more closely resembled prestroke movement patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that kinematic measures established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research on humans are also sensitive to performance differences prestroke versus poststroke in the rat model, reinforcing the utility of this method to evaluate treatments that may ultimately translate to patient populations </plain></SENT>
