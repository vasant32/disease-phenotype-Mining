<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most methods of measuring the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rodents either require expensive equipment or render the brain tissue unusable for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on an inexpensive, tissue-saving method for quantifying the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in small rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24 h of reperfusion in male Wistar rats, the lesion was first identified using MRI with T2-weighted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was then visualized in unfixed brain cryosections using microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2)-immunohistochemistry and silver <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion areas detected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three different methods completely overlapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated for each method from the lesion area size on serial sections and the distance between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in lesion size were found between the individual animals (p = 0.000056), but not between different methods (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAP2 immunohistochemistry is a convenient and valid method to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion volume; in addition 98% of the brain tissue is saved and available for use in further histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
