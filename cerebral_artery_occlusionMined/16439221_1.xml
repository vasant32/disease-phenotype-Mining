<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate how often early computed tomography (CT) signs are associated with blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption and result in haemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial CT findings were prospectively evaluated in 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion who underwent initial CT examination within 3h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and who were treated with intra-arterial reperfusion therapy within 6h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Obscuration of the margin of the lentiform nucleus and loss of the insular ribbon were evaluated as early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical effacement was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was defined as contrast medium staining in post-therapeutic CT just after reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between pre-therapeutic early CT signs and post-therapeutic contrast staining or haemorrhagic transformations was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories was significantly higher than that of cortical effacement (68.9 versus 27.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between pre-therapeutic early CT signs and post-therapeutic contrast staining in both the deep and superficial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, cortical effacement had a significantly higher incidence of post-therapeutic contrast staining (54.8 versus 82.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, cortical effacement tended to develop into haemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories and haemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cortical effacement may be an advanced CT sign with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and potential risk for haemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories may not be a contraindication of reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
