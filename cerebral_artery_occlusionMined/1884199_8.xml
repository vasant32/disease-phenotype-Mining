<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control and infarcted rats showed no difference in locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarcted rats tended to rotate towards the side of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large sensorimotor deficit was found contralateral to the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute values of the side-biases for the rotation and sensorimotor tests were of the same degree irrespective of lesion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas the left hemisphere lesion size did not correlate to the behavioural outcome, the size of the right hemisphere lesion was highly correlated to the total sensorimotor deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the sensorimotor deficit of specific body parts was found to correlate to the damage of certain brain regions in a rostrocaudal fashion, reminiscent of a somatotopical organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of ipsilateral rotation correlated to brain tissue loss at the level of the posterior caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate an asymmetrical organization for brain functions involved in the performance of the rotation and sensorimotor tests </plain></SENT>
