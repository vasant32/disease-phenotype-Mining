<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in rats by inserting a nylon thread into the internal carotid artery for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vivo generation of ROS and its location in the brain were analyzed from the enhanced ESR signal decay data of three intra-arterially injected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35226">spin probes</z:chebi> with different membrane permeabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ESR signal decay of the probe with intermediate permeability was significantly enhanced 30 min after reperfusion following MCAO, whereas no enhancement was observed with the other probes or in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced in vivo signal decay was significantly suppressed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was barely discernible until 3 h of reperfusion, and was clearly suppressed with the probe of intermediate permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> MCI-186 completely suppressed the enhanced in vivo signal decay after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results clearly demonstrate that ROS are generated at the interface of the cerebrovascular cell membrane when reperfusion follows MCAO in rats, and that the ROS generated during the initial stages of transient MCAO cause brain injury </plain></SENT>
