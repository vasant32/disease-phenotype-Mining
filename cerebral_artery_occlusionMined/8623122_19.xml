<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transient decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water as measured by fast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the ischemic border zone are thought to reflect cellular swelling associated with spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were applied to study the characteristics of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and the correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> recovery time and tissue perfusion in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial DWI was performed during remote middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats (n = 5) with an echo-planar imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps were calculated and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values displayed as a function of time in user-defined regions of interest with a time resolution of 12 to 16 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed for qualitative correlation of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes with tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recovery time of transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases correlated with the degree of the perfusion deficit (r = .81, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slowly recovering <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> declines were found close to the ischemic core and correlated with severe perfusion deficit, while short-lasting <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> declines were typically found in moderately malperfused or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases originated in the subcortical and cortical ischemic border zones and propagated along the cortex with a velocity of 2.9 +/- 0.9 mm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The variation in the recovery time of transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases in the ischemic periphery reflects the gradient of the tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severely delayed recovery time after spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is thought to represent the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
