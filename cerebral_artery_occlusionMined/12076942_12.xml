<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study compared cerebral hemodynamics measured using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with the cerebral perfusion reserve obtained using dynamic (133)Xe single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging data were acquired using a multishot echoplanar sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our procedure for quantification of mean transit time was based on the indicator dilution theory and deconvolution analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increased mean transit time values obtained with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging correlated well (r=-0.789, p &lt; 0.0001) with decreased cerebral perfusion reserve determined by performing dynamic (133)Xe SPECT before and after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean transit time values in the regions with severely decreased perfusion reserve were significantly higher than those in the regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or moderately decreased perfusion reserve (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mean transit time images generated from dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging data could be used to evaluate the extent of cerebral perfusion reserve impairment in patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
