<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reduction of cerebral blood flow results in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic disturbances, including a reduction in Na,K-ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between this reduction and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is unknown, as is the effect of restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the role of decreased Na,K-ATPase activity in the pathogenesis and time course of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle cerebral arteries of rats were occluded by cannulation with a nylon suture for 30, 60, 120, or 240 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were then decapitated (permanent occlusion) or the suture was withdrawn to allow 24 hours of reperfusion before decapitation (temporary occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Na,K-ATPase activity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+ and water contents were measured at various intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ischemic hemisphere, Na,K-ATPase activity was significantly decreased at 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes of permanent occlusion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant decrease in rats subjected to 60 or 120 minutes of temporary occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Water content increased after 60, 120, or 240 minutes of permanent occlusion (p less than 0.01); after 24 hours of reperfusion, water content remained elevated (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> content increased after both permanent and temporary occlusion, and the K+ content decreased only after permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increases in water content correlated with decreases in Na,K-ATPase activity after temporary occlusion and with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>:K+ ratio after permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reduction in Na,K-ATPase activity resulting in disruption of cellular ionic homeostasis may account for early development of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is also present 24 hours after 60 and 120 but not 30 minutes of temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
