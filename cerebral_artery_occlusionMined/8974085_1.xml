<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the cerebral protective effects of lacidipine (L) using three different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> models, and the effects were compared with those of nicardipine (N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1) In the transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model of the rat, oral administration of L (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly decreased the number of acidophilic neurons in CA1 regions of the hippocampus 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>N (3 mg/kg, p.o.) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also produced a significant reduction in the number of acidophilic neurons, and it's effectiveness was almost the same as that of L (1 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) In the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model of the rat, oral administration of L (1 and 3 mg/kg) before of after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such an ameliorative effect was also observed when N was administered orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of N at 30 mg/kg was less than that of L at 1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) In the delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model of the dog after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), intravertebral artery injection of L (10 micrograms/kg) or N (10 micrograms/kg) dilated the contracted basilar artery 3 days after SAH to the level before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, while both L and N increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a dose-dependent manner in conscious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat, the increment of CBF induced by L at a given level of <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced-blood pressure</z:mp> was greater than that induced by N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that lacidipine may be a potential therapeutic agent that exerts a protective effect against brain damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
