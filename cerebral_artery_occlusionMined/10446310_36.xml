<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nestin is an intermediate filament protein, transiently and abundantly expressed early in embryogenesis, e.g., in neuroepithelial cells, radial glia, germinal matrix cells and vascular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the adult rat brain, nestin is only present in endothelial and select subventricular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that after an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nestin expression is induced in glial cells and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the temporal profile of nestin expression after induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain from rats (n=24) subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days and 28 days (n=3, per time point) of reperfusion, and control sham operated (n=3) rats were processed for Western blotting to quantify nestin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another set of brains from rats (n=28), subjected to 2 h of MCAo and 6 h, 12 h, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days (n=4, per time point, except n=8 at 2 days) of reperfusion, and control sham operated (n=3) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n=2) rats were processed by single and double labeled immunohistochemistry for cellular identification of nestin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By Western blotting, nestin within ischemic tissue increased slightly as early as 6 h, peaked at 7 days, and expression persisted for at least 4 weeks after 2 h of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, nestin was expressed in astrocytes in the ischemic core from 6 to 12 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nestin immunoreactivity was present in large numbers of astrocytes, and in scattered oligodendroglia and monocytes/macrophages in both the inner and outer boundary zones to the ischemic core at 1-7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nestin expression in glial cells declined at longer durations of survival, although for least 4 weeks after MCAo the nestin immunoreactivity delineated the boundary zone adjacent to the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nestin expression was present in some neurons localized to the outer boundary zone of the ischemic lesion in the cortex and striatum, and in most ependymal cells in the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) from day 2 after MCAo and onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of nestin increased throughout the microvasculature in both the ischemic core and the boundary zone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischemic rats after 12 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nestin immunoreactivity in glial, neuronal and ependymal cells is suggestive of a protein expression pattern found in developing brain </plain></SENT>
