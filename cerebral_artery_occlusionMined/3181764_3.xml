<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduction of blood flow and electroencephalography power were greater and collateral vessel resistance was higher in the aged group than the young group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography power after the occlusion was correlated with collateral resistance and blood flow in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that collateral function deteriorates with aging and the high vulnerability to ischemic insult in aged brain may be caused in part by the poor collateral function </plain></SENT>
