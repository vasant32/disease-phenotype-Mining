<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>17 patients had internal carotid, 17 had middle cerebral, and 4 had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> lasting less than 12 minutes has not been associated with postoperative morbidity, in any case without appreciable change in CCT after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prompt prolongation of CCT was warned the surgeon, but CCT prolongation up to 10 ms could occur without permanent neurological deficit, except in one Grade 4 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>10 of 18 patients who lost the N 20 cortical potential showed postoperative neurological deficit, which was promptly recoverable in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The speed of loss or recovery of N 20 enabled a patients's prognosis to be predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irrecoverable postoperative deficit is unlikely if the N 20 takes longer than 4 minutes to disappear, to reappears within 20 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>
