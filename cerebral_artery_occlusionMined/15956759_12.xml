<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in humans, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment can increase risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health risks associated with hormone replacement have led many women to consider alternative therapies including high-soy diets or supplements containing soy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi>, which act as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor ligands to selectively mimic some of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>'s actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a high-soy diet would share the neuroprotective actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and divided into three groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi>-free diet + placebo (IF-P), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi>-free diet + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (IF-E), or high-soy diet + placebo (S-P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after being placed on diets, rats underwent left permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow were equivalent across groups ( approximately 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later neurological deficit was determined, and brains were collected for assay of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the IF-P rats MCAO produced a 50 +/- 4% cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> and high-soy diet both significantly reduced the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to 26 +/- 5% in IF-E rats and to 37 +/- 5% in S-P rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis at five rostro-caudal levels revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment was slightly more effective at reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size than high soy diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall neurological deficit scores at 24 h correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size; however, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data show that 2 wk of a high-soy diet is an effective prophylactic strategy for reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> size in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
