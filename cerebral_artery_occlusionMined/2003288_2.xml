<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the value of pretreatment with clentiazem (8-chlorodiltiazem), a diltiazem derivative with cerebroselective properties, on the consequences of surgical occlusion of the middle cerebral artery via a transorbital approach in 38 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen rabbits received 1.7 (n = 5), 5 (n = 8), or 15 (n = 6) mg/kg clentiazem orally four times a day for 24 hours before and 48 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon sacrifice, a segment of the right middle cerebral artery distal to the occlusion and a corresponding segment from the nonoccluded left middle cerebral artery were mounted on myographs for in vitro study of their reactivity to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, and electrical stimulation of intramural sympathetic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphometric measurements of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained brain slices permitted us to estimate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 1.7, 5, and 15 mg/kg clentiazem significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the 15 mg/kg-treated group was only 4% that of the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in any treated group compared with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 36% in the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean values for vascular smooth muscle contractility to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> and relaxation to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> were significantly enhanced in vessels from treated rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that pretreatment with clentiazem offers cerebral protection and significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as arterial wall damage beyond the occlusion </plain></SENT>
