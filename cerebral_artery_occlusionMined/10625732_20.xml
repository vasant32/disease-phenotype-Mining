<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to be significantly smaller than those in male SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is responsible for the sex difference in ischemic vulnerability in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In experiment 1, 1 week (short-term) or 4 weeks (long-term) after the ovariectomy (OVX), female SHR (5 months old) were randomly subjected to photothrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, the rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups (ie, the sham-ovariectomized, ovariectomized, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the replacement group, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31011">valerate</z:chebi> (200 microgram/kg) was subcutaneously injected once a week after the OVX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after the OVX or sham-OVX, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in regional cerebral blood flow were determined by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In experiment 1, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume produced 1 week after the OVX was not different from that of the sham-ovariectomized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume produced 4 weeks after the OVX was significantly larger than that of the sham-ovariectomized group (82.4+/-11.6 versus 54.5+/-16.0 mm(3), P=0.0058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement after the OVX was observed to attenuate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with the ovariectomized group (55.6+/-18.8 versus 78.5+/-21.0 mm(3), P=0.0321) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degrees of regional cerebral blood flow reduction did not differ among the sham-ovariectomized, ovariectomized, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was thus found to increase the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, which was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> contributes to the sex difference in ischemic vulnerability and that endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> also has a neuroprotective effect against ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
