<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that a high soy diet significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the hypothesis that a high soy diet would attenuate programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and fed either an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi>-reduced diet (IFP) or a high soy diet (SP) for 2 weeks before undergoing 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) followed by 22.5 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size, as assessed by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, was significantly reduced by a high soy diet (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic cortex, measured by TUNEL staining, was significantly reduced by the high soy diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of active caspase-3 positive cells and caspase-mediated alpha-spectrin cleavage were also significantly decreased in the ischemic cortex of SP rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, nuclear translocation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor (AIF) was significantly reduced in the ischemic cortex of SP rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Soy significantly increased bcl-x(L) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in the ischemic cortex compared with IFP rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed increased neuronal expression of bcl-2 and bcl-x(L) in the ischemic cortex of both IFP and SP rats following tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a high soy diet decreases both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, a high soy diet enhances expression of the cell survival factor bcl-x(L) following tMCAO, contributing to the neuroprotective effects of soy in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
