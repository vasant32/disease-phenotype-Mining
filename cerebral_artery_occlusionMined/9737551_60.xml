<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a known endothelial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> and a potent enhancer of vascular permeability although its role in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is still not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present report describes the immunohistochemical distribution of VEGF and its 2 receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1 at day 1 and 3 following permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bilateral increase in VEGF immunoreactivity, particularly in neurons and blood vessels, was seen in both the experimental designs by day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By day 3, the immunoreactivity was restricted chiefly to the lesion side, where reaction was most prominent in the border zones of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreaction to VEGF was more pronounced in cases of permanent MCAO than in transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flt-1 reaction was increased in neurons, glial and endothelial cells after both transient and permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity to Flk-1 was prominent in glial cells and was present to some extent in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate an early upregulation of VEGF and its receptors after permanent as well as transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
