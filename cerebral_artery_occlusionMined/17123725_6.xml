<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using diffusion and perfusion imaging, we compared the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in Sprague-Dawley rats after permanent MCAO (pMCAO) with different types of sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to pMCAO produced with either 4-0 silicone coated (n=8), or 3-0 uncoated monofilaments (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial determination of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps were performed up to 3 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were calculated by using previously validated thresholds and correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> defined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>/CBF-defined mismatch volume in the 4-0 coated suture model was present significantly longer (up to 120 min) compared to the uncoated 3-0 suture model (30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TTC-derived <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly larger in the coated model (290.3+/-32.8 mm(3)) relative to the uncoated model (252.3+/-34.6 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the type of suture may significantly influence the spatiotemporal evolution of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>/CBF-mismatch as well as the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These inter-model variations must be taken into account when assessing new therapeutic approaches on ischemic lesion evolution in the rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
