<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in symptomatic patients with hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and determine the efficacy of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass in restoring neuropsychologic integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients were defined by clinical and neuroradiological criteria as suffering from hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> because of unilateral ICA or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent assessment of cerebral blood flow and metabolism using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) before and after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To provide data regarding cognition, changes in the Japanese Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative study of patients revealed significant impairment in cerebral blood flow and metabolism as well as reduced WAIS-R score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the factors considered, only elevated regional oxygen extraction fraction and reduced regional cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen were significantly associated with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0255, respectively; logistic regression analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After bypass surgery, cerebral blood flow and metabolism improved significantly, and the WAIS-R score increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic patients with hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> displayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> that was partially alleviated with EC-IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
