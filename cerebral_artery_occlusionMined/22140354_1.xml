<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings of a persistent post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decline in NMDAR density, which plays a pivotal role in plasticity and memory formation, suggest that NMDAR stimulation, rather than inhibition, may prove beneficial in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> period after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHODS: Rats (n = 36) that were subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were given a single injection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) 24 h after occlusion and followed up for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI (structural and functional) was used to measure infarction, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and cortical activation due to electrical forepaw stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Memory function was assessed on days 7, 21 and 30 postocclusion using the novel object recognition test </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> treatment resulted in significant improvement of somatosensory and cognitive function relative to vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By day 30, cognitive performance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>-treated animals was indistinguishable from nonischemic controls, while vehicle-treated animals demonstrated a stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> had no significant effect on infarction or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support a beneficial role for NMDAR stimulation during the recovery period after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, most likely due to enhanced neuroplasticity rather than neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
