<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of B cells to the development of MCAO by comparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and functional outcomes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) versus B-cell-deficient μMT(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results clearly demonstrate larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, higher mortality, more severe functional deficits, and increased numbers of activated T cells, macrophages, microglial cells, and neutrophils in the affected brain hemisphere of MCAO-treated μMT(-/-) versus WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These MCAO-induced changes were completely prevented in B-cell-restored μMT(-/-) mice after transfer of highly purified WT GFP(+) B cells that were detected in the periphery, but not the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, transfer of B cells from IL-10(-/-) mice had no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when transferred into μMT(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support a previously unrecognized activity of IL-10-secreting WT B cells to limit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, mortality rate, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and functional neurological deficits 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our novel observations are the first to implicate IL-10-secreting B cells as a major regulatory cell type in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and suggest that enhancement of regulatory B cells might have application as a novel therapy for this devastating neurologic condition </plain></SENT>
