<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The poor quality of life after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is largely attributed to deficits in cognitive-motor functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to detect if damaged motor learning function were attributed to motor deficits in rats following a transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by a 2-h occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor functions were evaluated from 5 up to 28 days after reperfusion in ischemic and control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor function was detected by a series of motor tests (runway traversing and beam balancing, as well as foot fault placing, parallel bar crossing, rope and ladder climbing), and motor learning behavior was determined by analyzing the rate of improvement of impaired function during performance of the motor tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant (P&lt;0.001) motor deficits were detected in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group (n=10) while performing motor tasks that involve extensive coordination, in comparison to the controls (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although motor behavior was improved with repeated behavior testing, unparalleled rate of improvement of motor performance on rope and ladder climbing tests was found between the two groups, suggesting an impaired motor learning function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue damage was detected in the ischemic animals 28 days after surgery, demonstrated by 40% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both motor learning and motor function were impaired in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The motor tests used in this study are sensitive, semi-quantitative, and reproducible measurements of functional impairment in rats following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
