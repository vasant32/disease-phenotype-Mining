<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recently developed technique of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging utilizes radiofrequency (RF) radiation in the presence of a strong magnetic field to provide cross sectional displays of body <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> similar to computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When utilizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, the operator alters tissue contrast electronically by changing RF pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three most frequently used RF pulse sequences are partial-saturation (PS), inversion-recovery (IR), and spin-echo (SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the sensitivity of these RF sequences to detect ischemic changes in our primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans were carried out using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three pulse formats 5 to 60 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in four animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SE- and IR-sequenced proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images readily identified areas of evolving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 5 to 60 hours after MCAO, whereas PS scans that were performed during this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 24 to 60 hours after MCAO, PS-sequenced scans showed focal areas of progressively decreasing signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, SE and IR scans performed at the same intervals always demonstrated more extensive tissue changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, the effects of altering RF pulse sequences, and the resulting interpretation of changes observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sections are presented </plain></SENT>
