<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to directly compare the benefit of reperfusion with that of craniectomy and to study the effects of combined treatment in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was introduced in 28 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four groups were investigated: (1) no treatment, (2) decompressive craniectomy, (3) reperfusion, and (4) reperfusion and craniectomy as treatment at 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI were performed serially from 0.5 to 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 6-hour DWI-derived hemispheric lesion volumes in the reperfusion group (10.2+/-3.9%), the craniectomy group (23.0+/-6.4%), and the combination group (21.8+/-12.4) were significantly smaller than that in the control group (44.1+/-5.4%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion, craniectomy, and combined treatment led to higher perfusion in the cortex compared with the control group, whereas only reperfused animals achieved significantly higher perfusion in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 animals, combined reperfusion and decompressive craniectomy resulted in an early contrast media enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early reperfusion and craniectomy were shown to be effective in decreasing infarction volume by improving cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion remains the best therapy in malignant hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment yields no additional benefit compared with single treatment, probably because of early blood-brain barrier breakdown </plain></SENT>
