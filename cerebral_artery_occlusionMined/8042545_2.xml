<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to study the haemodynamic and metabolic changes following bypass surgery, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), the oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), and the cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were measured using a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomograph (PET) on 13 patients who had unilateral internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two subgroups according to pre-operative rOEF values from the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> side: the misery perfusion group, which had high rOEF values (&gt; or = 0.56), and the coupling perfusion group, which had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rOEF values (0.38-0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A post-operative PET study was performed 1-2 months and/or 1-5 years following the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the misery perfusion cases showed a post-operative CBF increase, where an accompanying OEF decreased to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, indicating an attenuated misery perfusion state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CMRO2 values, however, remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 7 coupling perfusion cases had an ipsilateral CBF increase in the earlier PET study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that misery perfusion is attenuated following bypass surgery, although the procedure does not consistently improve oxygen metabolism </plain></SENT>
