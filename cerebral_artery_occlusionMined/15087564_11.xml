<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Collateral flow plays an important role in maintaining tissue viability in proximal large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed and tested a regional angiographic collateral grading system for patients with angiographically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to predict regional infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A subset of 42 patients was selected from 180 patients enrolled in the Prolyse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> II (PROACT II) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Readers evaluated baseline cerebral angiograms in a blinded fashion for the degree of regional collateral circulation, which was graded on a 4-point scale in each of 15 anatomic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional and total collateral flow scores were compared with the presence or absence of infarction on 7- to 10-day follow-up computed tomography (CT), as well as clinical outcome as assessed by National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The collateral flow score on baseline angiography accurately predicted infarction, demonstrating a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral grades on baseline angiography correlated moderately with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on follow-up CT scan at 7 to 10 days (R=0.61; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collateral grades also correlated with follow-up NIHSS scores for patients who received thrombolysis (R=0.36 to 0.49, P&lt;0.05), but not for control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An angiographic grading system for regional collateral flow accurately predicts the extent and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study corroborates the correlation between the presence of collateral flow, infarction volume, and clinical outcome, and it reinforces the need to control for collateral flow in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
