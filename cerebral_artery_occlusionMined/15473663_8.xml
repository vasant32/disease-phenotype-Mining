<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of wogonin in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wogonin markedly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 22 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wogonin decreased the production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 in lipopolisaccharide-stimulated microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While wogonin reduced the activity of NF-kappaB, it did not change the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases family members, p38, ERK and JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lipopolisaccharide-stimulated production of NO and cytokines was significantly blocked by various kinds of NF-kappaB inhibitors such as N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and MG-132 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data may indicate that wogonin has neuroprotective effect by preventing the overactivation of microglial cells, possibly by inactivating NF-kappaB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
