<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an enzyme kinetic analysis, FR247304 exhibits potent and competitive inhibition of PARP-1 activity, with a K(i) value of 35 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that prevention of PARP activation by FR247304 treatment protects against both reactive oxygen species-induced PC12 cell injury in vitro and ischemic brain injury in vivo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas other PARP inhibitors such as 3-aminobenzamide and PJ34 [N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylactamide] showed similar neuroprotective actions, they were less potent in in vitro assays and less efficacious in an in vivo model compared with FR247304 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the novel PARP-1 inhibitor FR247304 exerts its neuroprotective efficacy in in vitro and in vivo experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> via potent PARP-1 inhibition and also suggest that FR247304 or its derivatives could be attractive therapeutic candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
