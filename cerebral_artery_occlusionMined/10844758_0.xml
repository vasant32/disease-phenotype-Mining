<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Either U74389G or vehicle only was administered one hour before and 2 h after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dialysate was analysed for on-line pH, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In aminosteroid treated animals the levels of ascorbic and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acids</z:chebi> were lower in dialysates after occlusion, total release of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was significantly reduced and on-line pH was significantly higher than in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume at 4 h, which was significantly reduced in treated animals, correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> release and on-line pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that neuroprotective effects of aminosteroids might be explained by: (a) preservation of intracellular levels of the radical scavenger <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> with possible concomitant reduction of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release; and (b) reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> release and increased pH which might influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> positively </plain></SENT>
