<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules-1 (ICAM-1) and CD11/CD18 integrins have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion induced neutrophil endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and transmigration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the roles of CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and ICAM-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury by using monoclonal antibodies, WT1 (anti-CD11a), WT3 (anti-CD18), and 1A29 (anti-ICAM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 1 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual antibodies were administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally at 15 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 24 h after reperfusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, neutrophil infiltration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained enhancement of ICAM-1 expression on capillaries was observed up to 24 h (beginning between 1 and 3 h after reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While, leukocytes began to infiltrate into the ischemic hemisphere between 6 and 12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with individual antibodies against cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in addition to neutrophil accumulation 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results strongly implicate the invasion of neutrophils in the development of post-ischemic brain injury, and suggest that interactions between CD11a/CD18 and ICAM-1 contribute to neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
