<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to explore the association between the timing of recanalization and HT risk in patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) &lt;3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and to investigate the relationship between HT subtypes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion treated with rtPA &lt;3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial transcranial Doppler examinations were performed on admission and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presence and type of HT were assessed on CT at 36 to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin scale was used to assess outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early and delayed recanalization was identified in 17 patients (53.1%) and 8 patients (25%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HT was detected in 14 patients (43.7%): 4 (12.5%) with hemorrhagic infarction (HI1), 5 (15.6%) with HI2, 3 (9.3%) with parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (PH1), and 2 (6.8%) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29938,29942">PH2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distribution of HT subtypes differed significantly (P=0.025), depending on the time to artery reopening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight of 9 (89%), 1 of 5 (20%), and 8 of 18 (44.4%) with HI1-HI2, with PH1-<z:chebi fb="16" ids="29935,29939">PH2</z:chebi>, and without HT, respectively, recanalized in &lt;6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Delayed recanalization was observed in 1 patient with HI1-HI2 (11%), 4 with PH1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29938,29942">PH2 </z:chebi>(80%), and 3 without HT (16.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement was significantly (P&lt;0.001) more frequent in patients with HI1-HI2 (88%) than in those without HT (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly (P&lt;0.031) lower in patients with HI1-HI2 (51.4+/-42 cm3) than in patients with PH1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29938,29942">PH2 </z:chebi>(83.8+/-48 cm3) and those without HT (98.4+/-84 cm3, P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin scale score was significantly lower in HI1-HI2 compared with PH1-<z:chebi fb="16" ids="29935,29939">PH2</z:chebi> patients (1.9+/-1.1 versus 4.6+/-1.2, P&lt;0.001) and with those without HT (1.9+/-1.1 versus 3.5+/-2.0, P=0.009.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolysis-related HI (HI1-HI2) represents a marker of early successful recanalization, which leads to a reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
