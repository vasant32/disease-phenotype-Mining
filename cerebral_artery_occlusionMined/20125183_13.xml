<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by intravenous administration of phosphate-buffered saline or BMSCs 1 day later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adhesive-removal test and modified neurologic severity score were performed weekly to monitor limb functional deficit and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anterograde tracing with biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> injected into the right motor cortex was used to assess axonal sprouting in the contralateral motor cortex and ipsilateral rostral forelimb area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressive functional recovery was significantly enhanced by BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, axonal density in both contralateral motor cortex and ipsilateral rostral forelimb area significantly increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stromal cells markedly enhanced such interhemispheric and intracortical connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, labeled transcallosal axons in the corpus callosum were not altered with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both interhemispheric and intracortical axonal sprouting were significantly and highly correlated with behavioral outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cortical neurons surviving in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> motor cortex undergo axonal sprouting to restore connections between different cerebral areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stromal cells enhance axonal plasticity, which may underlie neurologic functional improvement </plain></SENT>
