<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the relationship between neuronal cell transplantation and endogenous neurogenesis after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found previously that transplantation of neuronal precursors derived from BG01 human embryonic stem cells reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved behavioral outcome after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, transplantation was performed 14 days after distal MCAO and doublecortin (Dcx)-expressing cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone of dentate gyrus (SGZ) were counted 60 days post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation increased neurogenesis (Dcx expression) in ipsilateral SVZ, but not in contralateral SVZ or either SGZ, in both young adult (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cell-based therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be associated with changes in endogenous adaptive processes, including neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
