<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have indicated that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have the potential to improve neurological function when transplanted into animal models of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still undetermined how the BMSCs should be transplanted to obtain the most efficient therapeutic benefits safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether a thermoreversible gelation polymer (TGP) hydrogel acts as a noninvasive, valuable scaffold in BMSC transplantation for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle, BMSC suspension, or the BMSC-TGP construct was transplanted onto the ipsilateral intact neocortex at 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms were assessed throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fate of the transplanted BMSC was examined 8 weeks after transplantation with immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TGP hydrogel completely disappeared and provoked no <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the host brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many transplanted cells were widely engrafted in the ipsilateral cerebrum, including the dorsal neocortex adjacent to the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the BMSC-TGP construct-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their number was significantly larger than in the BMSC-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority were positive for both NeuN and MAP2 and morphologically simulated the neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that surgical transplantation of tissue-engineered BMSCs onto the intact neocortex enhances the engraftment of donor cells around the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data may be useful in developing a noninvasive but efficient paradigm in neural tissue engineering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TGP hydrogel can be a promising candidate for valuable scaffolds in BMSC transplantation for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders because of its unique biochemical properties </plain></SENT>
