<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some additional roles of PlGF in other tissues have recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relatively little is known about PlGF expression in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and the involvement of PlGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of PlGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, utilizing a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PlGF expression and release from brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in response to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) were examined in primary culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the effects of PlGF in cerebral ischemic injury, we investigated the effects of varying concentrations of PlGF upon neurons in an in vitro model of OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of PlGF upon neuronal vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected PlGF immunoreactivity mainly in the microvessels and interstitum of rat brain cortex after cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary BMECs, PlGF expression and release were significantly higher under OGD conditions in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, PlGF administration reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in an in vitro model of OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were expressed in primary cortical neurons as measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VEGFR-2 expression in primary neurons was significantly higher following PlGF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that VEGFR-2 signaling may play a role in PlGF-mediated neuroprotection, and that PlGF may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
