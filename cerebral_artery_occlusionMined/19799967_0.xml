<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But the mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As cell cycle machinery plays an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the dynamic changes of cell cycle elements in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found the cell cycle markers, cdk4 along with its activator cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRb, on ser-795), the cyclin D/cdk4 complex mutual target, was upregulated accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, intravenously administrated BMSCs facilitated cyclin D1, cdk4, and PCNA decrease in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, phospho-pRb (ser-795) was completely inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, endogenous cdk inhibitor p27 reduced before but enhanced after BMSCs treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested BMSCs might modulate cell cycle progression in injured brain via downregulation of the cyclin D1/cdk4/pRb pathway as well as upregulation of p27 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide another way by which BMSCs may contribute to the recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
