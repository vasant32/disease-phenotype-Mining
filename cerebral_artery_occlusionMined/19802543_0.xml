<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats: with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were established with the modified suture method, and they were randomly divided into the following groups: the sham-operated group, the model group, the Nimodipine group (0.012 g/kg), the NDS group (1.075 g/kg), the total extracts group (0.23 g/kg), the high-dose NEC group (0.07 g/kg), the middle-dose NEC group (0.02 g/kg), and the low-dose NEC group (0.007 g/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aforesaid medicines were administered at the 2nd, 4th, and 24th h after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the infarction size and water content in the brain were evaluated at the 26th h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, after oral administration once daily for 7 successive days, the changes in the degree of neurological deficit, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were measured on the 7th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NEC could significantly reduce the infarction size after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and slightly relieve water content in the brain, significantly alleviate neurological function impairment, increase the levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> enzyme (ATPase) activity, and decrease the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NEC could also extenuate Bax and caspase-3 expression in the hippocampus tissue of the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared with the three NEC treated groups, the high-dose NEC showed better efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NEC could significantly reduce brain injury induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>;: its mechanism was closely associated with hindering <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effective composite-guided methodology is a feasible tool to improve the neuro-protective properties of the Chinese medicine guided prescription NDS against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
