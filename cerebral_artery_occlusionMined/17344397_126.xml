<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using transgenic mice expressing a mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus driven by myeloid-specific CD11b promoter and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> treatment as a tool, we selectively ablated proliferating (Mac-2 positive) microglia after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The series of experiments using green fluorescent protein-chimeric mice demonstrated that within the first 72 h after ischemic injury, the Mac-2 marker [unlike Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1)] was preferentially expressed by the resident microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective ablation of proliferating resident microglia was associated with a marked alteration in the temporal dynamics of proinflammatory cytokine expression, a significant increase in the size of infarction associated with a 2.7-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells, predominantly neurons, and a 1.8-fold decrease in the levels of IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A double-immunofluorescence analysis revealed a approximately 100% colocalization between IGF-1 positive cells and Mac-2, a marker of activated/proliferating resident microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, stimulation of microglial proliferation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in IGF-1 levels and a significant increase of Mac2+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that a postischemic proliferation of the resident microglial cells may serve as an important modulator of a brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More importantly, our results revealed a marked neuroprotective potential of proliferating microglia serving as an endogenous pool of neurotrophic molecules such as IGF-1, which may open new therapeutic avenues in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
