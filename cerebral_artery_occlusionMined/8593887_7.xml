<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fine structure of cells in the penumbra region of the necrotic center was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distal occlusion resulted in ischemic lesion of the frontoparietal cortex of variable extent; NDP induction was detected in neurons, astrocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, with regional specificity and a temporal gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One, two, and seven days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, weak NDP positivity was consistently induced in some pyramidal neurons in cortical areas neighboring the necrotic area; NDP induction was also seen in pyramidal neurons of the ipsilateral anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortices and in the tenia tecta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, numerous NDP-positive pyramidal neurons were detected in the contralateral frontoparietal cortex after relatively large ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, NDP induction in neurons was only evident in the deep cortical layers near the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NDP histochemistry combined with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunofluorescence, performed 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, indicated that the astrocytes at the periphery of the necrotic area were hypertrophic and some of them were also NDP-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One and two days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, numerous macrophages displaying NDP positivity of variable intensity were seen at the periphery of the necrotic area and in the external capsule of the ischemic cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many endothelial cells in the cortex and subcortical white matter were consistently NDP-positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic studies indicated that the area adjacent to the necrotic center was composed of fibrous astrocytes, with the morphological characteristics of proliferation, and numerous lysosome-filled macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether the present results suggest that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may induce in different cell types nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, which is equivalent to NDP in fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The induction of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase may be related to (1) blood-flow regulation at relatively early postischemic stages, which may decline when collateral circulation is established, and/or (2) cytotoxic or neuroprotective mechanisms </plain></SENT>
