<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was designed to develop a simple, reversible primate middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MCAO was achieved by inserting a specially designed intraluminal balloon catheter from the external carotid artery, then to the internal carotid artery, and finally into the proximal segment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using 13 adolescent monkeys (Macaca mulatta) weighing 4.25 +/- 0.23 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infarction was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3, 7, and 23 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local cerebral blood flow in the caudate nucleus decreased remarkably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-MCAO electroencephalographic monitoring showed the inhibition of electroencephalography with slow waves distinctly increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic evaluation demonstrated persistent deficits in the ischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic examinations were consistent with the neurologic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggested that this reversible monkey model resembled a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and should offer a reasonable alternative to craniotomy and the extrinsic ligation of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the laboratory investigation of focal reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
