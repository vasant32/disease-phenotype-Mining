<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue pH was imaged by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27510">umbelliferone</z:chebi> fluorescence and correlated with cerebral blood flow, ATP content, and recordings of the steady potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circumscribed foci of allalosis (pH 7.32+/-0.11) were detected with increasing frequency in penumbral regions having near-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATP concentrations and cerebral blood flow values between 20% and 40% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, defined by ATP loss and cerebral blood flow values of less than 20% of control, and the inner peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim were consistently acidic (pH 6.03+/-0.36 and 6.53+/-0.24, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> dizocilpine (MK-801) suppressed negative shifts of the steady potential and reduced significantly the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> observed in 90% of untreated but only in 44% of treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Penumbral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> appeared to be a time-dependent event occurring 30 to 60 minutes after the passage of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diversity of penumbral pH changes reflects the local disturbance of pH regulation and, possibly, the differential fate of penumbral subareas </plain></SENT>
