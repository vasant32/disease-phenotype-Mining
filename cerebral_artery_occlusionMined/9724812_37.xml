<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are considered major drug candidates for neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> failed clinical trials because of unacceptable side effects and short therapeutic time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> derived from the quinoxalinedione scaffold cannot be used in humans because of their insolubility and resulting renal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, achieving water solubility of quinoxalinediones without loss of selectivity and potency profiles becomes a major challenge for medicinal chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the major tenets in the chemistry of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> is that the incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16215,26066">phosphonate</z:chebi> into the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> framework results in preferential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16215,26066">phosphonate</z:chebi> derivatives of quinoxalinediones was not pursued because of a predicted loss of their selectivity toward AMPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that introduction of a methylphosphonate group into the quinoxalinedione skeleton leaves potency as AMPA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and selectivity for the AMPA receptor unchanged and dramatically improves solubility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One such novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16215,26066">phosphonate</z:chebi> quinoxalinedione derivative and competitive AMPA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ZK200775 exhibited a surprisingly long therapeutic time window of &gt;4 h after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats and was devoid of renal toxicity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16215,26066">phosphonate</z:chebi> quinoxalinedione-based AMPA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may offer new prospects for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and trauma in humans </plain></SENT>
