<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Psychological stress</z:e> causes an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the brain and is able to exacerbate brain damage caused by experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> immobilization stress in mice worsens <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome through mechanisms that involve inflammatory mechanisms, such as accumulation of oxidative/nitrosative mediators and expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> could be regulated by innate immunity, the activation of which takes place in the brain and produces an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we described the implications of TLR4 in ischemic injury, but the role of TLR4 in stress has not yet been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> produced by immobilization stress differs in mice that lack a functional TLR4 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used an experimental paradigm consisting of the exposure of mice to repeated immobilization sessions (1 hour daily for 7 days) before permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that TLR4-deficient mice subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stress had a better behavioral condition compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (C3H/HeN) and that this effect was associated with a minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (malondialdehyde levels) in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous exposure to stress was followed by a smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in TLR4-deficient mice than in mice that express TLR4 normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that TLR4 is involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stress and its exacerbating effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data implicate the effects of innate immunity on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and damage in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
