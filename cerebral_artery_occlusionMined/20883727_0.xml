<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dietary strategies aimed at increasing post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes are lifestyle alterations which could be easily implemented by people at risk of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soy diets have been demonstrated to provide some benefits in the short term following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but longer time periods have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, carefully defined diets containing soy protein isolates have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, male Long Evans Hooded rats were fed semi-purified diets containing either <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> caseinate or soy protein isolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were trained to perform the skilled forelimb reaching task and subsequently underwent unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induce a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, rats remained on the same diet and were tested daily for a period of 8 weeks to observe their performance on the skilled forelimb reaching task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first week following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, rats receiving the soy protein-containing diet (SP) demonstrated less severe reaching deficits than rats fed the Na caseinate-containing diet (CAS) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a soy protein-based diet provides significant protection from neurological damage following MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
