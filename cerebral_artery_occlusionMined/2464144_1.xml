<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During volume expansion, local CBF in the ischaemic hemisphere increased from 25 +/- 12 to 39 +/- 23 cc/100 g/min (p less than 0.01) and during exsanguination decreased to 32 +/- 18 cc/100 g/min </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG power data, as assessed by PRI [(delta + theta power/alpha + beta power) x 100] changed significantly during blood volume manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean PRI value in the right hemisphere deteriorated by increasing from 65 +/- 22 to 94 +/- 25 (p less than 0.01) following vessel occlusion but improved by decreasing to 81 +/- 23 (p less than 0.05) following volume expansion </plain></SENT>
