<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To test the neuroprotective effects of the Chinese medicine Nao-Shuang-Tong on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and to explore the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 115 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R), and I/R plus NST 0.25, NST 0.5 and NST 1 (n=23 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by 1.5h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was measured by tetrazolium staining at 24h following reperfusion, and neurological functional deficits were assessed at 1, 3, 7 and 14 d after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was studied by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation assay at 1 and 3d after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 and Bax/Bcl-2 levels were analyzed by western blot 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NST (0.5 and 1g/kg) significantly reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, attenuated neurological functional deficits, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003204'>reduced neuronal apoptosis</z:mp> in ischemic cortex and in the CA1 region of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NST also suppressed overexpression of Bax and activated caspases-3, -8 and -9, and also inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression and markedly depressed the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that NST is neuroprotective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and is likely to act via inhibition of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> associated with changes in levels of caspases-3 and -8, Bax and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
