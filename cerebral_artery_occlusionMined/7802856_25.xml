<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution perfusion images revealed a core of absent perfusion surrounded by a zone of slow, but measurable perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only the core of severest perfusion deficit demonstrated restricted water diffusion as early as 1 hr, consistent with "cytotoxic" cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the most vulnerable region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours, the area of restricted diffusion encompassed the entire region destined to become infarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spin-echo images, hypointensity, likely reflecting deoxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, was visible in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> accumulated over 72 hr primarily in the surrounding slowly perfused rim, consistent with the concept of "vasogenic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that multimodal MRI can visualize events which define the ischemic penumbra--deoxygenation, maintenance of transmembrane ionic gradients, reduced flow, and delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experiments noninvasively visualized differential hemodynamic and biochemical processes within the core and perifocal penumbra and will allow quantitation over time of the relationship between blood flow, cytotoxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
