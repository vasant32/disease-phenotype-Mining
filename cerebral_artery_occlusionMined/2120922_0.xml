<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, there was a reduction in the mean amplitude of the major cortical wave (MCW) to less than 50% of the pre-occlusion value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant improvement in this amplitude after clip release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was detected in eight of the animals and the mean (+/- s.d.) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was 27.8 +/- 19.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good negative correlation between the MCW amplitude and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was apparent as early as 15 min into the period of occlusion (r = -0.87, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, the 15-min MCW amplitude is a good predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
