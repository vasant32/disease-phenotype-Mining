<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prevents neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through the activation of Akt and its downstream targets Bad and FKHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> modulates the survival pathway through other downstream targets of Akt, including mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) and p70S6 kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that mTOR is a downstream target of Akt and a central regulator of protein synthesis, cell growth, and cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were ovariectomied and treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24h after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the number of positive cells for TUNEL staining in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain injury-induced a decrease in phospho-mTOR and phospho-p70S6 kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decrease in Akt activation and phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6 kinases, and the subsequent decrease in S6 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> plays a potent protective role against brain injury by preventing the injury-induced decrease of mTOR and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
