<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plasmin is a direct-acting thrombolytic agent with a striking hemostatic safety advantage over plasminogen activators in animal models of thrombolysis and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contradistinction to plasminogen activators, which risk <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at any effective thrombolytic dose, plasmin is tolerated without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at several-fold higher amounts than those needed for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasmin has been safe in a current trial in patients with peripheral arterial or graft occlusion, and efforts are now directed toward therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rabbit (4 kg body weight) model of 2-hour, thrombin-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using angiographic documentation of vascular patency and recanalization was used to perform a dose-ranging study of plasmin, delivered by catheter over a median duration of 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasmin induced early recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals (3 per group) within 10 minutes after discontinuation of 3, 2, or 1 mg of agent infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control saline infusion failed to induce recanalization in 3 of 3 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasmin rapidly induces middle cerebral artery recanalization, as determined in an angiogram-based animal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these data and other information, a phase I/IIa clinical trial of plasmin in human middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has been initiated </plain></SENT>
