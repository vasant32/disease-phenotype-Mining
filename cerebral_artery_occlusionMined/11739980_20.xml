<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between arterial recanalization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and outcome in patients treated with intravenous thrombolytics remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to determine the time course of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-induced recanalization in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated &lt;3 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and to investigate the relationship between arterial recanalization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 72 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery territory: 24 treated with rtPA at &lt;3 hours and 48 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial transcranial Doppler examinations were performed on admission and at 6,12, 24, and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by use of CT at day 5 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale score was used to assess outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rate of 6-hour recanalization was higher (P&lt;0.001) in the rtPA group (66%) than in the control group (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (20.8%) rtPA patients and 15 (31.2%) controls recanalized between 6 and 12 hours, and 2 (8.3%) patients and 12 (25%) controls between 12 and 48 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours, 75% of rtPA patients and 27% of controls had improved (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was 50.2+/-40.3 cm(3) in rtPA patients and 124.8+/-81.6 cm(3) in controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was associated strongly (P&lt;0.001) with duration of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 14 (58%) rtPA patients and 11 (23%) controls (P=0.037) became functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score &lt;/=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A close relationship (P=0.002) existed between modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months and time to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinical outcome was associated strongly (P=0.001) with degree of 6-hour recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;17 (odds ratio 12.1, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 68, P=0.001) and early recanalization (odds ratio 23.4, 95% confidence interval 5.4 to 96, P=0.001) as independent predictors of functional independence at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous rtPA is associated with early recanalization, which leads to lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and better clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization is a powerful independent predictor of functional independence at 3 months </plain></SENT>
