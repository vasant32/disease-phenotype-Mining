<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AIMS: We have isolated human neuronal stem cells from exfoliated third molars (wisdom teeth) using a simple and efficient method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cultured neuronal stem cells (designated tNSC) expressed embryonic and adult stem cell markers, markers for chemotatic factor and its corresponding ligand, as well as neuron proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tNSC expressed genes of Nurr1, NF-M and nestin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were used to treat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) surgery-inflicted Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to assess their therapeutic potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For each tNSC cell line, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human impacted wisdom tooth was collected from a donor with consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tooth was cleaned thoroughly with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molar was vigorously shaken or vortexed for 30 min in a 50-mL conical tube with 15-20mL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mixture of dental pulp was collected by centrifugation and cultured in a 25-cm(2) tissue culture flask with 4-5mL Medium 199 supplemented with 5-10% fetal calf serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tNSC harvested from tissue culture, at a concentration of 1-2x10(5), were suspended in 3 microL saline solution and injected into the right dorsolateral striatum of experimental animals inflicted with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Behavioral measurements of the tNSC-treated SD rats showed a significant recovery from neurologic dysfunction after MCAO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a sham group of SD rats failed to recover from the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry analysis of brain sections of the tNSC-treated SD rats showed survival of the transplanted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adult neuronal stem cells may be procured from third molars, and tNSC thus cultivated have potential for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-inflicted rats </plain></SENT>
