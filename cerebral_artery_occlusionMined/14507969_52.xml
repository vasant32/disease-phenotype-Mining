<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> aromatized from precursor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> via the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> aromatase contributes to ischemic neuroprotection in the female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female homozygous aromatase knock-out (ArKO) mice and randomly cycling, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) female littermates were treated with reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (90 min; 22 hr reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total and regional ischemic damage was greater in female ArKOs (total, 33.5 +/- 4.8%; cortical, 47.4 +/- 5.7%; striatal, 44.8 +/- 7.8%) compared with WT (total, 14.2 +/- 5%; cortical, 14.2 +/- 4.5%; striatal, 17.5 +/- 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood pressure and intra-ischemic cortical perfusion were comparable in knock-outs and WT, suggesting that vascular factors do not explain ArKO ischemic sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injury was smaller in ovariectomized WT than in ArKO, emphasizing that extragonadal local <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> plays a critical role in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar increases in cortical and striatal damage were observed in female WT mice chronically treated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitor</z:chebi> fadrozole compared with vehicle-treated control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Restoration of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> to physiological levels completely reversed the ArKO female's susceptibility to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the biosynthetic enzyme P450 aromatase is key to endogenous neuroprotection in females and suggest that enhancing local, nongonadal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> formation could have therapeutic implications is ischemic neuropathology </plain></SENT>
