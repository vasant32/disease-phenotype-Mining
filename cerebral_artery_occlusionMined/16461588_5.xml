<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously documented the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> orthovanadate (SOV) against in rodents i.v. injected with 2 ml/kg 50 mM SOV just after the induction of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; 0 min post-MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its potential clinical use, we determined here therapeutic time window (0, 45, and 90 min post-MCAO) and the neuroprotective dose (2 ml/kg, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mM) of SOV in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single injection of 50 mM SOV at 0 or 45 min post-MCAO produced similar neuroprotective effects, and even 50 mM delivered 90 min post-MCAO exerted significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the maximal neuroprotective effect was obtained at 50 mM SOV, 25 mM injected once and 12.5 mM delivered at 0 and 45 min post-MCAO significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also documented that SOV treatment ameliorates ischemic neuronal cell injury via the activation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), inhibits serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and elicits the gradual recovery of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after transient MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the important factor(s) involved in the neuronal protection afforded by SOV, we measured Akt and ERK activity, physiological parameters, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and rCBF following various SOV treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Akt activation was the most important factor in SOV-induced neuroprotection; ERK activation, the gradual recovery of rCBF, and decreased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were weak contributors </plain></SENT>
