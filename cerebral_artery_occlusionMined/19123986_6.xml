<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess longitudinal changes in T-cell numbers in the lymphoid organs of living mice after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was carried out in transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP+) in the T-cell population under the control of the hCD2 locus control region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed by three-dimensional fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) before and at several time points after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or sham operation and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 7, GFP+ cell content in lymphoid organs was measured postmortem by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GFP+ cell numbers and in vivo FMT signal intensity were reduced at day 7 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and, to a lesser extent, after sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis demonstrated that postmortem GFP+ cell numbers and corresponding in vivo FMT data were significantly correlated in the thymus (r2 = .65, p &lt; .0001) and lymph nodes (r2 = .67, p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These relationships allowed inferring the number of GFP+ T cells from in vivo FMT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show the time course reduction of T-cell content in the lymphoid organs of living mice, providing in vivo evidence of lymphoid organ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and, to a lesser extent, after head surgery with craniectomy and dura mater opening in sham-operated mice </plain></SENT>
