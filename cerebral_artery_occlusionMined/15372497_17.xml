<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyze cortical expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Fas, and Fas ligand (FasL) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> after a transient, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats subjected to preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were determined using a semiquantitative RT-PCR in the ischemic and contralateral cortex, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> was induced by 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and neurologic deficits as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were quantified </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both preconditioning paradigms, similar effects on investigated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were decreased in tolerant rats compared to those in nontolerant ones </plain></SENT>
