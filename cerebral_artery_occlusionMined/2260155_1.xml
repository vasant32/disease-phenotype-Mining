<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6, 12, or 24 hours, brains were frozen, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and local brain pH were quantified by standard histology or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27510">umbelliferone</z:chebi> technique, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control rats, cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was increased from 29.5 microliters at 6 hours to 72.5 microliters at 24 hours after vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In striatum only, an insignificant increase from 15.2 to 24.7 microliters in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> increased from 7% to 22% in cortical and from 4% to 39% in the striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), given 45 minutes before and again 8 and 16 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, did not alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 6 hours but considerably improved outcome at later times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> formation was lower at 12 hours in the group treated with the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, effects on local brain pH were seen as early as 6 hours after the vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine greatly reduced the areas exhibiting the lowest pH values beyond pH 6.0 (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar effects by nimodipine on brain pH were observed in the 12-hour series, whereas at 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a shift to more alkalotic values was noted with no overt differences between control and drug-treated groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
