<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by an intraluminal filament is a widely accepted animal model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this procedure, cutting of the external carotid artery (ECA) is a prerequisite for thread insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the implications of ECA transsection have not yet been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After 90 minutes of filament MCAO or sham surgery, rats were evaluated for up to 14 days in terms of body weight development, core temperature, and motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated in vivo MRI of the head and neck was performed for quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The temporal muscles were histologically analyzed postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 47% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, ischemic tissue damage to the ipsilateral ECA area, including temporal, lingual, and pharyngeal musculature, was detectable by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histology of temporal muscles confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals with ECA territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (ECA-I) showed delayed body weight development and poorer recovery of motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> or final cerebral lesion size between ECA-I-affected and unaffected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filament MCAO was complicated by the consequences of ECA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impaired mastication and swallowing functions restricted ingestion and resulted in postsurgical body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and worse motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Impaired cerebral microperfusion resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and reduced spontaneous motor activity resulting from reduced food and water uptake might have contributed to poorer neurological recovery in ECA ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, adverse effects caused by extracerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with potential impact on outcome have to be considered in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
