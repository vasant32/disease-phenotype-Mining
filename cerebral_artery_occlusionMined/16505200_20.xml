<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide the new therapeutic options, we examined the effect of overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by transferring the HGF gene into the brain using hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty rats were exposed to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the sensorimotor deficits at day 7, the rats were divided equally into control vector or HGF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 56, rats transfected with the HGF gene showed a significant recovery of learning and memory in <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tests (control vector 50+/-4 s; HGF 33+/-5 s; P&lt;0.05) and passive avoidance task (control vector 132.4+/-37.5 s; HGF 214.8+/-26.5 s; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the total volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was not related to the outcome, immunohistochemical analysis for Cdc42 and synaptophysin in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region revealed that HGF enhanced the neurite extension and increased synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for glial fibriary acidic protein revealed that the formation of glial scar was also prevented by HGF gene treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the number of the arteries was increased in the HGF group at day 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated that HGF has a pivotal role for the functional recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> through neuritogenesis, improved microcirculation, and the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide evidence for the feasibility of gene therapy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
