<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Ischemic penumbra (IP), the target of thrombolytic therapies, could be estimated by the mismatch region between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion- and perfusion-defined abnormalities; however, the accuracy of this method has been challenged recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we try to establish a method for calculating IP size based on computed tomography perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) and to observe the early evolution of IP in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in monkey was used to compare the accuracy in estimating the IP between <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> and MRI methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to calculate the IP threshold of the different <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> parameters, and then the best parameter was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dynamic evolutions of estimated size of IP by these two methods were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the three <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> parameters, relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) had the highest sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (98.5%) in estimating the IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutoff threshold of rCBF was 0.203 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the first 15 hours of the MCAO model, the estimated size of IP by the rCBF was larger than that of the MRI method; however, this relationship was reversed 15 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the rCBF method is more accurate in estimating the IP since previous studies have reported that the MRI method underestimated the exact IP in the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and overestimated the exact IP in the later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to validate the conclusion </plain></SENT>
