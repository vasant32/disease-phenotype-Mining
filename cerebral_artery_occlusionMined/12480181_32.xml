<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using an intravascular poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated filament, and brains were removed after 3 h of recirculation for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A differential measurement of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> from post-ischemic and sham control animals was performed using the Mouse UniGene 1 microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Established values for differential expression were used (&gt; or =1.7 or &lt; or =-1.7 fold), and hits (n=2-3 arrays) divided into known '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response' genes and 'newly connected' annotated genes. n=28 ischemia-<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response genes were up-regulated and n=6 were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regulated genes comprised immediate early genes, heat shock proteins, anti-oxidative enzymes, trophic factors, and genes involved in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cell signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the ability of the microarray to replicate known changes in gene expression, n=35 newly connected genes were found up-regulated and n=41 down-regulated </plain></SENT>
