<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EEG potentials were recorded directly from the cortical surface using a bipolar disc electrode grid and were analyzed by computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups of 5 animals each underwent temporary occlusion of the left middle cerebral arterial trunk for 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG data were recorded from the cortex proximal (temporal site) and distal (parasagittal site) to the middle cerebral arterial trunk during occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG suppression was detected immediately after occlusion at the temporal site by analysis of power spectra in 29 of 30 rabbits (mean power, 32% of base line), by compressed spectral array (CSA) edge analysis in 23, and by analysis of the conventional EEG wave form in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 5 minutes after the start of occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 rabbits showed EEG power suppression and 26 showed decrease in the CSA edge frequency or in the routine EEG wave form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the end of the occlusion period, EEG power at the temporal site had decreased to 20.5% of base line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the parasagittal site, a lesser degree of EEG suppression was detected; 20 rabbits had an initial loss of EEG power (mean, 85.7% of base line), 13 had decrease in the CSA edge, and 7 had suppression of the EEG wave form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By the end of the occlusion period, spectral power at the parasagittal site had decreased in 25 of 30 rabbits to a mean of 86.9% of base line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
