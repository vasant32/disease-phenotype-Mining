<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its treatment has completely changed over the past decade with different interventional approaches, such as intravenous trials, intra-arterial trials, combined intravenous/intra-arterial trials, and newer devices to mechanically remove the clot from intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plaminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours of symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological intra-arterial thrombolysis has been shown effective until 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and offers a higher rate of recanalization compared with intravenous thrombolysis, whereas combined intravenous/ intra-arterial thrombolysis seems to be as safe as isolated intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The more recent advances in reperfusion therapies have been done in mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> disruption or removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Merci Retriever and Penumbra System have been approved for clot removal in brain arteries, but not as a therapeutic modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> since it is no clear whether mechanical thrombectomy improves clinical outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, mechanical devices are being used in clinical practice for patients who are ineligible for tPA or who have failed to respond to intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
