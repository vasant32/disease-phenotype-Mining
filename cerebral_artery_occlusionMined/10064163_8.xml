<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> possess other mechanism of action that may be critical to their protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If so, it is conceivable that the peak effect of such mechanisms does not parallel the reduction in CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, maximal neuroprotection may be achieved with a substantially lower dose of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> while either anesthetized with (1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (control) or (2) intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> titrated to cause mild EEG suppression or (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> titrated to maintain EEG burst suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was recorded by continuous bilateral laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed after 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> decreased blood flow to 80% of baseline and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> to 70% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LDF did not indicate improvement of blood flow by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 28% and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> by 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study and a review of literature indicate that <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> provide cerebral protection but that the magnitude of this effect has been overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms than CMR reduction seem to contribute to their beneficial effects, and high doses administered to the point of burst suppression may not be required to obtain maximal protection </plain></SENT>
