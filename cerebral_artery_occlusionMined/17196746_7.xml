<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that CysLT(1) receptor expression is increased in rat brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the increased expression is spatio-temporally related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury and late astrocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report spatio-temporal expression of CysLT(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in rat brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by 30min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the neuron density was gradually decreased or disappeared in the ischemic core and boundary zone during 14 days after reperfusion, and the astrocyte population in the boundary zone was increased 3-14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, the expression of CysLT(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased at 6, 12 and 24h and then recovered at 3, 7 and 14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the boundary zone, the expression was significantly increased 3, 7 and 14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that CysLT(2) receptor may be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury and late astrocyte proliferation in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
