<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the pharmacological profile of KCL-440, a new PARP inhibitor, and its neuroprotective effects in the rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> model induced by photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro study, KCL-440 exhibited potency with regard to inhibition of PARP activity, with an IC50 value of 68 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An in vivo pharmacokinetic study showed that the brain concentration of KCL-440 was sufficient to inhibit PARP activity during the intravenous infusion of KCL-440 at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KCL-440 at various doses or saline was administered for 24 h immediately after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of KCL-440 led to a dose-dependent reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> sizes were 44.8% +/- 3.0% (n = 8), 40.5% +/- 1.1% (n = 8), 38.2% +/- 1.4% (n = 8), 35.1% +/- 2.1% (n = 8), 34.2% +/- 2.3% (n = 7), 32.6% +/- 1.9% (n = 8), and 31.0% +/- 2.1% (n = 5) at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control group, a statistically significant difference was observed in the doses that were higher than 0.03 mg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the infusion of KCL-440 (1 mg/kg/h, n = 8) was started at 1 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was observed; this was not observed when KCL-440 infusion was started 2 or 3 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) immunostaining was confirmed at the ischemic border zone 2 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and it was reduced by KCL-440 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that KCL-440 is a possible neuroprotective agent with high blood-brain barrier permeability and high PARP inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
