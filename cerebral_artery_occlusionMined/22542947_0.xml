<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA), an omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, have beneficial effects on cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DHA is the precursor of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which downregulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and, in turn, promotes cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have tested the effect of aspirin plus DHA administration and discovered the synthesis of aspirin-triggered NPD1 (AT-NPD1) in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then we performed the total chemical synthesis of this molecule and tested in the setting of 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated at 24h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, an intravenous administration of 333 Î¼g/kg of AT-NPD1 <z:chebi fb="8" ids="26714">sodium salt</z:chebi> (AT-NPD1-SS) or <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (AT-NPD1-ME) or vehicle (saline) as treatment was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 7, ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brains was conducted on 11.7 T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T2WI, 3D volumes, and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and number of GFAP (reactive astrocytes), ED-1 (activated microglia/macrophages) and SMI-71-positive vessels were counted in the cortex and striatum at the level of the central lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed similar values for rectal and cranial temperatures, arterial blood gases, and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during and after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME significantly improved neurological scores compared to saline treatment at 24h, 48 h, 72 h and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volumes computed from T2WI images were significantly reduced by both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME treatment in the cortex (by 44% and 81%), striatum (by 61% and 77%) and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (by 48% and 78%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo>, computed from T2WI in the cortex (penumbra) and striatum (core), was elevated in the saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both AT-NPD1 decreased water content in the striatum on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>3D volumes, computed from T2WI, were dramatically reduced with both AT-NPD1 and the lesion was mostly localized in the subcortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment with both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME significantly reduced cortical (by 76% and 96%), subcortical (by 61% and 70%) and total (69% and 84%, respectively) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as defined by histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a novel biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of AT-NPD1 mediator in the brain was discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, administration of synthetic AT-NPD1, in either its <z:chebi fb="8" ids="26714">sodium salt</z:chebi> or as the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, was able to attenuate cerebral ischemic injury which leads to a novel approach for pharmaceutical intervention and clinical translation </plain></SENT>
