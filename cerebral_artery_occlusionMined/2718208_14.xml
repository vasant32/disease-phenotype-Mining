<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate phosphodiesterase, on the pial vessels of adult cats subjected to endothelial damage followed by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six cats were treated with cilostazol and four with 30% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17741">N,N-dimethylformamide</z:chebi> in 70% saline (solvent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain surface was irradiated with ultraviolet rays through a cranial window for 3 minutes to selectively damage the endothelium of the pial vessels in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning 32 minutes after termination of the irradiation, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes before occlusion, intravenous infusion of 30 micrograms/kg/min cilostazol or 0.1 ml/kg/min solvent was begun and continued until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before occlusion, the infusion of cilostazol induced a significant (p less than 0.05) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> while the infusion of solvent produced no significant changes in the diameter of the pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pial veins of solvent-treated cats showed significant (p less than 0.05) constriction during occlusion, whereas cilostazol-treated cats exhibited only mild constriction of the pial veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The formation of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> after occlusion was significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited in the pial veins of cilostazol-treated compared with solvent-treated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the microcirculation of the pial veins was effectively restored after reopening of the middle cerebral artery in cilostazol-treated compared with solvent-treated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that cilostazol is an effective antithrombotic agent as well as a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> acting on vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
