<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that pretreatment with electroacupuncture (EA) elicited protective effects against transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through cannabinoid receptor type 1 receptor (CB1R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether or not the extracellular signal regulated-kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway was involved in the ischemic tolerance induced by EA pretreatment through CB1R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 24h after the end of the last EA pretreatment, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120min in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated at 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of p-ERK1/2 in the brains was also investigated in the presence or absence of CB1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AM251 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EA pretreatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurological outcome at 24h after reperfusion, and the beneficial effects were abolished by U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blockade of CB1R by AM251 reversed the up-regulation of p-ERK1/2 expression induced by EA pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway might be involved in EA pretreatment-induced cerebral ischemic tolerance via cannabinoid CB1 receptor in rats </plain></SENT>
