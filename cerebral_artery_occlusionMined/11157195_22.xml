<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background and Purpose-Chemokines have been shown to play an important role in leukocyte and monocyte/macrophage infiltration into ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to identify whether overexpression of the active human transforming growth factor-ss1 (ahTGF-ss1) can downregulate expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and reduce ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:-Overexpression of transforming growth factor-ss1 (TGF-ss1) was achieved through adenoviral gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five days after adenoviral transduction, the mouse underwent 30 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 1 to 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGF-ss1, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, MIP-1alpha, and ICAM-1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> areas and volumes were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha expression is increased after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and double-labeled immunostaining revealed that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is colocalized with neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp>-mediated TGF-ss1 overexpression was significantly greater at measured time points, with a peak at 7 to 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha, but not ICAM-1, was reduced in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 (P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 (P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:-This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha expressed in the ischemic region may play an important role in attracting inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha, but not ICAM-1, in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 suggests that the neuroprotective effect of TGF-ss1 may result from the inhibition of chemokines during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
