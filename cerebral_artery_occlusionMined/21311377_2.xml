<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The donor cell culture in animal serum-free medium is important for the clinical application of cell transplantation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, human-derived platelet lysate (PL) gained interest as a substitute for fetal calf serum (FCS), but there are no studies that evaluate the validity of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) expanded with PL-containing medium for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that hBMSCs expanded with FCS-free, PL-containing medium can promote functional recovery after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: hBMSCs were cultured in the FCS- or PL-containing medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell-growth kinetics were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vehicle or hBMSCs was stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor function was assessed for 8 weeks, and the fate of transplanted hBMSCs was examined using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in hBMSC expansion between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of hBMSCs expanded with the FCS- or PL-containing medium equally promoted functional recovery compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in their migration, survival, and neural differentiation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: hBMSCs expanded with PL-containing medium retained their capacity of migration, survival, and differentiation and significantly promoted functional recovery when stereotactically transplanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PL may be a clinically valuable and safe substitute for FCS in expanding hBMSCs to regenerate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
