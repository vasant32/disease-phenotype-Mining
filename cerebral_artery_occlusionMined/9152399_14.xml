<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel group of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compounds, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38670">pyrrolopyrimidines</z:chebi>, has been discovered recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these possess significantly improved oral bioavailability (56-70% in rats), increased efficacy and potency in protecting cultured neurons against iron-induced <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidative injury and as much as a 5-fold increase in brain uptake compared with the 21-aminosteroid <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compound, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), described earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They appear to quench <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation reactions by electron-donating and/or radical-trapping mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several compounds in the series, such as U-101033E and U-104067F, demonstrate greater ability than tirilazad to protect the hippocampal CA1 region in the gerbil transient (5-min) forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delaying treatment until 4 hr after the ischemic insult still results in significant CA1 neuronal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>U-101033E is still effective in salvaging a portion of the CA1 neuronal population when the ischemic duration is extended to 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, U-101033E has been found to be protective in the context of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the mouse permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, in contrast to tirilazad which is minimally effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compounds with improved brain parenchymal penetration are better able to limit certain types of ischemic brain damage than those which are localized in the cerebral microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the activity of U-101033E in improving early post-traumatic recovery in mice subjected to severe concussive head injury is similar to that of tirilazad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Last, the oral bioavailability of many <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38670">pyrrolopyrimidines</z:chebi> suggests that they may be useful for certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> in which <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation plays a role </plain></SENT>
