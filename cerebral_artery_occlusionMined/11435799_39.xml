<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to investigate protein aggregation and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein aggregation was analyzed by electron microscopy, laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced protein aggregation in ischemic neocortical neurons at 1 hour of reperfusion, and protein aggregation persisted until neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein aggregates were found in the neuronal soma, dendrites, and axons, and they were associated with intracellular membranous structures during the postischemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-resolution confocal microscopy showed that clumped protein aggregates surrounding nuclei and along dendrites were formed after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Western blots, ubiquitinated proteins (ubi-proteins) were dramatically increased in neocortical tissues in the postischemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ubi-proteins were <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi>-insoluble, indicating that they might be irreversibly aggregated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The formation of ubi-protein aggregates after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> correlated well with the observed decrease in free ubiquitin and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that proteins are severely damaged and aggregated in neurons after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors propose that protein damage or aggregation may contribute to ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
