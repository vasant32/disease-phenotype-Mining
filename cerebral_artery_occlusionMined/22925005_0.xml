<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at validating the neuroprotective effects of IPostC and investigating whether the neuroprotection of IPostC is associated with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and the extracellular matrix proteins, laminin and fibronectin, following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rats in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group underwent MCAO and reperfusion, and the animals in MCAO + IPostC group were treated by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries for 10 seconds and then reperfusing for 10 seconds for five episodes at the beginning of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP9, laminin, and fibronectin was measured with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IPostC reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved the neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IPostC decreased cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> compared with the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the MCAO group, IPostC treatment reduced MMP9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results showed that the expression of laminin and fibronectin significantly increased in the MCAO + IPostC group compared to the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that diminishment of MMP9 expression and the attenuation of degradation of laminin and fibronectin may be involved in the protective mechanisms of postconditioning against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
