<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NOx) levels in plasma, ischemic brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased significantly 24h after 2h transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADMA levels were unchanged in plasma, but decreased significantly in CSF 24h following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF ADMA/NOx ratio decreased markedly following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats protected by expression of the chaperonin GroEL or its folding deficient mutant D87K had lower plasma NOx levels at 24h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADMA, NO, and their ratio in CSF merit further study as biomarkers for ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
