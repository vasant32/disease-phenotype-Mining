<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the multiexponential relaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization with and without a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-based paramagnetic contrast agent in spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats (SHR-SP) and in the rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the multiexponential relaxation, the presence of two T(2) relaxation times in the range of 0.03-0.5 s, T(2A) (shortest) and T(2B) (longest), with very different relative weights (respectively, A and B), is evidenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our models of cerebral damage, the changes in A and B were more evident than those in T(2A) and T(2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two T(2) values were interpreted as belonging to water molecules in two different compartments; therefore, the difference between the damaged and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regions revealed by means of standard T(2)-weighted images is suggested to be due to a different water distribution in the two compartments, rather than different T(2)'s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T(2) relaxation in the SHR-SP <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model is analyzed for the first time using a multiexponential method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The power of a detailed analysis of MRI relaxation times is confirmed by the correspondence between the revealed changes in T(2A), T(2B), A and B, and the known T(2)W and DWI results about blood-brain barrier functionality </plain></SENT>
