<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis probes were inserted into the lateral part of the caudate-putamen bilaterally 2 h before the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, the concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> rose markedly in the ECF on the occluded side, while there was no significant change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by dramatically elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a marked increase in alanine/tyrosine, while minor or no changes occurred with other amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the ECF level of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate and homovanillic acid decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in any of the metabolites measured on the right, nonoccluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In relation to the concept of excitotoxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, it is concluded that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the ECF is flooded with both potentially harmful (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) and protective (e.g., <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>) agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative importance of these events for the development of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ischemic penumbra needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
