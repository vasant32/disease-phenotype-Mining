<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (rhIL-1ra) on brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that low amounts of rhIL-1ra injected directly into the brain significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAo or excitotoxic injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral administration of rhIL-1ra (100 mg/kg sc at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 18 h after MCAo) significantly inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, by 46% (P &lt; 0.05), measured at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was greater than the effect of MK801 administered immediately after MCAo (4 mg/kg ip, 0 h) which did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rhIL-1ra (100 mg/kg also significantly inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation by 49% (p&lt; 0.05 measured 24 h after MCAo, but did not reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation measured 2 h after MCAo, but did not reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation measured 2 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of infarction by rhIL-1ra was dependent on dose and time of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together the results demonstrate that peripherally administered rhIL-1ra at high doses is able to mimic the efficacy of low dose of rhIL-1ra administered directly into the brain in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that protection observed with rhIL-1ra was better than that offered by MK801 in this model </plain></SENT>
