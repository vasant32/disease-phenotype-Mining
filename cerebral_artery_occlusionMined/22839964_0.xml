<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) ameliorated ischemic tissue injury in the rat brain and accelerated functional recovery after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous tooth (SHED)-derived conditioned medium (SHED-CM) on permanent MCAO (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SHED-CM were then administered intranasally, and the motor function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis and vasculogenesis were determined using immunochemical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SHED-CM group had more positive signals than the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium group, with doublecortin (DCX), neurofilament H, neuronal nuclei, and rat endothelial cell antigen observed in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Migration of neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) with DCX from the subventricular zone to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was observed on days 6 and 16, with migration on day 6 being the most prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SHED-CM promoted the migration and differentiation of endogenous NPC, induced vasculogenesis, and ameliorated ischemic brain injury after pMCAO as well as transplantation of DPSC </plain></SENT>
