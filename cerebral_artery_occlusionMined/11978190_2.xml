<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1, and Tie-2 were measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein express ions of VEGF and Ang-2 were determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1, and Tie-2 were constitutively expressed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex of mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the expressions of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 mRNA were dramatically increased in the infarcted cortex and the elevation was remained through 7 d of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of Ang-1 and Tie-1 mRNA were unchanged in the infarcted cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities of Ang-2 or VEGF were hardly observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ang-2 protein was evidently detected in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core 8 h after MCAO and in t he perifocal area 1 d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of VEGF protein was elevated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core 2 h after MCAO and in the perifocal area 1 d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoreaction was restricted to endothelial cells and glial-like cells within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and perifocal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expressions of An g-2 and VEGF are induced after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which may contribute to the angiogenic response in the cortex of ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
