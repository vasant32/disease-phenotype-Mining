<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Brain responses to external stimuli after permanent and transient ischemic insults have been documented using cerebral blood volume weighted (CBVw) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in correlation with tissue damage and neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we extend our previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery in rat models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by comparing blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responses to forepaw stimulation were measured in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (n=5) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to evaluate the recovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, animals showed variable degrees of fMRI activation in ipsilesional cortex, the extent of which did not correlate with structural damages as measured using apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, blood volume, and vessel size index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the contralesional cortex showed good overlap between BOLD and CBV-activated regions, the ipsilesional cortex showed low covariance between significantly activated voxels by BOLD and CBVw techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the relative activation during contralateral stimuli in the ipsilesional somatosensory cortex was significantly higher for CBVw responses than BOLD, which might be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related alterations in fMRI hemodynamic coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aberrant subcortical activations were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When unaffected forelimbs were stimulated, strong bilateral responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, little thalamic responses accompanied stimulation of affected forelimbs despite significant activation in the ipsilesional somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affects not only local hemodynamics and coupling but also other factors including neural connectivity </plain></SENT>
