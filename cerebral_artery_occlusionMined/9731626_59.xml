<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An objective of therapeutic intervention after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is to promote improved functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved outcome may be associated with a reduction of the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and the promotion of cerebral plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the developing brain, neuronal growth is concomitant with expression of particular proteins, including microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we measured the expression of select proteins associated with neurite damage and plasticity (MAP-2 and GAP-43) as well as cell cycle (cyclin D1) after induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brains from rats (n=28) subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 6 hours, 12 hours, and 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days (n=4 per time point) of reperfusion and control sham-operated (n=3) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n=2) rats were processed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies raised against MAP-2, GAP-43, and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining of these proteins for cellular colocalization was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of immunoreactivity of both MAP-2 and GAP-43 was observed in most damaged neurons in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MAP-2, GAP-43, and cyclin D1 were selectively increased in morphologically intact or altered neurons localized to the ischemic core at an early stage (eg, 6 hours) of reperfusion and in the boundary zone to the ischemic core (penumbra) during longer reperfusion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The selective expressions of the neuronal structural proteins (MAP-2 in dendrites and GAP-43 in axons) and the cyclin D1 cell cycle protein in neurons observed in the boundary zone to the ischemic core are suggestive of compensatory and repair mechanisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-damaged neurons after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
