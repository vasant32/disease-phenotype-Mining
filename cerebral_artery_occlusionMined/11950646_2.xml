<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, not only the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but also its duration are key determinants of tissue survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to show the synergistic effects of these two factors on tissue survival in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed findings in 19 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who had clearly defined ischemic duration from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to angiographic complete recanalization and who underwent pretreatment single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT and final CT scans were compared, and hypoperfusion cortices were divided into reversible and irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest were placed in both irreversible and reversible ischemic cortices, and the residual cerebral blood flow was analyzed by side-to-side comparison with a calculated asymmetry index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To show the relationship between the reversibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the ischemic duration/severity, discriminant analyses were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analyses were conducted separately using data obtained within 3 hours of ischemic duration and data obtained more than 3 hours after ischemic duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 3 hours of ischemic duration, analysis revealed a discriminant line of asymmetry index (%) = 21.53 time (h) - 19.15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After more than 3 hours of ischemic duration, it revealed a discriminant line of asymmetry index = 0.50 time + 48.27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These discriminant lines rose rapidly within the first 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and thereafter reached almost a plateau level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These pilot data suggest urgency for treatment, less need for triage based on cerebral blood flow measurement during the first few hours, and more time to triage based on cerebral blood flow measurement for patients with later presentations </plain></SENT>
