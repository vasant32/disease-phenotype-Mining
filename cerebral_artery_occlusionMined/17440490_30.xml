<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the role of macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes in the expansion of ischaemic injury has been widely studied, the relative contribution of these cells, either of exogenous or intrinsic central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) origin is still not entirely clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to use different durations of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) in the mouse to investigate fully post-occlusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and cellular changes in the brain during the 72 h post-MCAo period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was achieved using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cell labelling techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown and formation of the primary ischaemic damage after tMCAo is not associated with significant infiltration of neutrophils, although more are observed with longer periods of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observe very few infiltrating exogenous macrophages over a 72 h period after 30 or 60 mins of occlusion, instead a profound increase in proliferating resident microglia cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the more severe injury associated with 60 mins of MCAo leads to a markedly reduced proliferation of resident microglial cells, suggesting that these cells may play a protective function, possibly through phagocytosis of infiltrating neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data further support possible beneficial actions of microglial cells in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
