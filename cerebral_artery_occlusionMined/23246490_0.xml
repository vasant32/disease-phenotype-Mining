<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the transcriptional regulatory elements responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced gene expression, we examined gene expression profiles of rat brains following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and performed computational analysis of consensus transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the genes of the dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, rats were sacrificed 24h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and gene transcription in brain tissues following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion was examined using Affymetrix GeneChip technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CONserved transcription FACtor binding site (CONFAC) software package was used to identify over-represented TFBS in the upstream promoter regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced genes compared to control datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONFAC identified 12 TFBS that were statistically over-represented from our dataset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced genes, including three members of the Ets-1 family of transcription factors (TFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microarray results showed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for Ets-1 was increased following tMCAO but not pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of Ets-1 protein in rat brains following MCAO showed that Ets-1 was highly expressed in neurons in the brain of sham control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ets-1 protein expression was virtually abolished in injured neurons of the ischemic brain but was unchanged in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that TFs, including Ets-1, may influence neuronal injury following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings could provide important insights into the mechanisms that lead to brain injury and could provide avenues for the development of novel therapies </plain></SENT>
