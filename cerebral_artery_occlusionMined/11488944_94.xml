<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis in the adult rat dentate gyrus was studied following focal ischemic insults produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to either 30 min of MCAO, which causes damage confined to the striatum, or 2 h of MCAO, which leads to both striatal and cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared to sham-operated rats, MCAO-rats showed a marked increase of the number of cells double-labelled for 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (BrdU; injected during 4-6 days postischemia) and neuronal-specific antigen (NeuN; a marker of postmitotic neurons) in the ipsilateral dentate granule cell layer and subgranular zone at 5 weeks following the 2 h insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a modest and variable increase of BrdU-labelled cells was found after 30 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced neurogenesis was not dependent on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus, and its magnitude was not correlated to the degree of cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor blocker dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) completely suppressed the elevated neurogenesis following 2 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> leads to increased neurogenesis in the adult rat dentate gyrus through glutamatergic mechanisms acting on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This modulatory effect may be mediated through changes in the levels of several growth factors, which occur after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and could influence various regulatory steps of neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
