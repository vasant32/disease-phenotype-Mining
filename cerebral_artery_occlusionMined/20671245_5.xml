<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that niacin treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promotes synaptic plasticity and axon growth in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with or without Niaspan (a prolonged-release formulation of niacin, 40 mg/kg) daily for 14 days starting 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of synaptophysin, Nogo receptor, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B were measured by immunohistostaining and Western blot, respectively, in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complementing in vivo studies, primary cultured neurons were used to test the effect of niacin and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> on neurite outgrowth and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly increased synaptophysin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver, brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B expression, and decreased Nogo receptor expression in the ischemic brain compared with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> control animals (P&lt;0.05, n=8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Niacin and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased neurite outgrowth and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B expression in primary cultured neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tropomyosin-related kinase B inhibitor attenuated niacin-induced neurite outgrowth (P&lt;0.05, n=6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Niacin treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promotes synaptic plasticity and axon growth, which is mediated, at least partially, by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B pathways </plain></SENT>
