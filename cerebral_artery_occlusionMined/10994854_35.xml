<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the activation, topographic distribution, and cellular location of three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated MAPKs expression in the ischemic region was quantified using Western blot analysis and localized immunohistochemically using the diaminobenzide staining and double-labeled immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2), p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (p38), and c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) were initially activated at 30 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively, after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak expression represented a 2.7-fold, 3.7-fold, and 4.8-fold increase in each of these MAPKs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical expressions of ERK1, ERK2, p38, and SAPK/JNK protein paralleled the Western blot analysis results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double-labeled immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that the neurons and astrocytes expressed ERK1, ERK2, p38, and SAPK/JNK during the early time points after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current results demonstrate that brain damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rapidly triggers time-dependent ERK1, ERK2, p38, and SAPK/ JNK phosphorylation, and reveals that neurons and astrocytes are involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This very early expression of MAPKs suggests that MAPKs may be closely involved in signal transduction during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
