<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical technique was used to examine growth-associated protein GAP-43 expression following cerebral hemitransection or transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the substantia nigra of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GAP-43 expression was transiently elevated in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons, but not in the pars compacta neurons at 3 and 4 days post-hemitransection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Massive striatal ischemic injury produced by transient MCAO also caused an increase in GAP-43 synthesis in the SNr neurons at 3 and 4 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present findings raise the possibility that deafferentation of the GABAergic inputs leading to transneuronal regression of the SNr neurons is responsible for the elevated expression of GAP-43 in the substantia nigra of adult rats </plain></SENT>
