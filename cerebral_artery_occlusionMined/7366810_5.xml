<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the case studies reported to date in general reflect positively on this use of the bypass procedure, this report of a patient who failed to tolerate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> despite the presence of a patent superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery branch anastomosis points up several of the practical and theoretical limitations of this therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Certain modifications of the timing of the bypass procedure, the selection of donor and recipient arteries, and the mechanics of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> may allow a wider application of extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass in this therapeutic setting </plain></SENT>
