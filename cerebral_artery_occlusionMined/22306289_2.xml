<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its optimal therapeutic time window and the mechanism are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to explore the therapeutic time window and mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and 40g/kg of Buyang Huanwu Decoction was intragastrically infused at different time points, and the same dose was infused every 24h for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in cerebrospinal fluid and the expression of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor-1 RNA in striatum were detected before, during, and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes were measured at 72h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion resulted in significant neurological deficit and extensive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, associated with a large amount of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in cerebrospinal fluid and elevation of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor-1 RNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Buyang Huanwu Decoction significantly suppressed the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and reduced the expression of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor-1 RNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neurological defect score and infarction volume were significantly improved by administration of Buyang Huanwu Decoction, when compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Buyang Huanwu Decoction, within 4h of post-transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reduced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction is, in part, associated with the down-regulation of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor-1 RNA and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
