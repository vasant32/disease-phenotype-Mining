<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using both in vitro and in vivo paradigms, this study examined the role of Akt signaling and peroxiredoxin 4 expression in human umbilical cord blood cell-mediated protection of oligodendrocytes from ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, the addition of HUCB cells to oligodendrocyte cultures prior to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation significantly enhanced oligodendrocyte survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of human umbilical cord blood cells also increased Akt phosphorylation and elevated peroxiredoxin 4 expression in oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blocking either Akt or peroxiredoxin 4 activity with Akt Inhibitor IV or a peroxiredoxin 4-neutralizing antibody, respectively, negated the protective effects of human umbilical cord blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, systemic administration of human umbilical cord blood cells 48 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> increased Akt phosphorylation and peroxiredoxin 4 protein expression while reducing proteolytic cleavage of caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes residing in the ipsilateral external capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, human umbilical cord blood cells protected striatal white matter bundles from degeneration following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the soluble factors released from human umbilical cord blood cells converge on Akt to elevate peroxiredoxin 4 levels, and these effects contribute to oligodendrocyte survival </plain></SENT>
