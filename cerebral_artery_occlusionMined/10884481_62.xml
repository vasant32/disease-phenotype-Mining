<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expansion of ischemic infarction and response of oligodendrocytes were investigated together with accumulation of inflammatory cells, production of interleukin-1beta, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was inferred from fragmented DNA and the expression of proapoptotic Bax protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During expansion of infarction, amoeboid microglia and extravasation of serum albumin were observed not only in the infarcted area but also in the adjacent surviving area, whereas macrophages accumulated along the boundary and granulocytes migrated into the center of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both amoeboid microglia and macrophages produced interleukin-1beta, an inflammatory cytokine, during an early ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, macrophages within the infarcted tissue expressed Bax protein and subsequently showed fragmented nuclear DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oligodendrocytes were detected in the infarcted area even after 24 hours following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but they subsequently developed fragmented DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, oligodendrocytes were found to be accumulated in the intact area bordered with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> together with reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the importance of amoeboid microglia, macrophages, and their interleukin-1beta production in gradual expansion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Resident oligodendrocytes may be resistant to ischemic insults, and oligodendrocytes accumulated at the border of the infarction may participate in tissue repair after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
