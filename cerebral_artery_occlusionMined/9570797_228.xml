<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive caspase-3p32 but not its cleavage product caspase-3p20 was constitutively expressed in neurons throughout brain and was most prominent in neuronal perikarya within piriform cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caspase-like enzyme activity was elevated in brain homogenate 0-3 hr after reperfusion and reached a peak within 30 to 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3p20 immunoreactivity became prominent in neuronal perikarya within the middle cerebral artery territory at the time of reperfusion and on immunoblots 1-12 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA laddering (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-stained cells were detected 6-24 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12-24 hr, immunoreactive p20 was visualized in TUNEL-positive cells, a finding also observed in apoptotic mouse cerebellar granule cells on postnatal day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations suggest the existence of a time-dependent evolution of ischemic injury characterized by the close correspondence between caspase-like enzyme activation and an associated increase in immunoreactive product (caspase-3p20) beginning at or before reperfusion and followed several hours later by morphological and biochemical features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
