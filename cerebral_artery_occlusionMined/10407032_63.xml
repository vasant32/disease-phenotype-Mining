<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have provided evidence that neuronal cell loss after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involves programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, recent biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated the expression and activation of intracellular proteases, notably caspase-3, which act as both initiators and executors of the apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the involvement of caspases in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> we developed a panel of antibodies and investigated the spatial and temporal pattern of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our efforts focused on caspase-8 because its "apical" position within the enzymatic cascade of caspases makes it a potentially important therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of procaspase-8 was detectable in most cortical neurons, and proteolytic processing yielding the active form of caspase-8 was found as early as 6 hr after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced in rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This active form of caspase-8 was predominantly seen in the large pyramidal neurons of lamina V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Active caspase-3 was evident only in neurons located within lamina II/III starting at 24 hr after injury and in microglia throughout the core <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling, gel electrophoresis of DNA, and neuronal cell quantitation indicated that there was an early nonapoptotic loss of cortical neurons followed by a progressive elimination of neurons with features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the pattern of caspase expression occurring during delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> will vary depending on the neuronal phenotype </plain></SENT>
