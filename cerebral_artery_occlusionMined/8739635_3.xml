<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the interstrain difference between Wistar and Fischer-344 (F344) rats in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume after proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion might be explained by differences in excitotoxicity between both rat strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using microdialysis we measured during a 5 h period after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in the cerebral cortex and the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volume of striatal infarction was comparable in Wistar and F344 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found, however, in Wistar rats a significantly higher striatal efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> than in F344 rats, whereas the striatal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> efflux was of a similar magnitude in the two strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the (variably) smaller volume of cortical infarction in Wistar rats (than that in F344), the location of the microdialysis probe-membrane with respect to the area of cortical infarction differed between Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, a reliable comparison between the quantitative amount of amino acids in the dialysate from the cortical probes of both rat strains could not be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results, demonstrating differences in striatal excitotoxicity between Wistar and F344 rats after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, are the first to show interstrain differences in striatal pathophysiology of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> between these normotensive rat strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They do however not explain why <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion results in a significantly different volume of cortical infarction between Wistar and F344 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The F344 strain will probably show in a more sensitive way, as compared to Wistar rats, neuroprotective effects of agents that diminish excitotoxic damage during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
