<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible effect of MH and a combination of CE and MH (CE + MH) on the changes of infarction size, DNA fragmentation, and immunoreactivities for Bcl-2 and Bax after 24 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the estimation of ischemic brain injury, we calculated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region at 24 h after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for the detection of DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities for Bcl-2 and Bax were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction size after permanent MCAO was significantly reduced by CE+MH treatment (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarction size did not change significantly by application of MH alone (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining was remarkably reduced both in MH-treated animals and in CE + MH-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for Bcl-2 was greatly induced both in MH-treated animals and in CE + MH-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of immunoreactivity for Bcl-2 was obviously inhibited both in MH-treated animals and in CE + MH-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It suggests that temporary MH delays <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution and ameliorates neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but does not significantly reduce definite infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CE + MH not only ameliorates neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but also remarkably reduces infarction size </plain></SENT>
