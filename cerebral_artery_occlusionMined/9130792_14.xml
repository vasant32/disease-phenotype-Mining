<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether BW619C89 administered orally before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is cerebroprotective when rats are assessed at one day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and whether cerebroprotection is long lasting and related to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cerebroprotective oral dose of BW619C89 (20 mg/kg) was used to determine whether reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is long lasting and can be enhanced with continued therapy, and whether behavioural deficits occurring after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">disturbances in cognition</z:e> and motor coordination are ameliorated by treatment with BW619C89 </plain></SENT>
