<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was determined by infusion of a qualitative perfusion indicator, neutral red </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal evolution of alterations in regional energy metabolism was assessed by direct microquantitative histochemical analysis of high-energy phosphates, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion analyses demonstrated a perifocal region of diminished, but not absent perfusion up to 6 hr after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 24 hr, there was an abrupt demarcation between perfused and nonperfused regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Profound metabolic alterations were seen as early as 20 min after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was an area of intermediate metabolic derangement in the more medial portions of the lateral ipsilateral cortex up to 6 hr, by 24 hr there was an abrupt transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to abnormal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence of metabolic recovery was seen in this model of permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
