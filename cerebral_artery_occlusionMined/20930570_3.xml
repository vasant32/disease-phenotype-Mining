<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo detection of autophagy could be important for evaluating ischemic neural cell damage for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using novel green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) transgenic (Tg) mice, in vivo imaging of autophagy was performed at 1, 3 and 6 d after 60 min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo imaging of autophagy, testing of the autophagy inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> (3-MA), estern blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) and fluorescent analyses were performed on brain sections following tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo fluorescent signals were detected above the ischemic hemisphere through the skull bone at 1, 3 and 6 d after tMCAO, with a peak at 1 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with ex vivo fluorescence imaging. western blot analysis revealed maximum LC3-I and LC3-II expression at 1 d after tMCAO and fluorescence immunohistochemistry demonstrated that GFP-LC3-positive cells were primarily neuronal, not astroglial or microglial, cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of GFP-LC3/TUNEL double-positive cells was greater in the periischemic area than in the core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provided evidence of in vivo autophagy detection, with a peak at 1 d, in a live animal model following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel technique could be valuable for monitoring autophagic processes in vivo in live <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, as well as for clarifying the detailed role of autophagy in the ischemic brain, as well as in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
