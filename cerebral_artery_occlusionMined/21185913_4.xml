<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (Piog), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Piog has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by attenuation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because NF-κB is known to play a major role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, the present study was undertaken to elucidate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> attenuates ischemic neuronal damage through PPARγ-mediated suppression of NF-κB apoptotic signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model was induced by using an intraluminal filament technique in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Piog was administrated i.p. twice (24 h before and at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> insult) or once (10 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection of Piog was analyzed by assessing neurological deficits, infarction volume and morphological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway by Piog was evaluated by detecting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 with immunohistochemistry and its target gene p53 by real-time PCR, and the expression of phospholated NF-κB p65 (p- NF-κB p65) in primary cultured neurons and the protein levels of IκBα and p-ERK in the ischemic cortex or striatum with Western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contribution of a PPARγ mechanism to Piog's inhibitory effects on NF-κB and neuroprotection was evaluated by pretreatment with the PPARγ irreversible <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GW9662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in cultured primary neurons was induced by the oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and the protective effect of Piog on cultured neurons was measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Piog (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) reduced infarction volume, and improved morphological changes and motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Piog markedly up-regulated the protein levels of IκBα or p-ERK 6 h or 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Piog reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in the ischemic cortical cells and repressed the expression of p53 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with GW9662 blocked Piog-elicited reduction in infarction volume, the increase in protein levels of IκBα and p-ERK, the reduction in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 and the repression of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, Piog attenuated the OGD-induced neuronal damage and inhibited the OGD-induced increases in p- NF-κB p65 in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that Piog's neuroprotection appears to be associated with PPARγ-mediated suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
