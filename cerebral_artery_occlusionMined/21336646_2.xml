<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite 16 years of research on a number of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders, an effective treatment using this strategy has only been observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within this study we propose a novel system for delivering drugs into the brain named the simple diffusion (SDD) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To validate this technique, rats were subjected to a single intracranial (at the caudate nucleus), or intraperitoneal injection, of the compound citicoline, followed two hours later by a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that 12 h after pMCAO, with 0.0025 g kg(-1) citicoline, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 1/6 the size of the intraperitoneal group was achieved with a dose 1/800 of that required for the intraperitoneal group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that given the appropriate injection point, through SDD a pharmacologically effective concentration of citicoline can be administered </plain></SENT>
