<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ginkgo biloba extracts are now prescribed in several countries for their reported health benefits, particularly for medicinal properties in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standardized Ginkgo extract, EGb761, has been reported to protect neurons against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To characterize the oral consumption of EGb761 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, we performed the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) filament model in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO-1) knockouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were pretreated for 7 days before the transient occlusion or posttreated acutely during reperfusion; then neurobehavioral scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, primary cortical neuronal cultures were used to investigate the contribution of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme HO-1 in the EGb761-associated cytoprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice that were pretreated with EGb761 had 50.9+/-5.6% less neurological dysfunction and 48.2+/-5.3% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than vehicle-treated mice; this effect was abolished in HO-1 knockouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the prophylactic properties of EGb761, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posttreatment 5 minutes and 4.5 hours after reperfusion also led to significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After our previous demonstration that EGb761 significantly induced HO-1 levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner in neuronal cultures, here we revealed that this de novo HO-1 induction was required for neuroprotection against free radical damage and excitotoxicity as it was significantly attenuated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that EGb761 could be used as a preventive or therapeutic agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and suggest that HO-1 contributes, at least in part, to EGb761 neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
