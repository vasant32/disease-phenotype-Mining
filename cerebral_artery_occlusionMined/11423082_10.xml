<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of BMP-7 on functional recovery, local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCMRglu) following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague--Dawley rats (n=29) were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and received 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rectal and cranial temperatures were regulated at 37.0--37.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMP-7 or vehicle (volume, 25 microl) was administered intracisternally in a blinded fashion at 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated during occlusion (60 min) and daily for 2 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In matched animal groups, LCMRglu was measured autoradiographically with [(14)C]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (2-DG) and LCBF with [(14)C]iodoantipyrine 48 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four animals groups were studied: LCMRglu series (BMP-7, n=7; vehicle, n=8); LCBF series (BMP-7, n=6; vehicle, n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average three-dimensional image data sets were constructed for each group and were compared by pixel-based statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rectal and cranial temperatures, mean blood pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and blood gases were similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMP-7 significantly improved the total neurological score compared to vehicle at 48 h after MCAo (7.3+/-0.4 vs. 9.0+/-0.2, respectively; P&lt;0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared to vehicle-rats, BMP-7 enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in the basal ganglia ipsilateral to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and improved LCBF in ipsilateral subthalamus, but decreased LCBF and LCMRglu in contralateral cortical regions </plain></SENT>
