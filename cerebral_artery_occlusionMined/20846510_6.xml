<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much experimental evidence has proved that AST has the function of eliminating oxygen free radicals and can protect organisms from oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to further investigate the neuroprotective effect of AST on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced toxicity in primary culture of cortical neurons and on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion induced brain damage in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AST, over a concentration range of 250-1000nM, attenuated 50Î¼M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced cell viability loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>500nM AST pretreatment significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> measured by Hoechst 33342 staining and restored the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (MMP) measured by a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">Rhodamine 123</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, AST prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24h reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of AST intragastrically twice at 5h and 1h prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> dramatically diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological deficit in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining showed that the neuronal injury was significantly improved by pretreatment of AST at 80mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that pretreatment with AST exhibits noticeable neuroprotection against brain damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of AST maybe partly responsible for it </plain></SENT>
