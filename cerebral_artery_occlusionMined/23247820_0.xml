<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we subjected male Sprague-Dawley rats to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and investigated how post-ischemic administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> affected neurologic outcome and the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, just before reperfusion, the animals were randomly assigned to receive either <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (20 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) or vehicle (10 % intralipid, 2 ml kg(-1) h(-1)) intravenously for 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and brain water content were measured at different time points after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of bFGF was measured by real-time PCR, and the protein expression level of bFGF was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6, 24, 72 h, and 7 days of reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-treated group compared to that in the vehicle-treated group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> post-treatment also attenuated brain water content at 24 and 72 h and reduced neurologic deficit score at 72 h and 7 days of reperfusion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, bFGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were elevated at 6, 24, and 72 h of reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle-treated group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that post-ischemic administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> provides neural protection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This protection may be related to an early increase in the expression of bFGF </plain></SENT>
