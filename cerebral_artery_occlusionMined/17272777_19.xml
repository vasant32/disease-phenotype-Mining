<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients who receive tissue plasminogen activator have better outcome when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were taken before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 145 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the middle cerebral artery (who received tissue plasminogen activator treatment (&lt;3 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (40%) became functionally independent at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with good outcome were age (68 versus 74.4 years, P&lt;0.001), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (13 versus 18, P&lt;0.001), and proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (56.1% versus 84.3%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> were the only drug taken before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that conditioned neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, among patients who were functionally independent, 27.3% were under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> at the time of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with 13.6% among the group of patients who were dependent or dead by the end of the study period (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model identified baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;15 (OR: 5.8, 95% CI: 2.05 to 16.36, P=0.001), age &lt;70 years (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.13 to 7.59, P=0.027), and previous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (OR: 5.26, 95% CI: 1.48 to 18.72, P=0.027) as independent predictors of good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> at the moment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who received thrombolytics had an improved neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
