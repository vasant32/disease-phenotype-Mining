<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) is a critical downstream effector of Akt and a central regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether EGb 761 regulates Akt downstream targets, including mTOR, p70S6 kinase, and S6 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected at 24 hours after MCAO and the cerebral cortex regions were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that EGb 761 significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain injury induces a decrease in Akt up-stream target, PDK1 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6 kinase, and phospho-S6 are subsequently decreased in regions affected by ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, EGb 761 prevented injury-induced decreases in these protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that EGb 761 inhibits injury-induced decreases in the number of positive cells for phospho-p70S6 kinase and phospho-S6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study provide evidence that EGb 761 protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain injury by preventing injury-induced decreases in p70S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
