<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a rat model of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we (1) determined the effect of HS therapy on regional brain water content with T(1)- and T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (2) tested the hypothesis that HS therapy modulates the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and at 6 hr post-MCAO were treated with either continuous intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline (NS) or 7.5% HS for 18 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While lesion size measured on T(2)-weighted imaging did not differ between NS (580 +/- 217 mm(3); mean +/- SD) and HS (460 +/- 86 mm(3)) treatments, there was a correlation between T(2) values and tissue water content as determined by wet-to-dry ratio in the caudoputamen (CP) complex of ischemic core (r = 0.612, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in T(1) values with treatment in the ischemic cortex (NS: 2.08 +/- 0.13; HS: 1.78 +/- 0.20) and CP complex (NS: 2.09 +/- 0.14; HS: 1.77 +/- 0.22), but there was no correlation between T(2) values and regional brain tissue water content in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions and the non-ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in AQP4 protein expression in the ischemic hemisphere between NS and HS-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that (1) T(2)-weighted MRI imaging correlates with tissue water content in the ischemic core but not in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, and (2) attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> involves the modulation of AQP4 channels in the brain </plain></SENT>
