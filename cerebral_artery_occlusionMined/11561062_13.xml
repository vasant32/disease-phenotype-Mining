<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the effects of the N-acetylated-alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) inhibitor, GPI5232 [2-[(pentafluorophenylmethyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17859">pentanedioic acid</z:chebi>], to not only decrease brain injury but also to alter the inherent electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous i.v. infusion of GPI5232 starting 1 h after injury resulted in more than a 50% reduction in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume caused by 2 h of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was dose-dependent and significant even when first treatment was delayed for 2 h post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h post-MCAo, EEG spectral analysis of the injured hemisphere revealed functional improvement in GPI5232-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery in high-frequency EEG power (8-30 Hz) was measured in GPI5232-treated animals in both parietal and temporal brain regions but not in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAo-injured rats were also predisposed to developing cortical brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and GPI5232-treated rats had significantly fewer brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> than vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> high doses of GPI5232 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats did not significantly alter EEG brain activity as evaluated by spectral analysis and did not produce any signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity or behavioral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show GPI5232 to be an effective neuroprotective treatment when given postinjury by reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and ameliorating the pathological EEG associated with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
