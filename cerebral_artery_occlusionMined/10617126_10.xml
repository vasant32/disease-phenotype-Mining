<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that dehydroevodiamine.HCl (DHED) has anticholinesterase and antiamnesic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To verify the effects of DHED on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> further, we tested it on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> model of the rat using the passive avoidance and eight-arm radial maze tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single (20 mg/kg p.o.) and repeated (10 mg/kg p.o.) administrations of DHED could significantly reverse the latency time shortened by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg i.p.) to control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impaired spatial working memory induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg i.p.) was also improved significantly by a single injection (6.25 mg/kg i.p.) and repeated administrations of DHED (10 mg/kg p.o.) in the eight-arm radial maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the effects of DHED on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and the histological changes of the brain after unilateral electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> caused by EC lesion and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were improved significantly by repeated administrations of DHED (6.25 mg/kg i.p.) after EC lesion or ischemic insult once a day for 7 days in the passive avoidance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the DHED-treated group was notably reduced in the hippocampal area (CA1) of ischemic rats and in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal area (CA1 and CA3) of EC-lesioned rats compared with the nontreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infarction area was decreased significantly by a single administration of DHED (6.25 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before ischemic insult for 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DHED might be an effective drug for not only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> type, but also the vascular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
