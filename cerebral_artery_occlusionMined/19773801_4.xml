<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arginine-rich, mutated in early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (ARMET) is an ER stress-inducible protein and upregulated in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to investigate the characteristics and implications of ARMET expression induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a suture; ischemic lesions were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology; neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by TUNEL staining; the expressions of proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescent labeling, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ARMET was found to be extensively upregulated in ischemic regions in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of ARMET was neuronal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined structures in response to the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that ARMET expression is earlier and more sensitive to ischemic stimulation than C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ER stress agent tunicamycin induced ARMET and CHOP expressions in the primary cultured neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with recombinant human ARMET promoted neuron proliferation and prevented from neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by tunicamycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced ARMET expression may be protective to the neurons </plain></SENT>
