<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, cytokine, and leukocyte <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have rescued mainly neocortical neurons, indicating differences in the degenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was, therefore, to describe the microglial/macrophage activation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment patterns and to correlate these with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced degenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis showed significant differences in the characteristics and timing of the microglial/macrophage responses between the caudate putamen and neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones and their associated penumbral zones, as well as between the striatal and the neocortical penumbral zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltrations with polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones were limited and shortlasting and confined to the acutely degenerating striatum and piriform cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A delayed, massive infiltration with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phagocytes into the caudate putamen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> markedly contrasted an early recruitment and activation of microglia/macrophages in the adjacent penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the neocortex, a later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of degeneration along the insular-parietal axis was marked by neuronal expression of heat shock protein and a progressive microglial activation with induction of the full repertoire of microglial activation markers, including a widespread microglial major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We interpret the present results as delineating two differentially progressing penumbral zones, which are likely to reflect differences in the underlying degenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in the microglial/macrophage activation pattern attract special attention, as these cells may constitute specific targets for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
