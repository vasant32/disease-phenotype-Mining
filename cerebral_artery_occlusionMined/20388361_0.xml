<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 48 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into five groups: A (20 mg/kg LP), B (5 mg/kg LP), C (salad oil), D (salad oil) and E (basic feed control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A, B and C groups were given LP or salad oil orally for 15 d, then <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and D group was used as fake surgery control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> (LD) and the activities of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthetase (NOS) in cortex were measured at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of HIF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 mRNA in hippocampi were determined by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ROS levels of A, B, C, D and E groups were (114.23 +/- 18.91), (135.89 +/- 14.17), (171.37 +/- 25.76), (94.24 +/- 2.23) and (92.06 +/- 5.59) fluorescence intensity value/g protein, respectively (F = 9.038, P &lt; 0.01); levels of NO were (6.60 +/- 0.77), (7.13 +/- 0.47), (8.38 +/- 0.80), (5.52 +/- 0.16) and (5.23 +/- 0.51) micromol/g protein respectively (F = 10.197, P &lt; 0.01); levels of NOS were (0.817 +/- 0.016), (0.875 +/- 0.095), (1.030 +/- 0.101), (0.557 +/- 0.094) and (0.595 +/- 0.066) U/mg protein respectively (F = 14.555, P &lt; 0.01); levels of LD were (0.381 +/- 0.069), (0.446 +/- 0.012), (0.576 +/- 0.059), (0.359 +/- 0.021) and (0.310 +/- 0.036) mmol/g protein respectively (F = 10.043, P &lt; 0.01); HIF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in hippocampi were 0.865 +/- 0.274, 0.635 +/- 0.069, 0.491 +/- 0.067, 0.375 +/- 0.052 and 0.361 +/- 0.087, respectively (F = 40.520, P &lt; 0.01); and Bcl-2 mRNA expression levels in hippocampi were 0.263 +/- 0.033, 0.330 +/- 0.028, 0.198 +/- 0.034, 0.304 +/- 0.039 and 0.236 +/- 0.025, respectively (F = 11.003, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The protective effects of LP may be related with its abilities of decreasing ROS and LD cumulation, alleviating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and up-regulating the expression of protective genes </plain></SENT>
