<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether administration of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> medications in burst-suppressive doses-the gold standard of neuroprotection during neurovascular procedures-provides an additional protective effect under hypothermic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted the present study to answer this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) normothermic controls; 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> treatment (burst suppression); 3) induction of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C); and 4) induction of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> treatment (burst suppression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored using bilateral laser Doppler flowmetry and electroencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were quantified and recorded during daily neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed histologically after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">Methohexital</z:chebi> treatment, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by 32%, 71%, and 66%, respectively, compared with normothermic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> therapy provided the best functional outcome, which was not improved by additional <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-induced burst suppression is not required to achieve maximum neuroprotection under mild hypothermic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of protection afforded by <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> alone appears to be modest compared with that provided by mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
