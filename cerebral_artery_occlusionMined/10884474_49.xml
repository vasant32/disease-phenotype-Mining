<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reperfusion brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with a developing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> at the site of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">Proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> block nuclear factor-kappaB activation and provide anti-inflammatory effects in several animal models of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to establish its pharmacodynamics as a neuroprotection treatment and related effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 2 hours of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by means of the filament method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After either 22 or 70 hours of reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured and neurological function, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, and/or neutrophil and macrophage infiltration was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> was administered in a single intravenous bolus at 2 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the therapeutic window for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> was estimated by delaying treatment for 4 or 6 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-response analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 hours revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> neuroprotection approached 60%, and clinical evaluations showed significant improvements in neurological function and EEG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration at 24 hours was also significantly decreased in cortical and striatal infarcted tissue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delaying the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> treatment up to 4 hours continued to result in significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 72-hour injury model, infarction was reduced 40% by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi>, and significant improvements in neurological function and EEG recovery were again measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considerable reductions in both neutrophil and macrophage infiltration were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS519</z:chebi> mitigates infarction and improves neurological recovery in brain-injured rats, an effect in part caused by a reduction in the leukocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
