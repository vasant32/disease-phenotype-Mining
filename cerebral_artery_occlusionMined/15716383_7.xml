<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to establish whether the neuroprotection induced by STAZN persists with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> survival and to characterize STAZN's pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiologically regulated rats received a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture and were treated with either STAZN [four 0.6 mg/kg doses i.p. administered at 2 (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of recirculation), 4, 24, and 48 h; n = 16] or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> vehicle (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received sequential neurobehavioral examinations followed by quantitative neuropathology at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STAZN improved neurological deficits compared with vehicle controls, beginning within &lt;2 h of the first dose and persisting throughout a 30-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large cystic necrotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were common in vehicle-treated rats but infrequent in STAZN-treated rats, and noninfarcted forebrain tissue was increased on average by 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats administered 5 mg/kg STAZN i.v. in Solutol HS 15/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/saline vehicle, STAZN blood levels exhibited a biexponential decline, with an initial half-life of 28 min and a subsequent slow decay with half-life of approximately 7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STAZN tissue levels at 2 to 3 h were, on average, 2.5% of blood levels in forebrain, 56% in myocardium, and 41% in kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STAZN was concentrated in liver with initial concentrations averaging 5.2-fold above blood levels and a subsequent linear decline of 40% between 24 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results establish that STAZN confers enduring ischemic neuroprotection, has a long circulating half-life, and penetrates well into brain and other organs-characteristics favoring its potential therapeutic utility </plain></SENT>
