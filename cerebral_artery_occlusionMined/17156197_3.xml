<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins are involved in the process of adaptation to cellular stresses and environmental factors such as a change in oxygen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the identification and characterization of a recently cloned <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> domain protein termed Npas4 in ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using gene expression profiling following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we showed that the Npas4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is differentially expressed in ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The full-length gene was cloned from rat brain and its spatial and temporal expression characterized with in situ hybridization and Northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Npas4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is specifically expressed in the brain and is highly up-regulated in ischemic tissues following both focal and global cerebral ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong expression in the limbic system and thalamus, as well as in layers 3 and 5 in the cortex of the unchallenged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, Npas4 appears as a protein of approximately 100 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In brain samples, however, in addition to the 100 kDa band a specific 200 kDa immunoreactive band was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic challenge lead to a decrease in the 200 kDa form and a simultaneous increase in the 100 kDa immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for activation and/or deactivation of this protein in response to ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
