<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the protein products of two such chemokines; i.e. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) in the ischemic brain tissue following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1 alpha were detected by Northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), respectively, and the anatomic distribution of specific proteins was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA was not expressed in the brains of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats or rats sacrificed 2 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>6 h after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, weak expression of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was detected in the ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were expressed up to 48 h, and were markedly attenuated at 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rats subjected to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 immunoreactivity was diffusely expressed and localized to the ischemic area, and was most intense at 48 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells and macrophage-like cells expressed <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 protein in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of MIP-1 alpha immunoreactive cells were identical with activated astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and proteins are induced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They may have a role in promoting inflammatory and/or repair processes in the ischemic brain, possibly by attracting or modulating inflammatory cells in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
