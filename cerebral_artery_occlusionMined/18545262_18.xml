<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique for detecting metabolism indirectly through changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> ratios and T2(*) signal change during 'oxygen challenge' (OC, 5 mins 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During OC, T2(*) increase reflects <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, which is formed when metabolizing tissues take up oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here OC has been applied to identify tissue metabolism within the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In series 1 scanning (n=5), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed, followed by echo-planar T2(*) acquired during OC and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI, arterial spin labeling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxygen challenge induced a T2(*) signal increase of 1.8%, 3.7%, and 0.24% in the contralateral cortex, ipsilateral cortex within the PWI/DWI mismatch zone, and ischemic core, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2(*) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) map coregistration revealed that the T2(*) signal increase extended into the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion (3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In series 2 (n=5), FLASH T2(*) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps coregistered with histology revealed a T2(*) signal increase of 4.9% in the histologically defined border zone (55% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, located within the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion boundary) compared with a 0.7% increase in the cortical ischemic core (92% neuronal ischemic cell change, core <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oxygen challenge has potential clinical utility and, by distinguishing metabolically active and inactive tissues within hypoperfused regions, could provide a more precise assessment of penumbra </plain></SENT>
