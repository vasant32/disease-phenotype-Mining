<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study characterized the neuroprotective and behavioral effects of (3aS,6aS)-6a-naphtalen-2-ylmethyl-5-methyliden-hexahydro-cyclopenta[c]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35559">furan</z:chebi>-1-on (BAY 36-7620), a novel, selective and systemically active metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (mGlu)(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the rat, neuroprotective effects were obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> model (efficacy of 40-50% at 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/h, i.v. infusion during the 4 h following surgery); whereas in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, a trend for a neuroprotective effect was obtained after triple i.v. bolus application of 0.03-3 mg/kg, given immediately, 2 and 4 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic effects were mild and only obtained at doses which were considerably higher than those at which maximal neuroprotective efficacy was obtained, indicating that the neuroprotective effects are not a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAY 36-7620 protected against pentylenetetrazole-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> in the mouse (MED: 10 mg/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As assessed in rats, BAY 36-7620 was devoid of the typical side-effects of the ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (iGlu) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> phencyclidine and (+)-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24783">imine</z:chebi> (MK-801) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, BAY 36-7620 did not disrupt sensorimotor gating, induce phencyclidine-like discriminative effects or stereotypical behavior, or facilitate intracranial self-stimulation behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>stereotypies</z:hpo> and disruption of sensorimotor gating induced by <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48538">apomorphine</z:chebi> were not affected by BAY 36-7620, the compound attenuated some behavioral effects of iGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, such as excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001440'>grooming</z:mp> or licking, and their facilitation of intracranial self-stimulation behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that mGlu(1) receptor antagonism results in neuroprotective and anticonvulsive effects in the absence of the typical side-effects resulting from antagonism of iGlu receptors </plain></SENT>
