<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of noncontrast CT in the selection of patients to receive thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and to predict radiological and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eighty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were randomized 2:1 within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to receive intra-arterial recombinant prourokinase plus intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred fifty-four CT examinations were digitized to calculate early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> changes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, and hemorrhagic changes among the 162 patients treated as randomized (108 recombinant prourokinase-treated patients and 54 control patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT changes were correlated with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, angiographic clot location, collateral vessels, and outcome at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline CT scans, 120 (75%) of 159, showed early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline CT abnormality volume was not correlated with the baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score (r=-0.11) but was correlated weakly with the outcome (r=0.17, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with M2 occlusions, patients with M1 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions had significantly higher baseline NIHSS scores (P&lt;0.05), more basal ganglia involvement on CT, and larger hypodensity volumes on follow-up CTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with partial or no collateral supply, patients with full collateral supply had lower baseline NIHSS scores, significantly smaller baseline CT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, and less cortical involvement (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast CT is not correlated with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and does not predict outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, baseline CT changes, clinical presentation, and the evolution of CT changes are influenced by clot location and the presence of a collateral supply </plain></SENT>
