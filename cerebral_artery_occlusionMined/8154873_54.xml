<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We divided animals into three groups: MAb 1 group (n = 5)--rats were subjected to 2 hours of transient occlusion and 1B6c (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at 0 and 22 hours of reperfusion; MAb 2 group (n = 5)--same experimental protocol as MAb 1 group, except that the initial dose of 1B6c was increased to 2 mg/kg; and control group (n = 5)--same experimental protocol as MAb 2 group, except that an isotype-matched control antibody was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were weighed and tested for neurological function before and after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six hours after reperfusion, brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for histology evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improvement in neurological function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the MAb 2 animals compared to MAb 1 and vehicle-treated animals (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume was significantly smaller in the MAb 2 group (19.5 +/- 1.9%) compared to MAb 1 (29.9 +/- 2.6%) and vehicle-treated (34.2 +/- 5.4%) groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue polymorphonuclear cell numbers were reduced in both 1B6c-administered groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that administration of anti-CD11b antibody results in a dose-dependent, significant functional improvement and reduction of ischemic cell damage after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
