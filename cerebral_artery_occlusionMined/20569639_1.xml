<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were evaluated with emergency MRI and MRA before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial tandem <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> due to distal embolism was observed in nine patients, and contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt; 70%) was observed in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score of the patients was 15.4 +/- 7.4 (mean +/- SD) before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment modality included local intraarterial fibrinolysis (LIF), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>), and carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A protective balloon was successfully placed in the distal carotid artery through the plaque before recanalization in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients were treated with LIF+<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, five with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>+CAS, six with LIF+<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>+CAS, and one with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization of the carotid artery was obtained in 14 of the 15 patients, and distal tandem middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was also successfully recanalized in eight of the nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GOS was four or five in eight patients (good outcome group) and 1-3 in seven patients (poor outcome group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean NIHSS score of the 15 patients was (6.9 +/- 7.4) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative NIHSS score (10.3 +/- 7.4) in the good outcome group was significantly lower than that (21.3 +/- 5.4) in the poor outcome group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The protective balloon technique, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with stenting, seems to be useful for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> revascularization of urgent carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous treatment of the intracranial tandem occlusive lesion is essential to achieve good clini-cal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion with NIHSS scores of less than 16 could be good candidates for this advanced treatment </plain></SENT>
