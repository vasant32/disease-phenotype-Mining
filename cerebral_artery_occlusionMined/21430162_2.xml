<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The uptake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> into synaptic vesicles is mediated by the vesicular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> transporter (VGAT), and changes in the expression of the transporter directly regulate neurotransmitter release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work we investigated the changes in VGAT protein levels during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in excitotoxic conditions, which may affect the demise process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that VGAT is cleaved by calpains following excitotoxic stimulation of hippocampal neurons with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, giving rise to a stable truncated cleavage product (tVGAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VGAT cleavage was also observed after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model, and following intrahippocampal injection of kainate, but no effect was observed in transgenic mice overexpressing calpastatin, a calpain inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of isolated cerebrocortical synaptic vesicles with recombinant calpain also induced the cleavage of VGAT and formation of stable tVGAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot experiments using antibodies targeting different regions of VGAT and N-terminal sequencing analysis showed that calpain cleaves the transporter in the N-terminal region, at amino acids 52 and 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry of GABAergic striatal neurons expressing GFP fusion proteins with the full-length VGAT or tVGAT showed that cleavage of the transporter induces a loss of synaptic delivery, leading to a homogeneous distribution of the protein along neurites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that excitotoxicity downregulates full-length VGAT, with a concomitant generation of tVGAT, which is likely to affect GABAergic neurotransmission and may influence cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
