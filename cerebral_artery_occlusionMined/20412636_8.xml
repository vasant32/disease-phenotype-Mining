<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of systemic administration of rat or human bone marrow stromal stem cells (MSC) at early and later times following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on blood cytokines/growth factors, brain glia, and motor behavior in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were tail vein injected with rat (r) and human (h) MSCs at 1 or 7 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some rats (N = 4) MSCs isolated from transgenic GFP rats were used to track the migration of cells peripherally and centrally at 2.5 and 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor behavior was assessed using the modified Neurological Severity Score/climbing test at various time points before and after MCAO and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to sacrifice at 1, 7, or 28 days post-MCAO, blood serum was collected for cytokine array analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were analyzed for markers of activated microglia (CD11) and reactive astrocytes (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of either allogeneic (rMSCs) or xenogeneic (hMSCs) stem cells produced a significant recovery of motor behavior after MCAO, with cells delivered at 1 day having greater effect than those at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlated with recovery was an amplification in activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and new blood vessels in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, resulting in greater preservation in brain integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, expression of blood cytokines/chemokines (IL-13, MMP2, MIP) and growth factors/receptors (VEGF, neuropilin, EPOR, TROY, NGFR, RAGE) were modified following MSC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because only rare GFP-labeled MSCs were observed in the brain, these effects did not depend on the central incorporation of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The early systemic administration of allogeneic or xenogeneic MSCs soon after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> produces a structural/functional recovery in the brain which is correlated with an increase in activated brain glia and changes in circulating cytokines and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stem cells therefore induce an important neuroprotective and/or regenerative response in the host organism </plain></SENT>
