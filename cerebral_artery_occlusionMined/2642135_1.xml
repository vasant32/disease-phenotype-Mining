<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen adult cats (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group, 5; control group, 8) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic arterial pressure (SAP) was monitored continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was produced by a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the ectosylvian region was measured by a hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalogram (EEG) was monitored, and spectral power of the EEG was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pial artery pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) in the ectosylvian region was continuously recorded non-occlusively by a micropressure recording device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group, low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> was given normovolaemically from 10 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> to lower the haematocrit (Ht) to 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rCBF values in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group were significantly higher than in the control group after 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upstream resistance [(SAP-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>)/rCBF] was significantly lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, downstream resistance (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>/rCBF) was significantly lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group than in the control group at the 180-minute point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in the spectral power of the EEG during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Ht was significantly correlated with rCBF in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that haemodilution can improve rCBF by lowering the Ht and improving the microcirculation of collateral vessels via pial anastomoses, although it might have insufficient effect on improvement of cerebral function </plain></SENT>
