<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays important roles in the survival and recovery of some mature neurons under pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of GDNF in ameliorating ischemic brain injury has not been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated a possible effect of GDNF on the changes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, DNA fragmentation, and immunoreactivities for caspases after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the estimation of ischemic brain injury, we calculated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region and also measured the brain water content as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation at 24 hours after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for the detection of DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities for caspase-1 (ICE), caspase-2 (Nedd-2), and caspase-3 (CPP32) were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after permanent MCAO were significantly reduced by topical application of GDNF (48% and 30% decreases, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining and immunoreactivities for caspases were markedly induced at 12 hours after permanent MCAO in the vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the spatial distribution of those immunohistochemically positive cells was dissociative in each caspase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of TUNEL staining and immunoreactivities for caspases-1 and -3 was greatly reduced with GDNF treatment, whereas the reduction of caspase-2 staining was only minimum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> by GDNF was greatly associated with the reduction of DNA fragmentation and apoptotic signals predominantly through caspases-1 and -3 cascades </plain></SENT>
