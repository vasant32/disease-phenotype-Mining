<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although peripheral immune cells infiltrate ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue and elicit immune injury, the role of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) and the toxins they release in mediating neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granzyme-b (Gra-b), a serine protease found in the cytoplasmic granules of CTLs and natural killer cells, plays an important role in inducing target cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by activating several caspases and by initiating caspase-independent pathways that contribute to target cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if CTLs and Gra-b are involved in post-ischemic cerebral cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; we investigated the role of CD8(+) CTLs and Gra-b in ischemic rat brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) and in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that CTLs infiltrate the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> within 1 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in Gra-b levels in the ischemic region starting from 1 h until 3 day which correlated with increased levels of chemokines (IP-10/CXCL10, IL-2) and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Gra-b interacts with Bid, PARP, and caspase-3 in ischemic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis of Gra-b and TUNEL showed that Gra-b is present both in apoptotic and necrotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple immunostaining further confirmed that the Gra-b positive degenerating cells were neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CTLs in close spatial proximity to degenerating neurons, increased levels of Gra-b, localization in neurons positive for TUNEL, and interaction with other pro-apoptotic proteins indicate that Gra-b and CTLs play a significant role in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat brain after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the above findings we support our hypothesis that Gra-b secreted from activated CTLs might be involved in aggravating post-ischemic damage by mediating neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
