<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, commonly termed preconditioning, promotes ischemic tolerance and may involve mild activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in the affected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> (2 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-4) mg/kg) 30 min prior to a 4 h period of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in the insular region of rat prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This affect was blocked when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment was combined with a non-selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, or preceded by intracortical injection of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004052'>reduced renal sympathetic nerve activity</z:mp> as well as induction of resident endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated proteins 78 and 94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calcium-sensitive chaperone heat shock protein 70 and the cysteine protease m calpain did not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant induction of heat shock protein 70 was observed in the contralateral cortex of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> pretreated rats following 4 h of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> preconditioning promotes ischemic tolerance in the short term, in part via effects mediated through activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors, as well as through mild activation of cellular stress proteins </plain></SENT>
