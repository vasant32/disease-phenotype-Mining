<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> turnover was assessed by measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41941">3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor function, by measuring (3H)-Spiroperidol binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a transient decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41941">3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid</z:chebi> and permanent damage to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptors, as indicated by a time-dependent progressive reduction in the number of (3H)-Spiroperidol binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The receptor deficit also manifested as turning behaviour towards the lesioned side 4 weeks after the lesion following subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48538">apomorphine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
