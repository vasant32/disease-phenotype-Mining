<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used this marker to assess the neuroprotective activity of potential anti-ischaemic drugs belonging to several chemical classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In untreated mice, the mean infarcted volume measured 96 h after unilateral coagulation of the middle cerebral artery was 27.9 +/- 4.3 mm3 (17.5% of the hemisphere volume) and omega 3 site densities (measured by incubation with 3H-PK 11195) were increased by 107.3 +/- 4.8% (cortical homogenates) or by 81% (coronal brain sections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The administration of the anti-ischaemic agent SL 82.0715 (10 mg/kg i.p.), 5 min, 6 h and 18 h after the occlusion and then twice daily until sacrifice evoked a decrease of similar magnitude (ca </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The constant tissue sparing effect of SL 82.0715 allowed the examination of the window of therapeutic opportunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant diminution of cortical omega 3 sites was still noted when the first administration was delayed until 3 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the protective effect of SL 82.0715 was enhanced by repeated treatment for the first 36 h but not thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the histological, autoradiographic and homogenate binding results obtained with SL 82.0715, we studied the protective effects of several competitive and non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When administered according to the above-described standard protocol, these drugs reduced omega 3 site levels in cortical homogenates from MCAO mice in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dose preventing by 50% the increase in omega 3 site levels (in mg/kg i.p.) and the maximal inhibition were respectively: MK-801 (0.2, 93%); TCP (1.6, 66%); kynurenate (260, 58%); ifenprodil (7.0, 58%); SL 82.0715 (1.1, 72%); CGS 19755 (46% at 10 mg/kg); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4470">dextromethorphan</z:chebi> (46% at 30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, agents acting preferentially upon sigma (sigma) opiate receptors ((+)-3PPP, 1-10 mg/kg i.p. and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi>, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p.) did not provide a significant protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (nimodipine, flunarizine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35553">perhexiline</z:chebi>, diltiazem) were devoid of a clear neuroprotective potential when administered at non-toxic doses after the coagulation of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem (3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) provided a significant protection when the first administration was performed 10 min prior to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Limited protection was observed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 2-chloro-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
