<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The models with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reperfusion (MCAO/R) were established by inserting a micro-balloon catheter intra-arterially into <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> from femoral artery in 12 adult healthy monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NRG-1beta was injected into <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> from micro-balloon catheter in the animals of treatment group at 2 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> while the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was simultaneously injected in the animals of control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the micro-balloon catheter was withdrawn from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to perfuse for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> behavioral function was evaluated by task-oriented score and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured by TTC and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The animals of control group had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> functional disorders at 2 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and had no significant difference at reperfusion 22 h (59.8 +/- 15.7); the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function of monkeys had no improvement after NFG-1beta treatment (61.3 +/- 16.2) (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diffuse weight imaging (DWI) showed a high signal area but T(1) and T(2) imaging had no significant changes at 2 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in control group animals; while the T(1) and T(2) imaging showed a typical high signal areas, DWI high signal area expanded and TTC staining ischemic area appeared at reperfusion 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T(1), T(2) and DWI abnormal signal areas and TTC cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume did not shrink significantly in NFG-1beta treatment group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of NRG-1beta upon cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury needs to be further studied </plain></SENT>
