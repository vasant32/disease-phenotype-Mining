<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study we tested the protective effects of netrin-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and investigated the potential underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When we performed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on adult mice, up-regulation of the receptor uncoordinated gene 5H2 (UNC5H2) but not its ligand netrin-1 was detected with RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injection of netrin-1, 1 day after MCAO, significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 3 days after MCAO as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic cortex was preserved when netrin-1 was continuously administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling staining showed that netrin-1 reduced the number of dying neurons and apoptotic cells after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced p53 expression was attenuated by netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tested the ability of netrin-1 to attract intrinsic neuronal stem cells to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and UNC5H2 were expressed in neurosphere culture and netrin-1 attracted stem cells in an in vitro transwell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in vivo netrin-1 administration did not enhance the MCAO-induced stem cell migration toward the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that UNC5H2 expression was elevated after MCAO and administration of netrin-1 protected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue from p53-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the p53/dependent receptor pathway is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> pathology and suggest possible new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
