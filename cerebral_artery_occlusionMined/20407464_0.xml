<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animals and humans, these effects may be independent of the blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)) and hypertensive (spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)) animals were treated with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43755">lisinopril</z:chebi> for 7 or 42 days before 2 hours of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, serum ACE, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was recorded 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite greater reductions in blood pressure, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was not improved by ACE inhibition in hypertensive animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term ACE inhibition produced only a modest reduction in blood pressure, but WKY rats showed marked reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term ACE inhibition had additional reductions in blood pressure; however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in WKY rats did not improve further but worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WKY rats differed from SHR in having marked cortical ACE activity that was highly sensitive to ACE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in normotensive rats do not correlate with changes in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, WKY rats have <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi>-sensitive cortical ACE activity that is lacking in the SHR </plain></SENT>
