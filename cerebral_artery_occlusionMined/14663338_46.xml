<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity increases in the brain during the first day after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and might be involved in the pathogenesis of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed MMP-9 in the extracellular space of brain parenchyma along with neutrophil recruitment after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested whether neutrophils were a direct source of enhanced MMP-9 in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration was prevented either by injecting an antibody against ICAM-1, which abrogates neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the endothelial vessel wall, or by inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-hour intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion was induced, and studies were performed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating neutrophils expressed 95-kDa MMP-9 and dimers, and infiltrated neutrophils stained positive for MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP-9 (mainly 95-kDa proform and dimers and, to a lesser extent, 88-kDa form) increased in brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatments preventing neutrophil infiltration failed to preclude the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increase in 88-kDa MMP-9 form and gelatinase activity in neurons and blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these treatments prevented the major increase in 95-kDa MMP-9 form and dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neutrophil infiltration highly contributes to enhanced MMP-9 in the ischemic brain by releasing MMP-9 proform, which might participate in the tissular inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
