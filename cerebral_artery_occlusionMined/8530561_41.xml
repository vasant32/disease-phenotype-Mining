<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical CBF fell to 24 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and recovered to 84 +/- 16% during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels increased by 6.5-fold above baseline 10 min following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion but subsequently returned to near baseline levels in spite of the persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increase in 2,3- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17189">2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (DHBA) concentrations in the microdialysis perfusate was confirmed during both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the temporal profile and amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> hydroxylation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among individual animals, integrated 2,3-DHBA concentrations during reperfusion were correlated positively with integrated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and negatively with mean postischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These relationships suggest a possible association of the enhanced production of 2,3-DHBA during reperfusion with larger amounts of intraischemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and lower levels of post-ischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
