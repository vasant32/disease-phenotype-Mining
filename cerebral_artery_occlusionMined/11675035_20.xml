<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, was studied in male Wistar rats subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg i.p.) was administered four times in an animal at the time of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 1 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, at the time of reperfusion and 1 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours after reperfusion, rats were euthanized for estimation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers (malondialdehyde and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the raised level of malondialdehyde (287+/-28, 279+/-52 nmol/g wet tissue, respectively) as compared to the levels (420+/-61 nmol/g wet tissue) in vehicle-treated middle cerebral artery-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an insignificant change in levels of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> at these doses (95+/-42, 88.7+/-36 microg/g wet tissue, respectively) as compared to those in the vehicle-treated middle cerebral artery-occluded rats (108.21+/-21 microg/g wet tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was an insignificant difference between 20 and 40 mg/kg treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the dose of 20 mg/kg i.p. was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effect by using diffusion-weighted imaging (30 min after reperfusion), assessing the neurological deficit (24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) and estimating <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers (72 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 20 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated group, percent ischemic lesion volume on diffusion-weighted imaging was significantly attenuated (9.8+/-3.9) as compared to that in the vehicle-treated group (21.4+/-4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was significantly improved in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> group (1.8+/-0.06) as compared to that in the vehicle-treated (2.9+/-0.38) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of malondialdehyde (321.4+/-31 nmol/g wet tissue) and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (142.6+/-13 microg/g wet tissue) in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated group was also significantly decreased as compared to the level of malondialdehyde (623+/-22 nmol/g wet tissue) and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (226.6+/-19 microg/wet tissue) in the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> has a neuroprotective action in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which may be attributed to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property </plain></SENT>
