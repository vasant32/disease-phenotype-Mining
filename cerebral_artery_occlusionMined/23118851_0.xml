<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">Docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi>, a major omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, improves behavioral deficit and reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that DHA elicits neuroprotection by inducing AKT/p70S6K phosphorylation, which in turn leads to cell survival and protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in young and aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DHA, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) or vehicle (saline) was administered 3 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHA treatment improved functional recovery and reduced cortical, subcortical and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DHA also reduced microglia infiltration and increased the number of astrocytes and neurons when compared to vehicle on days 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increases in p473 AKT and p308 AKT phosphorylation/activation were observed in animals treated with DHA 4 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation of other members of the AKT signaling pathway were also observed in DHA treated animals including increases in pS6 at 4 h and pGSK at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DHA or NPD1 remarkably reduced total and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show that in young and aged rats DHA treatment after MCAo potentiates NPD1 biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of p308 AKT or pGSK was not different between groups in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, pS6 expression was increased with DHA or NPD1 treatment when compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that DHA induces cell survival, modulates the neuroinflammatory response and triggers long term restoration of synaptic circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both DHA and NPD1 elicited remarkable protection in aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, activation of DHA signaling might provide benefits in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> both acutely as well as long term to limit ensuing disabilities </plain></SENT>
