<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the deficits in a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess striatal function was highly correlated to the extent of ischemic damage determined by unbiased stereological estimations of striatal neuron numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The delivery of neurotrophins lead to mild functional improvements in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced motor impairments assessed 3-5 weeks after the insult, in agreement with a small but significant increase of the survival of dorsolateral striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed phenotypic analysis demonstrated that the parvalbumin-containing interneurons were spared to a greater extent by the neurotrophin treatment as compared to the projection neurons, which agreed with the specificity for interneuron transduction by the rAAV vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data show the advantage of the never previously performed combination of precise quantification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuropathology along with detailed behavioural analysis for assessing neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observe that intrastriatal delivery of NGF and BDNF using a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector system can mitigate, albeit only moderately, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which leads to detectable functional sparing </plain></SENT>
