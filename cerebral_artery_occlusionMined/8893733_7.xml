<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> has been routinely used as an adjunct in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has commonly been performed using a protocol of multiple short periods of occlusion alternating with periods of restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the logical basis of this method has come under scrutiny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is extensive experimental evidence to suggest that repetitive, brief periods of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may cause more severe cerebral injury than an equivalent single period of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only recently has this issue begun to be addressed with regard to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, despite the common use of temporary clipping, little experimental data are available regarding the ischemic consequences of temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> with periods of reperfusion versus uninterrupted temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate this issue, a protocol of occlusion/reperfusion that simulates the temporal profile that occurs during surgery was performed in a rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The animals in Group I underwent 60 minutes of uninterrupted middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the animals in Group II were subjected to six separate 10-minute occlusion periods with 5 minutes of reperfusion between occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis was performed 72 hours postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group I had significantly increased mean infarction volumes (50.0 +/- 12.1 mm3) compared to Group II (8.7 +/- 3.1 mm3) (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Injuries in Group I occurred in both the cortex and striatum, whereas Group II showed only striatal injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the extent of the injuries in Group II was less severe, characterized by ischemic neuronal injury rather than frank infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that intermittent reperfusion is neuroprotective during temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and support the hypothesis that intermittent reperfusion is beneficial if temporary clipping is required during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
