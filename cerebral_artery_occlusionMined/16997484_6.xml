<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Members of various transport protein families including ATP-binding cassette transporters and solute carriers were shown to be expressed in brain capillaries, choroid plexus, astrocytes or neurons, controlling drug and metabolite distribution to and from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are currently very limited on how the expression of these transport systems is affected by damage to the brain such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we studied the expression of four selected transporters, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (Mdr1a/b; Abcb1a/b), Mrp5 (Abcc5), Bcrp (Abcg2), and Oatp2 (Slc21a5) in a rat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transporter expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the periinfarcted region and protein localization and cellular phenotyping were done by immunohistochemistry and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> staining was detected in endothelial cells of disintegrated capillaries and by day 14 in newly generated blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference, however, in the Mdr1a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> amount in the periinfarcted region compared with the contralateral site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For Bcrp, a significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> up-regulation was observed from days 3-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation was followed by the protein as confirmed by quantitative immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oatp2, located in the vascular endothelium, was also up-regulated at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For Mrp5, an up-regulation was observed in neurons in the periinfarcted region (day 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the transport proteins were up-regulated with a maximum at day 14, a time point that coincides with behavioral recuperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study further suggests Bcrp as a pronounced marker for the regenerative process and a possible functional role of Mrp5 in surviving neurons </plain></SENT>
