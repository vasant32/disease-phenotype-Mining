<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> plasma membrane transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3 in the cerebral cortex of rats following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GAT-1 immunoreactivity exhibited minor changes and immunoblotting studies showed that the protein levels were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, GAT-3 immunoreactivity, which is normally expressed exclusively by distal astrocytic processes, was remarkably altered: (1) GAT-3-positive puncta were reduced in the perilesional cortex and disorganized in the remaining regions; (2) numerous GAT-3-positive cells were observed, mostly in the perilesional cortex; they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NeuN positive and most of them were identified as pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting studies showed that GAT-3 levels were not significantly altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal studies showed that virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GAT-3-positive neurons in the perilesional cortex were TUNEL negative and coexpressed heat shock protein 70 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> triggers a novel neuronal expression of GAT-3 that is greatest in the perilesional cortex and may contribute to the reported reduction in GABAergic inhibition </plain></SENT>
