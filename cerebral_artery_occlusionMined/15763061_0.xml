<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis against brain damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine SD rats were randomly divided into five groups, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, sham operation group, model group, electro-acupuncture group and low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis group (LLLI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) model was established by thread embolism of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats in the LLLI group, as well as the electro-acupuncture group were given treatment as soon as the occlusion finished (0 hour) and 12, 24 hours after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed the changes of neurological deficit scores and the body weight of the rats at different time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in the ratos brain tissue were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological deficit score of the LLLI group was significantly lower than that of the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The body weight and the activity of SOD of the rats decreased slightly, and the content of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> decreased significantly after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis can prevent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of its mechanisms may be increasing the activity of SOD and decreasing the damage of the oxidation products to the body </plain></SENT>
