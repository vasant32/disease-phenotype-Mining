<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of damage was evaluated in vivo 1 day later by quantitative MRI, and 7 days later by measuring the activities of neuronal marker enzymes <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase and glutamic acid decarboxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Striatal damage assessed using the three approaches was highly correlated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI was more reproducible than the enzymatic methods and was faster and simpler than histologic examination for routine analysis of excitotoxic damage and cerebroprotection in vivo in a pharmaceutical research environment </plain></SENT>
