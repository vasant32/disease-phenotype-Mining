<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that immunotherapy directed against the protein Nogo-A leads to recovery on a skilled forelimb reaching task in rats after sensorimotor cortex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which correlated with axonal and dendritic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy as an intervention to improve performance on a spatial memory task in aged rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and whether cognitive recovery was correlated with structural plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aged rats underwent a unilateral distal permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and one week later were treated with an anti-Nogo-A or control antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine weeks post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, treated rats and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aged rats were tested on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following testing rats were sacrificed and brains processed for the Golgi-Cox method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells were examined for dendritic length and number of branch segments, and CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells were examined for spine density and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy given one week following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged rats improved performance on the reference memory portion of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this improved performance was not correlated with structural changes in the hippocampal neurons examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding of improved performance on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> in aged rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treatment with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy demonstrates the promising therapeutic potential for anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of sites of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the aged brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treatment with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy is still under investigation </plain></SENT>
