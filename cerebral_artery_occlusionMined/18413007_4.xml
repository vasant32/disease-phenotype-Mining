<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10 each): hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, saline and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals in the hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> and saline groups were haemodiluted until haematocrit decreased to 30% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another experiment male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10 each): HES30, HES25 and HES20 and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats in the HES30, HES25 and HES20 groups were haemodiluted with hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> until the haematocrit decreased to 30%, 25% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 15 min after haemodilution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the rats were subjected to a right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Haemodilution with hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> improved neurologic outcome (P &lt; 0.01) and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P &lt; 0.01) compared to saline and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haemodilution with saline augmented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores in HES30 and HES25 groups were significantly lower compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05) while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in controls and HES20 were significantly larger compared to HES30 and HES25 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> normovolaemic haemodilution with a novel hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (130/0.4) reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improves neurological outcome after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by haemodilution was highest at haematocrit dilution between 25% and 30%, while ischaemic injury was exacerbates when haematocrit was diluted to 20% </plain></SENT>
