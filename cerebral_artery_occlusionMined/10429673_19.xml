<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As Factor IXa is a key intermediary in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, targeted inhibition of Factor IXa-dependent coagulation might inhibit microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without impairing extrinsic hemostatic mechanisms that limit <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A competitive inhibitor of native Factor IXa for assembly into the intrinsic Factor X activation complex, Factor IXai, was prepared by covalent modification of the Factor IXa active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a modified cephalin clotting time assay, in vivo administration of Factor IXai caused a dose-dependent increase in time to clot formation (3.6-fold increase at the 300 micrograms/kg dose compared with vehicle-treated control animals, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice given Factor IXai and subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion demonstrated reduced microvascular fibrin accumulation by immunoblotting and immunostaining, reduced 111In-labeled platelet deposition (42% decrease, P &lt; 0.05), increased cerebral perfusion (2.6-fold increase in ipsilateral blood flow by laser doppler, P &lt; 0.05), and smaller cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than vehicle-treated controls (70% reduction, P &lt; 0.05) based on triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining of serial cerebral sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At therapeutically effective doses, Factor IXai was not associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, as opposed to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, both of which significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factor IXai was cerebroprotective even when given after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, indicating that microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> continues to evolve (and may be inhibited) even after primary occlusion of a major cerebrovascular tributary </plain></SENT>
