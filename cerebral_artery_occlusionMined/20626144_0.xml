<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham-operation, model and electroacupuncture (EA) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a piece of thread <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (4 Hz/20 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Neiguan" (PC 6) for 30 min, once daily for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLUT-1 expression in the hippocampus was detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the treatment, compared with the sham-operation group, the expression of GLUT-1 in microvascular endothelial cells of the hippocampus in model group shown by both histochemical and Western blot techniques decreased apparently (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While in comparison with model group, the expression of GLUT-1 in EA group was upregulated significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of PC 6 can effectively upregulate GLUT-1 expression in the hippocampus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving CI by raising the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transportation of microvascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
