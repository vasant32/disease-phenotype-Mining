<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the influence of low-dose alcohol consumption on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice and a potential mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of low-dose alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: C57BL/6 J mice were fed a liquid diet without or with 1% alcohol for 8 weeks, orally treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg/day), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, or GW9662 (3 mg/kg/day), a selective PPARγ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice were subjected to unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain injury, DNA fragmentation and nuclear PPARγ protein/activity were evaluated at 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the brain injury and DNA fragmentation were reduced in 1% alcohol-fed mice compared to nonalcohol-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> suppressed the brain injury in nonalcohol-fed mice, but didn't alter the brain injury in alcohol-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GW9662 worsened the brain injury in alcohol-fed mice, but didn't alter the brain injury in nonalcohol-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear PPARγ protein/activity at peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the contralateral corresponding areas of the parietal cortex was greater in alcohol-fed mice compared to nonalcohol-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using differentiated catecholaminergic (CATH.a) neurons, we measured dose-related influences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcohol exposure on nuclear PPARγ protein/activity and the influence of low-dose alcohol exposure on 2-hour oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)/24-hour reoxygenation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that low-dose alcohol exposure increased nuclear PPARγ protein/activity and protected against the OGD/reoxygenation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of low-dose alcohol exposure on OGD/reoxygenation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was abolished by GW9662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> consumption of low-dose alcohol protects the brain against I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of low-dose alcohol consumption may be related to an upregulated PPARγ </plain></SENT>
