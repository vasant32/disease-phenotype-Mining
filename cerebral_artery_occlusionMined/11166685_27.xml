<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One approach to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> problem is to attach the nontransportable <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> to a brain targeting vector, which is a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> or peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody (MAb), that is transported into brain from blood via an endogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> transport system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies describe a conjugate of BDNF and the OX26 monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the transferrin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> technology is used to link the BDNF and the MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface of the BDNF is conjugated with 2000 Da <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> at carboxyl residues to optimize the plasma pharmacokinetics of the neurotrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult rats subjected to 24 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were treated intravenously with either unconjugated BDNF, unconjugated MAb, or the BDNF-OX26 conjugate at a dose of 1, 5 and 50 microg/rat of the BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These doses decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 6% (not significant), 43% (P&lt;0.01), and 65% (P&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was still observed if the administration of the BDNF conjugate was delayed for 1-2 h after MCAO, although the pharmacological effect was progressively diminished in proportion to the time delay between MCAO and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that large reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume can be achieved with the noninvasive intravenous administration of neurotrophins such as BDNF, providing the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is conjugated to a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> drug targeting system </plain></SENT>
