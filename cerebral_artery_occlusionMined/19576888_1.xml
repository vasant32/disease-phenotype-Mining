<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GIF-0173 was administered intravenously immediately following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model of rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes were examined at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry for 1 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cultured cortical neurons obtained from 1-day-old rats, the effects of GIF-0173 on the excitotoxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GIF-0173 improved neurological scores and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a dose-dependent manner following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But GIF-0173 did not improve CBF after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GIF-0173 also prevented <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cellular swelling in primary cultures in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it inhibited neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GIF-0173 dose-dependently suppressed the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i), but could not inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced calcium influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of GIF-0173 against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase were reversed by addition of non-specific <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2)) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and were comparable to the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) DP1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, which prevented [Ca(2+)](i) increase and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GIF-0173 reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and protects cultured neurons against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity by inhibiting [Ca(2+)](i) increase through DP1 receptor activation </plain></SENT>
