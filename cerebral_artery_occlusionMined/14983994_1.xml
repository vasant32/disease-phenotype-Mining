<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of its action have not been fully defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate whether NXY-059 exerts its protective effects by inhibiting the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, a key initiator of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway, we have studied the effects of NXY-059 on reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and on inhibiting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release from the mitochondria after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hr of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and perfusion-fixed after 4, 6, 12, and 24 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 (30 mg/kg) was i.v. injected 1 hr after reperfusion and followed immediately by 30 mg/kg/hr continuous i.v. infusion for the entire reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NXY-059 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 37.2% to 12.5% (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> increased at 6 hr, peaked at 12 and 24 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 treatment prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 may reduce ischemic brain damage through suppressing the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway that is initiated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
