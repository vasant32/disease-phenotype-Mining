<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery is difficult and endovascular options may be limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 57-year-old woman presented with a right ganglionic parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to a ruptured lenticulostriate artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with ipsilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and parent feeding artery were occluded using endovascular injection of N-butyl cyanoacrylate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully obliterated and although some glue did enter the more distal middle cerebral artery, there was no change in the patient's neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected cases where lenticulostriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> cannot be directly accessed for surgery or endovascular coiling, obliteration with liquid acrylic glue may be considered as a therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
