<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during a 90-min period of reperfusion: 90/NORM, 90 min of normotensive reperfusion; 90/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>, 90 min of hypertensive reperfusion (MABP increased by 30 mm Hg); or 15/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>, the 90-min period of reperfusion was divided into 30 min of normotension, followed by 15 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 45 min of normotension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of reperfusion, 100 microCi kg-1 of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine was given and an autoradiographic analysis of CBF performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the coronal brain section at the center of middle cerebral artery distribution, the area (percentage of hemisphere, mean +/- SD) with a CBF of 0-20 or 21-40 ml 100 g-1 min-1 was less (p less than 0.05) in the 15/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> group (1 +/- 2 and 5 +/- 3%, respectively) versus the 90/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> group (12 +/- 4 and 10 +/- 4%), which was in turn less than in the 90/NORM group (18 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the hypothesis that during reperfusion a short interval of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> effectively augments CBF via an abrupt opening of collapsed vessels and that a more sustained interval of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> conveys no added benefit </plain></SENT>
