<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several investigators have demonstrated changes in extracellular Ca ionic activity consistent with Ca movement into cells, direct and quantitative evidence for Ca entry into ischemic cells is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure the regional distribution of tissue Ca contents of rat brains sampled at 2, 4, and 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 hours after MCAo, Ca concentrations increased significantly (p less than 0.005) in the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory, i.e., the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, but not in the surrounding brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, Ca concentrations in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortex were respectively 30.79 (+/- 2.90) and 29.19 (+/- 3.28) mumol/g dry tissue wt compared with 11.9 (+/- 1.7) mumol/g in sham-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue Ca concentration changes in the parasagittal cortex and basal ganglia adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site were much smaller and did not differ significantly from controls until 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory, greater than 1.0 mumoles of Ca entered per gram of dry tissue weight per hour during the first 4 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.9722) between changes in tissue Ca and water, with a slope indicating that 5.88 mumoles of Ca accompanied each milliliter of water entering the lesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such massive accumulations of Ca not only confirm Ca entry into injured cells, but indicate the presence of a remarkable Ca sink which sequestered within 24 hours more than 17 times the amount of free Ca present in the tissue before MCAo </plain></SENT>
