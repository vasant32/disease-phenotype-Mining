<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An impedance method was applied to evaluate transcellular fluid shifts in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The admittances (apparent electrical conductivities) of tissues were measured at varied frequencies based on a simple model of an electrical equivalent circuit for tissues, which consisted of Re (resistivity of extracellular fluid), Ri (resistivity of intracellular fluid) and Cm (capacitance of cell membrane) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calculated were Re, Ri, Rinf (resistivity of total fluid), Re/Ri and alpha (Cole-Cole distribution index) of brain tissue by Cole-Cole an arc of a circle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> induced by cat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the parameters were examined continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After MCAO, cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased to under 10 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then Re and Re/Ri increased, but Ri decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that fluid shift from extracellular (EC) to intracellular (IC) space occurred after ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rinf showed no changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of 30 min, which demonstrated no changes of total fluid volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this impedance technique, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_106'>fluid accumulation</z:mpath> and shift may be examined by changes of Re, Ri, Re/Ri and Rinf in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
