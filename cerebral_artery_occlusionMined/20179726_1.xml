<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible mechanism and the neuroprotective effect of human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with HUK (20 PNAU/g per day, intravenous) or saline as control, from the beginning of reperfusion to 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and BWC were measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes of brain were observed by TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory factors were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of MAPKs, Akt, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was detected by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that HUK significantly improved neurofunction, decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> as compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HUK inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway and activated the MAPK/ERK pathway in this neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
