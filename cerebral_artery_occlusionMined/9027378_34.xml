<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured the time-dependent morphological changes of microglial cells reacting to ischemic cell damage after transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat by means of lectin histochemistry with the B4-isolectin from Griffonia simplicifolia as well as immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies directed against monocyte/microphage (ED1) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (OX-6) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As early as 1 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion, microglia were absent in the severely neuronal damaged preoptic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, ameboid-like microglia were evident in an adjacent area containing scattered shrunken neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rod, round and ameboid-like microglia were present in the ischemic lesion between 2 to 10 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Round and ameboid cells became predominant in the ischemic core lesion and were mingled with highly ramified microglia to the boundary at 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highly ramified microglia were found in an adjacent area containing morphologically intact neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Round and ameboid cells were localized to the inner boundary of the ischemic lesion surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone at 46 of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Round and ameboid cells were present throughout the entire ischemic lesion in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone from 70-166 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in number and in intensity of highly ramified microglial cells were present in the outer boundary of the lesion during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant increase in both ED1- and OX-6-immunoreactive cells in the ischemic region was detected after 10 h of reperfusion and persisted up to 166 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that microglia exhibit a time dependent change in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> after reperfusion and that the severity of injury may be reflected in the state of microglial activation </plain></SENT>
