<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: sham operation group undergoing sham operation; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) group undergoing thread embolism of the left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to cause focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 2 hours and then undergoing reperfusion; and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group undergoing peritoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> 2 hours before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the rats in the 3 groups were re-divided into subgroups of 5 rats, totally 18 subgroups, to be decapitated 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours after reperfusion for the latter 2 groups, and their brains were taken out and fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the translocation of NF-kappaB in the neurons and the expression of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was used to detect the expression of NF-kappa B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The opposite non-ischemic cortexes were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two to 24 hours after the reperfusion NF-kappaB was significantly translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus; however, NF-kappa B remained in the cytoplasm of bilateral cortexes in the sham operation groups, and the nonischemic cortexes in the I/R and protofol groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The translocation of NF-kappa B from cytoplasm into nucleus was significantly inhibited in the ischemic cortex of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression values of NF-kappa B in the nuclei of ischemic cortexes in the I/R group 2 to 24 hours after reperfusion were significantly higher than those in the sham operation group and the nonischemic cortexes of the I/R and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression values of NF-kappa B in the ischemic cortex of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group 2 to 24 hours after reperfusion was significantly lower than that of the I/R group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression values of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 in the ischemic cortexes were significantly higher than that in the cortex of the sham operation group and those in the nonischemic cortexes of the I/R group and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05) and the expression values of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly lower than those in the I/R group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> inhibits the inflammatory reaction by inhibiting the NF-kappa B activation during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion which may be one of the mechanisms of its neuroprotective function </plain></SENT>
