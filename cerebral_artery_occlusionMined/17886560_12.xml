<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Neurogenesis continues throughout the life of mammals in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors tested the potential of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) acting via the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) in promoting the proliferation of adult rat neural progenitor cells (NPCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in spontaneously hypertensive rats by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substance P and the NK1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> L-703,606 were infused into the lateral ventricles of rats by using Alzet osmotic minipumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progenitor cell proliferation was evaluated with immunostaining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and immature neural marker doublecortin (DCX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurospheres were cultured from the SVZ of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under in vitro conditions, SP (0.01-10 micromol/L) increased the proliferation of cultured NPCs, with a peak increase of 52 +/- 7% at 0.1 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Substance P (0.1 micromol/L) continuously increased NPC proliferation from 6 hours to 5 days, which was prevented by L-703,606 (by 69-98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cultured NPCs expressed both SP and NK1R proteins, indicating that these effects are receptor specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continuous infusion of SP (1 micromol/L) into the lateral ventricles for 5 days significantly increased the number of proliferating NPCs (cells positive for both BrdU and DCX) in both the SVZ (by 173 +/- 24%, p &lt; 0.05) and DG (by 82 +/- 12%, p &lt; 0.05) in adult rats; however, infusion of L-703,606 (10 micromol/L) significantly prevented the postischemic induction of NPC proliferation in both the SVZ (by 84 +/- 6%, p &lt; 0.05) and DG (by 63 +/- 7%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data in these studies indicated that SP plays a role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis in the adult brain and thus could help central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system plasticity following injury </plain></SENT>
