<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TO901317 promotes synapse plasticity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without TO901317 starting 24 h after MCAo daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage and regeneration were evaluated by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TO901317 significantly increased synaptophysin expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo>, as well as decreased the expressions of amyloid betaA4 precursor protein and Nogo receptor (NgR) in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test whether TO901317 regulates the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) and Akt (p-Akt) activity in the ischemic brain, MCAo mice were treated with or without TO901317 starting 24 h after MCAo daily for 4 days and were then killed at 5 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TO901317 treatment significantly increased p-PI3K and p-Akt activity, but did not increase total PI3K expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using primary cortical neuron (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi>) culture, TO901317 significantly increased synaptophysin expression, p-PI3K activity, and decreased NgR expression compared with nontreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TO901317 also significantly increased neurite outgrowth, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 decreased neurite outgrowth in both controls and TO901317-treated groups in cultured hypoxic <z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that TO901317 promotes synaptic plasticity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo>, and that PI3K/Akt signaling activity contributes to neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
