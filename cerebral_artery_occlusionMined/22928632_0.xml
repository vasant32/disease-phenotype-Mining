<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> have both ischemic and hemorrhagic components, but most studies of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> only address the ischemic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is likely because investigations of hemorrhagic transformation are hindered by the lack of methods based on unbiased principles for volume estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We evaluated different methods for estimating the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An experimental thromboembolytic rat model was used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats underwent surgery and were placed in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was treated with saline, and group 2 was treated with 20â€‰mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stereology, semiautomated computer estimation, and manual erythrocyte counting were used to test the precision and efficiency of determining the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> when comparing the three methods of volume estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although semiautomated computer estimation and manual erythrocyte counting provided similar results as the stereological measurements, the stereological method was the most efficient and advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that stereology was the superior method for quantification of hemorrhagic volume, especially for rodent petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, which is otherwise difficult to measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the possibility of measuring both the ischemic and the hemorrhagic components of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, two parameters that may be differentially regulated when therapeutic regimens are tested </plain></SENT>
