<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the impact of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> on development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> 6, 24, and 72 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mutant mice that lack the ability to generate nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> from neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjacent coronal sections passing through the anterior commissure were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting was used to identify changes in the anti- and proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of caspases was assessed by appearance of actin cleavage products using a novel antiserum directed against 32-kDa actin fragment (fractin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase mutant mouse, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and TUNEL positive apoptotic neurons were reduced compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6 h, Bcl-2 levels in the ischemic hemisphere were increased in mutants but decreased in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bax levels did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase-mediated actin cleavage appeared in the ischemic hemisphere at this time point, and was significantly less in mutant brains at 72 h compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the number of TUNEL and fractin positive apoptotic cells appears far greater than anticipated based on the smaller lesion size in mutant mice.Hence, from these data we suggest that a deficiency in neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production slows the development of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after ischemic injury and is associated with preserved Bcl-2 levels and delayed activation of effector caspases </plain></SENT>
