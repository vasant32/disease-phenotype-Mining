<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated tissue <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> concentrations from wet and dry weight measurements and determined Na and K concentrations by atomic absorption spectroscopy in these areas of rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were analyzed at 2, 4, and 24 hours after MCAo and sham MCAo, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values measured in unoperated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the pyriform and frontoparietal areas, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> concentrations increased to 34 and 7% greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by 2 hours, and 89 and 94% by 24 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Na concentrations rose in these areas to 73 and 37% greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by 2 hours, and 281 and 330% by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K concentrations did not change until 4 hours, but fell to 62 and 34% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in these areas by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such large ion shifts indicate severe tissue destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the parasagittal cortex and basal ganglia areas, the ion and water changes were smaller and did not become significant until 24 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rates of Na entry into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site were greatest at 0-2 hours, while the rates of K loss peaked later, between 2 and 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in Na influx and K efflux resulted in net ion shifts that correlated highly with water entry, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.992 (p less than 0.001) and a slope indicating that 1 ml of water entered the tissue with each 145 mumoles of ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that net ion shifts cause the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
