<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We adopted the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in aged rats as the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model, with 3-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 12-day reperfusion, and observed the changes of the nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution and the expressions of NF-kappaB, heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and NOSs in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution, the expressions of NF-kappaB, HSP70, neuronal nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) in the untreated group were higher than those of the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution, the expressions of NF-kappaB, iNOS and nNOS were lower, while the expressions of HSP70 and eNOS were higher in the high-, medium- and low-dose Naomaitong-treated groups and nimodipine-treated group than those of the untreated-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nerve dysfunction score and the expression of nNOS were lower, while the expression of eNOS was higher in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the nimodipine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of HSP70 and eNOS were higher, while the other indices were lower in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the low-dose Naomaitong-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Naomaitong Recipe can protect the brain cells from damage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury by adjusting the expressions of NF-kappaB, HSP70 and NOSs, and the medium-dose Naomaitong Recipe is more effective </plain></SENT>
