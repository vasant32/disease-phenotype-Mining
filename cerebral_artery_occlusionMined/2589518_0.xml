<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow increased significantly by 75%, except in the flow-restricted cortex where flow averaged 28 +/- 15 (SD) ml.min-1.100 g-1 in control and 34 +/- 33 ml.min-1.100 g-1 in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant regional structural differences were observed within the microvascular beds of the two groups </plain></SENT>
