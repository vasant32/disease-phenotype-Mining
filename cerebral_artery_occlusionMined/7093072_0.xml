<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in cats, the effect of delayed administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>) and a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> derivative (Nizofenone or Y-9179) on the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rCBF was measured for one week by the hydrogen clearance technique without anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall effects of these drugs on histological changes were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four animals, in which <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> electrodes were chronically implanted in the ten predetermined positions, were divided into following three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> and Y-9179 groups received the vehicle, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> (25 mg/kg/day) and Y-9179 (6.25 mg/kg/day), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug administration was started 30 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and continued for three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the affected hemisphere of the animals which survived for one week, histological examination revealed ischemic lesions composed of the marginal, reactive and central zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infarction ratio calculated as the ratio of the damaged area to the whole hemispheric area was significantly smaller in the drug treated groups than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Y-9179 group, the reduction of the area comprizing the central and reactive zones was particularly prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no apparent differences in the time-course of the rCBFs between the control and Y-9179 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each channel showed reduction of the rCBF following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although slight fluctuations of the rCBF were seen during the first three to four hours, the initially dropped rCBF remained stable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> group, on the other hand, an increase of the rCBF took place following the administration of the drug in the area where the rCBF was initially reduced less than about 40 ml/100g/min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of the electrodes showing such an increase in the rCBF topographically corresponded to the reactive or boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the control group, vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> characterized by the perivascular exudation of plasma fluid was prominent in the periphery of the central zone as well as in the inner layer of the reactive zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Such changes were almost absent in the Y-9179 group, whereas it was more evident and close to the control in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>So far as the correlation between the course of the rCBF and the final histological outcome was examined, there was no evidence indicating the beneficial effect of the redistribution of the rCBF by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Y-9179 had no significant action on the course of the rCBF but its anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> effect might be related to its cerebral protective action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of cerebral protection by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> or Y-9179 needs further clarification </plain></SENT>
