<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the basement membrane, and not the endothelial cells, is vulnerable to ischemic/reperfusion injury with tPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated a spontaneously hypertensive rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with vehicle alone, tPA alone, or a free radical scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, plus tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopic analyses of each microvascular component revealed that the basement membrane disintegrated and became detached from the astrocyte endfeet in tPA-treated animals that showed HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> prevented the dissociation of the neurovascular unit, dramatically decreased the HT, and improved the neurologic score and survival rate of the tPA-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the basement membrane that underlies the endothelial cells is a key structure for maintaining the integrity of the neurovascular unit, and a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavenger can be a viable agent for inhibiting tPA-induced HT </plain></SENT>
