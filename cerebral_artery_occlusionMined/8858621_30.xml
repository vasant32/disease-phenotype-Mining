<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from light and electron microscopic studies were compared with those from a neonatal model of excitotoxic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in which classical apoptotic changes were seen in a subpopulation of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 6 and 24 h following occlusion, cells were either swollen or dark and shrunken showing a disordered cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h survival a high number of cells in the lesion core and lesion border showed internucleosomal DNA breaks, which were detected in sections using terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end-labelling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of cells with TUNEL positive spherical structures of condensed chromatin in the lesion core showed an advanced stage of cellular disintegration as opposed to an apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of a subpopulation of cells with chromatin condensation in the cortex and mammillary body of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) treated neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> internucleosomal DNA fragmentation associated with chromatin condensation is a late consequence of ischaemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rather than a hallmark of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
