<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the characterization of neuroprotection by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), the signaling pathway mediating its protective effect is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bad is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and is inactivated on phosphorylation via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study attempted to address whether MAPK signaling and Bad phosphorylation were influenced by TGF-beta1 and, furthermore, whether these two events were involved in the antiapoptotic effect of TGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a gradual activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and MAPK-activated protein kinase-1 (also called Rsk1) and a concomitant increase in Bad phosphorylation at Ser(112) in mouse brains after adenovirus-mediated TGF-beta1 transduction under nonischemic and ischemic conditions induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these effects, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increase in Bad protein level and caspase-3 activation were suppressed in TGF-beta1-transduced brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, DNA fragmentation, ischemic lesions, and neurological deficiency were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cultured rat hippocampal cells, TGF-beta1 inhibited the increase in Bad expression caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 concentration- and time-dependently activated Erk1/2 and Rsk1 accompanied by an increase in Bad phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were blocked by U0126, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase 1/2 inhibitor, suggesting an association between Bad phosphorylation and MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, U0126 and a Rsk1 inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38912">Ro318220</z:chebi>) abolished the neuroprotective activity of TGF-beta1 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, indicating that activation of MAPK is necessary for the antiapoptotic effect of TGF-beta1 in cultured hippocampal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, we demonstrate that TGF-beta1 suppresses Bad expression under lesion conditions, increases Bad phosphorylation, and activates the MAPK/Erk pathway, which may contribute to its neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
