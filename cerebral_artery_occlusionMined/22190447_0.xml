<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal mucosal damage not only induces local and systemic inflammatory reactions but may also result in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organ dysfunction syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the changes in serum ghrelin and small intestinal motility occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat models were produced by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MCAO group was further equally divided into five subgroups at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr, and the sham operated rats were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum ghrelin level was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and small intestinal motility was measured by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ileum tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurologic scores were 0 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the rats in the control group and 2-3 for those in the MCAO group, suggesting that rat models were established successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the impelling force in MCAO rats was significantly lower than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05), reaching the lowest level at 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Damage to the intestinal mucosa, including villus intestinalis, vacuolar degeneration of organelles, widened cell-cell junctions, and apoptotic cells could be found under the light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that higher level of serum ghrelin decreased gastrointestinal motility and damage to the intestinal mucosa existed in rats with MCAO </plain></SENT>
