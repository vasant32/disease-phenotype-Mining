<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After short periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, commonly used staining methods yield only moderate differences in optical contrast between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and damaged brain tissue when gray-scale images are used for computer-assisted image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a high-contrast silver <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> staining (SIS) method that allows an early delineation of ischemic tissue as soon as 2 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rat brain cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to permanent MCAO for 2, 4, 6, and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optical densities were quantified in nonischemic white and gray matter and in damaged tissue from gray-scale images of serial sections with the use of a video camera-based image analyzing system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SIS, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, Nissl, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> stainings were performed in cryosections, and 2,3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was performed in unfrozen vibratome sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the range of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in areas demarcated by SIS was determined in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiograms of adjacent cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times after MCAO, only SIS showed significantly (P&lt;0.01) lower optical densities in damaged than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue for both white and gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTC staining was as effective as SIS 6 and 48 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tightest correlation between areas of reduced SIS and of reduced CBF was found at a mean ischemic CBF of 22.3 mL/100 g per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a CBF range of 0 to 44 mL/100 g per minute in areas of reduced SIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other staining methods, SIS allows a reliable delineation of ischemic brain tissue (core plus penumbra) from nonischemic white and gray matter of rat brain cryosections as soon as 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
