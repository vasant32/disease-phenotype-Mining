<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In matched groups, local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCMRglc) were measured autoradiographically at either 2-h MCAo or at 1-h recirculation and were correlated on a pixel-by-pixel basis with histopathological infarction after 3-day survival </plain></SENT>
