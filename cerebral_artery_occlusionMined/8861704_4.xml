<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group I, 10 rats were used to determine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>/Mg(+2) ATPase activity and the extent of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation by measuring the malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrastructural findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group II on 20 rats, only subtemporal craniectomy was done in order to determine the effects of the surgical procedure on these indices and findings </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group III with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, saline solution was administered intravenously to 20 rats in the same amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> used in group IV, ten minutes before the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group IV, a single high-dose (30 mg/kg) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> was administered intravenously, ten minutes before occlusion in 20 rats </plain></SENT>
