<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because albumin is the main carrier of free fatty acids (FFA) in plasma, we investigated the content and composition of plasma FFA in jugular vein (JV), femoral artery (FA) and femoral vein (FV) of rats given intravenous human albumin (1.25 g/kg) or saline vehicle (5 mL/kg) 1 h after a 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi> was the only FFA significantly increased by MCAo in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plasma samples prior to albumin administration, remaining at the same level regardless of subsequent treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Albumin treatment induced in both MCAo- and sham-groups a 1.7-fold increase in total plasma FFA (mainly 16:0, 18:1, 18:2n-6) during 90-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAo selectively stimulated the albumin-mediated mobilization of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), with an early increase in 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the FA prior to detectable changes in the JV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the MCAo-albumin group, the lower level of FFA in JV as compared with FA and FV suggests an albumin-mediated systemic mobilization and supply of FFA to the brain, which may favor the replenishment of PUFA lost from cellular membranes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and/or to serve as an alternative source of energy, thus contributing to albumin neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
