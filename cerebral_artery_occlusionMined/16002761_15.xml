<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HG on tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 139 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with documented intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were recorded (in mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The existence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HG was determined by plasma levels of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c, %) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (in micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring assessed complete recanalization 2 hours after tPA bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were obtained at baseline and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, the median NIHSS score was 18 and mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value was 140+/-63 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 2 hours, 32% of patients(n=44) achieved complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who recanalized showed lower admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (127 vs 146 mg/dL; P=0.039) but no differences in HbA1c (6.3% vs 6.3%; P=0.896) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (292 vs 293 micromol/L; P=0.957) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other variables associated with recanalization were initial distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (P=0.011) and platelet count (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with an admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt;158 mg/dL had lower recanalization rates (16% vs 36.1%; P=0.035) and a higher NIHSS score at 48 hours (7 vs 14.5; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology, age, and risk factors, the only independent predictors on admission of no recanalization were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value &gt;158 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR], 7.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 42.3; P=0.027), proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5; P=0.034), and platelet count &lt;219,000/mL (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.1; P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In tPA-treated patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HG state may hamper the fibrinolytic process, delaying reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early measures to reduce HG may favor early recanalization </plain></SENT>
