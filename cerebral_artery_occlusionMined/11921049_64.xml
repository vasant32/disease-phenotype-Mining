<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One unique therapy that may improve functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is blockade of the neurite inhibitory protein Nogo-A with the monoclonal antibody IN-1, through enhancement of neuroanatomical plasticity from uninjured areas of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we combined IN-1 treatment with an ischemic lesion (permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) to determine the effect of Nogo-A neutralization on cortical plasticity and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that, following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and treatment with IN-1, adult rats demonstrated functional recovery on a forelimb-reaching task and new cortico-efferent projections from the opposite, unlesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results support the efficacy of Nogo-A blockade as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and implicate plasticity from the unlesioned hemisphere as a mechanism for recovery </plain></SENT>
