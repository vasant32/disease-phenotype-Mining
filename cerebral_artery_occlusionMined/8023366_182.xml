<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since leukocytes infiltrate into ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, the present study was conducted to examine whether TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> are expressed in the brain after experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and before leukocyte accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were monitored in the ischemic and nonischemic cerebral cortex of rats after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of TNF-alpha administered by microinjection into the brain cortex on leukocyte adherence to brain capillaries was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, normalized to a standard reference rat macrophage TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, was detected as early as 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was elevated by 3 hours (29 +/- 6% versus 2 +/- 1% in sham-operated rats) only in the ischemic cortex, with peak expression at 12 hours (104 +/- 8%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in ischemic cortex were still significantly elevated (38 +/- 5%; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was greater in the ischemic cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling, immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of TNF-alpha protein localized within nerve fibers in the evolving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 6 and 12 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and further expression in the tissues immediately adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 5 days, the neuronally localized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> had diminished greatly, but macrophages located within the infarcted tissues were immunoreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cortical microinjections of TNF-alpha (10 ng in 1 microL) produced a significant neutrophil adherence/accumulation in capillaries and small blood vessels 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first demonstration that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats results in elevated TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neuronal expression of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> appears to facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory cells that can further exacerbate tissue damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and might contribute to increased sensitivity and risk in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
