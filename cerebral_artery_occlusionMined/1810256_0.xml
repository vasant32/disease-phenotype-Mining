<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, immediately after 5 min of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by ligation of the bilateral carotid arteries of Mongolian gerbils, the animals were intraperitoneally injected with 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg CBM36-733 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, perfusion-fixed brains were processed by conventional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of neurons per mm in the CA 1 pyramidal cell layer was calculated and they were labelled neuronal density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the neuronal density was 69.7 +/- 7.2 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>/mm), in the vehicle group and 3 mg/kg of CBM36-733 treated group, they were 12.2 +/- 4.4 and 11.6 +/- 5.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuronal density in the 10 mg/kg of CBM36-733 treated group was 42.2 +/- 8.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that 10 mg/kg of CBM36-733 protects on the CA 1 neurons against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with 3 mg/kg of CBM36-733 every day for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism between the treated group and the vehicle group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
