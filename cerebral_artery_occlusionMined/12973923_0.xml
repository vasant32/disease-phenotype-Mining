<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the anti-apoptotic role of electroacupuncture (EA) and its molecular mechanisms after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (IR) of rats, by using animal model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the changes of the cleavage of PARP were observed by Western blot and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 and Hsp90 beta detected by competitive RT-PCR after cerebral IR and EA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: (1) The cleavage of PARP was increased in ischemic hippocampus, and EA treatment could attenuate the level of the cleavage remarkably; (2) The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Hsp70 was increased in the ischemic cortex and hippocampus and was further increased after EA treatment; (3) The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Hsp90 beta was decreased in ischemic cortex and hippocampus and the decrease was relatively slight after EA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The above results demonstrated EA treatment could protect neurons from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after cerebral IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the molecular mechanisms was the promotion of the inducible expression of Hsp70 and the improvement of the inhibition of the expression of Hsp90 </plain></SENT>
