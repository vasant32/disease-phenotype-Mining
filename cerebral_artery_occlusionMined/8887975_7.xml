<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lead compound SDZ EAB 515 was found to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17295,29997">L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> uptake by the large neutral amino acid carrier in vitro and in vivo; active transport may thus confer a good bioavailability to this class of compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> effects were demonstrated by significant changes in 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi>-uptake in various brain regions at doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the most active agent, SDZ 220-581, full protection against maximal electroshock <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) was obtained at oral doses of 10 mg/kg in rats and in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compound had a fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 1 hr) and a long duration (&gt; or = 24 hr) of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor-debilitating effects (impairment of rotarod performance) occurred at doses about 10 times higher than those required for protection against <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective activity was demonstrated by the ability of the compounds to reduce the extent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi>-induced striatal lesions in rats, in the dose range of 3-15 mg/kg (i.p.) or 10-50 mg/kg (p.o.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, the test compounds reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 40-50% when given i.v. before or by 20-30% when given i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SDZ 220-581 provided 20-30% protection at &gt; or = 2 x 10 mg/kg p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compound also showed <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> activity at low oral doses in a model of neuropathic pain, although higher doses were required in model of mechanical inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0005407'>hyperalgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, SDZ 220-581 at low s.c. doses counteracted the antiparkinsonian effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">L-DOPA</z:chebi> in MPTP-treated marmosets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(Sub)<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of SDZ 220-581 did not reduce its ability to protect against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> neurotoxicity, and no upregulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors was detected using a [3H]CGP-39653 binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, from a series of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi>-AP7-derivatives, SDZ 220-581 is clearly the most active compound in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its pharmacological profile with a good, long-lasting oral activity might open up novel therapeutic applications for competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
