<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used the fluorescent, anionic dye, Fluoro-Jade, to examine cellular degeneration that occurs in association with the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO results in cortical infarction as well as damage to the hippocampus leading to a delayed form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined brain sections at 6 h, 12 h, 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade labeling of the striatum was seen over a protracted time-course, with degeneration beginning by 6 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>Neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in the hippocampus, in contrast, occurs between 12 h and 7 days after injury with neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> reaching a peak at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFAP/Fluoro-Jade double labeling revealed that the Fluoro-Jade positive staining at late time-points in the striatum included astrocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, the results show Fluoro-Jade to be a useful marker of cellular degeneration following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the use of this dye has enabled us to demonstrate previously undescribed events of cellular injury resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
