<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecules that mediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurogenesis are not definitely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using microarrays containing approximately 400 known genes associated with stem cell and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, we compared transcriptional profiles of subventricular zone (SVZ) tissue with cultured neural progenitor cells isolated from the SVZ 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the adult mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SVZ tissue, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> upregulated 58 genes which are involved in multiple signaling pathways during embryonic development, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recaptures embryonic molecular signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In neural progenitor cells cultured in growth medium, 23 gene expressions were increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 8 of 23 genes overlapped with upregulated genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> SVZ tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression alterations of selected genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These in vivo and in vitro data provide new insight into the genetic program of adult SVZ neural progenitor cells after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and demonstrate gene expression differences between SVZ tissue and cultured SVZ cells </plain></SENT>
