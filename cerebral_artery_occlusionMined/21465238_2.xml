<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human embryonic stems transplantation therapy was a novel and potential therapeutic approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, as we have seen, the ethical controversy pertains to embryonic stem cell research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are the latest generation of stem cells that may be a solution to the controversy of using embryonic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, we generated iPSCs from adult human fibroblasts by introduction of four defined transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And then, we investigated the efficacy of iPSCs transplantation therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the animal models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that transplanted iPSCs migrated to injured brain areas, and differentiated into neuron-like cells successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4-16 days iPSCs grafting, sensorimotor function of rats has been improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one word, we may prove that iPSCs therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to be an effective form of treatment </plain></SENT>
