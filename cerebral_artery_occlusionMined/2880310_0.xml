<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etomidate had no effect on CBF before or after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> by comparison with controls, but caused a greater fall in CBF in cats with high preocclusion or initial ischaemic CBF than in those in which CBF was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were more sustained rises in Kp on SG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The established flow threshold for water accumulation was lost; more gyri with CBF above and fewer gyri with CBF below the flow threshold accumulated water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between mean occlusion CBF and in vitro <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> uptake was lost; uptakes from MG were lower and from SG and EG higher than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischaemic penumbra there was a trend towards reduction in CBF, disruption of ion homeostasis and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> formation, whilst in areas of lower flow there was some recovery of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> uptake and less cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> following administration of etomidate </plain></SENT>
