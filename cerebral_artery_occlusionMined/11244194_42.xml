<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the laboratory animal, the ischemic penumbra has been documented as a severely hypoperfused, functionally impaired, but still viable cortex which can regain its function and escape infarction if it is reperfused before a certain time has elapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The penumbra surrounds the ischemic core of already irreversibly damaged tissue, and is progressively recruited into the core with increasing MCAO duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the animal, the threshold of cerebral blood flow (CBF) below which neuronal function is impaired and the tissue is at risk of infarction is around 22 ml/100 g/min (approximately 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in the awake or lightly anesthetized monkey, and around 30--35 ml/100 g/min in the cat and the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The threshold of CBF below which the tissue becomes irreversibly damaged and will progress to infarction depends on the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and is around 10 ml/100 g/min for 1--2 h (approximately 20% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) and around 18 ml/100 g/min for permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mildly reduced CBF down to the 40% threshold (termed 'oligemia') is normally well tolerated, and the affected tissue is not at risk of infarction under uncomplicated conditions (in the animal, however, selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may occur even with only mildly reduced CBF values, but this sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seems an exceptional encounter in man) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classic studies with carotid artery clamping in man have provided estimates for the penumbra threshold at around 20 ml/ 100 g/min for the whole brain, but only recently have imaging studies allowed to document the existence of the penumbra in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and given estimates of local CBF thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With PET, the penumbra is characterized by a reduced CBF, an increased oxygen extraction fraction, and a relatively preserved oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a series of PET studies performed 5--18 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, we have determined the threshold for penumbra to be around 20 ml/100 g/min, and documented that the extent of neurological recovery is proportional to the volume of penumbra that eventually escaped infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within this time interval, the thresholds for irreversible damage were around 8 ml/ 100 g/min for CBF and around 0.9 ml/100 g/min for CMRO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent studies with diffusion-weighted and perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> have reported similar relative thresholds for CBF of about 50 and 18% for penumbra and core, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although it is likely that the threshold for irreversibility will be lower with shorter duration since clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, this has not been documented thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because saving the penumbra will improve clinical outcome, it should constitute the main target of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found evidence of penumbra in about one third of the cases studied between 5 and 18 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and as late as 16 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in occasional patients, suggesting the therapeutic window may be protracted in at least a fraction of the cases; similar experience has recently accrued from diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients, there was evidence of early extensive damage or early spontaneous reperfusion, which would make them inappropriate candidates for neuroprotective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence from PET studies of relative perfusion performed within 3 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> suggests that early thrombolysis indeed saves the tissue with CBF below a critical threshold of 12 ml/ 100 g/min, with a correlation between the volume of such tissue escaping infarction and subsequent neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, mapping the penumbra in the individual patient with physiologic imaging should allow to formulate a pathophysiological diagnosis, and in turn to design a rational management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient and to increase the sensitivity of drug trials by appropriate patient selection </plain></SENT>
