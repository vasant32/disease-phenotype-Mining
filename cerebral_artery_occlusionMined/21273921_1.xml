<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxyl radicals</z:chebi> such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="32849">TEMPO</z:chebi>) have been investigated for their ability to scavenge free radicals produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the short in vivo half-life and toxicity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32849">TEMPO</z:chebi> have limited their clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We developed a core-shell-type nanoparticle, termed a radical-containing nanoparticle (RNP), to deliver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxyl radicals</z:chebi> with prolonged in vivo half-life and pH-sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ability of RNP to deliver <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32849">TEMPO</z:chebi> radicals to the ischemic brain and scavenge free radicals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury using rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: When RNPs were administrated to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rats, the delivery and clearance of RNPs were detected using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> in neuronal cells was observed with dihydroethidium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment effects were evaluated by measuring the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volumes, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and protein oxidation, and neurological symptom scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32849">TEMPO</z:chebi> radicals contained in RNPs were detected for 6 hours after intravenous administration as a triplet EPR signal in the ischemic brain, and RNPs significantly reduced the production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> in neuronal cells compared with saline and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyls (TEMPOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infarction volumes of rats treated by RNPs were significantly lower than those of rats treated by saline, micelles, and TEMPOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, RNP treatment suppressed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and protein oxidation, and limited the adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32849">TEMPO</z:chebi> radicals such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RNPs could be a promising neuroprotective agent with their enhanced ability to scavenge free radicals and reduced toxicity </plain></SENT>
