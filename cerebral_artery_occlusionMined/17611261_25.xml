<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic preconditioning or tolerance is a powerful neuroprotective phenomenon by which a sublethal injurious stimulus renders the brain resistant to a subsequent damaging ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) as a preconditioning stimulus in a mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to examine whether improvements in cerebrovascular function contribute to the protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of LPS 24 h before MCAO reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by 68% and improved ischemic cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 114% in brain areas spared from infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, LPS prevented the dysfunction in cerebrovascular regulation induced by MCAO, as demonstrated by normalization of the increase in CBF produced by neural activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, or by the endothelium-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These beneficial effects of LPS were not observed in mice lacking inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) or the nox2 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-producing enzyme <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPS increased reactive oxygen species and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> marker 3-nitrotyrosine in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice but not in nox2 nulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron (III) attenuated LPS-induced nitration and counteracted the beneficial effects of LPS on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, ischemic CBF, and vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, LPS preserves neurovascular function and ameliorates CBF in regions of the ischemic territory at risk for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formed from iNOS-derived NO and nox2-derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that preservation of cerebrovascular function is an essential component of ischemic tolerance and suggest that combining neuroprotection and vasoprotection may be a valuable strategy for treating ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
