<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have been focused on neuroprotection, with only a little attention on cerebrovascular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effect of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, induced by 15 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and cerebrovascular injury induced by a permanent MCAO induced three days later </plain></SENT>
