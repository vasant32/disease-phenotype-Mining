<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of putative neuroprotective compounds to protect against white matter injury remains poorly investigated due to the lack of suitable methods for assessing white matter injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was therefore designed to investigate the utility of Tau 1 (oligodendrocytes/axons), myelin basic protein (MBP; myelin) and amyloid precursor protein (APP; axons) immunohistochemistry in assessing white matter injury at various times following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was induced in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anaesthetised rats using an intraluminal thread model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks following MCAO, white matter injury was assessed using Tau 1, APP, MBP and Luxol-fast blue staining and neuronal injury with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52163">cresyl fast violet</z:chebi> (CFV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue MBP immunoreactivity was detected in myelinated fibre tracts, while Tau 1 and APP were axonally located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h following permanent MCAO, MBP, and Tau 1 staining remained relatively unchanged within the myelin and axonal compartments of the ischaemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increased Tau 1 staining was apparent in oligodendrocytes within ischaemic tissue, while APP accumulated in axons surrounding the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 2 weeks following transient MCAO, Tau 1 and APP staining was markedly decreased within ischaemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marked reduction in MBP levels within ischaemic tissue were not detected until 2 weeks following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area of axonal injury as assessed by reduced Tau 1 or APP staining correlated with the area of neuronal damage as assessed by CFV staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows that MBP, Tau 1 and APP immunohistochemistry can be utilised to assess myelin and axonal integrity following sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> using standard image analysis techniques </plain></SENT>
