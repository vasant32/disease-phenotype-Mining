<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) plays an important role in water transport in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and is highly expressed in brain astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the AQP4 regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are involved in changes in osmolality, might mediate AQP4 expression in models of rat cortical astrocytes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of AQP4 in primary cultured astrocytes subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and 2 h of reoxygenation were observed, after which they immediately decreased at 0â€‰h of reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes exposed to OGD injury had significantly increased phosphorylation of three kinds of MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SB203580, a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, or SP600125, a selective c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the return of AQP4 to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, and SB203580, but not SP600125, significantly decreased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an in vivo study, AQP4 expression was upregulated 1-3 days after reperfusion, which was consistent with the time course of p38 phosphorylation and activation, and decreased by the p38 inhibition after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that p38 MAPK may regulate AQP4 expression in cortical astrocytes after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
