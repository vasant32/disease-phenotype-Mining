<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, 4-HNE has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of 4-HNE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is unclear yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that plasma 4-HNE concentrations were higher in the genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats) and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, administration of 4-HNE via intravenous injection before MCAO surgery not only enlarged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, but also increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in brain tissue, which was evidenced by the enhanced ROS/MPA levels, and the reduced GSH/GSSG ratio and MnSOD levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenasesbcl-2 (ALDH2), an enzyme catalyses 4-HNE, rescued neuronal survival against 4-HNE treatment in PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma 4-HNE concentrations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were higher than those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a small sample population (N=60), the plasma 4-HNE concentration was positively correlated with the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration, a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our study suggests that the plasma 4-HNE level is a potential biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
