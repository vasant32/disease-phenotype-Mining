<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether these dyes have neurotrophin-like activities and neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By screening more than 250 cyanine dyes, we found that NK-4 and NK-150, which belong to a group of pentamethine trinuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37960">cyanine dyes</z:chebi>, significantly potentiated nerve growth factor (NGF)-primed neurite outgrowth of PC12HS cells in nanomolar to micromolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both NK-4 and NK-150 showed a remarkable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi>-scavenging activity using an in vitro electron spin resonance (ESR)-based technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also effectively scavenged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29369">peroxy</z:chebi> radicals, and in addition, NK-4 acted on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxides</z:chebi> to a similar extent as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, NK-4 and NK-150 prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24 h reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dyes were intravenously administrated twice 1 h after the occlusion and immediately after the start of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK-4 and NK-150 (100 Âµg/kg) reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by 57.0% and 46.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those dyes also decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in the ischemic semispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, administration of NK-4 and NK-150 provided substantial improvements in MCAO-induced neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NK-4 and NK-150 effectively prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury through their potent neurotrophin-like activity as well as antioxidative activity </plain></SENT>
