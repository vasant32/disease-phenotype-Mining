<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with pattern of local cerebral blood flow (CBF) in sham-operated rats and with neuropathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In every animal there was a profound reduction (to 13% of control levels)in blood flow in the neocortex previously by the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of blood flow in the areas in which ischaemic brain damage occurred was 0.24 +/- 0.03 ml g-1 min-1 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>). this level of CBF is considerably greater than that reported following a similar surgical procedure in cats and primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate reductions in blood flow were also seen outside the territory of the occluded artery and in parts of the opposite hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absolute increases in blood flow (hyperaemia) were seen only in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus ipsilateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is of the middle cerebral artery are reflections of alterations in neuronal function and metabolic activity secondary to the ischaemic lesion </plain></SENT>
