<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> were spontaneously induced by either unilateral frontal penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) or permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) and detected by continuous EEG monitoring begun immediately after the injury and continued for 72 h or 24 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> profiles (incidence, frequency, duration, and time distribution) revealed a high <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> incidence in both injury models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EEG waveform expressions of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> and PED exhibited intrinsic variations which resembled human electrographic manifestations of post-traumatic and post-ischemic ictal and inter-ictal events, but these waveform variations were not distinguishable between two types of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> after pMCAO occurred more acutely and intensely (latency=0.6 h, frequency = 25 episodes/rat) compared to the PBBI-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi>(latency=26 h, frequency = 10 episodes/rat), such that the most salient features differentiating post-traumatic and post-ischemic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> were the intensity and time distribution of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After pMCAO, nearly 50% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred within the first 2 h of injury, whereas after PBBI, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> occurred sporadically (0-5% per hour) throughout the 72 h recording period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PED were episodically associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the IRDA appeared to be independent of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> events </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of the similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> events may lead to differential strategies for post-traumatic and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> interventions </plain></SENT>
