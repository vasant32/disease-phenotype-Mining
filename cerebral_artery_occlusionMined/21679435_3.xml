<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After promising results in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, normobaric (NBO) or hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) have recently been discussed as co-medication with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for improving outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the interactions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> and tPA, focusing on survival, early functional outcome and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats (n = 109) underwent embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were assigned to: Control, NBO (60-minute pure oxygen), HBO (60-minute pure oxygen at 2.4 absolute atmospheres), tPA, or HBO+tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional impairment was assessed at 4 and 24 hours using Menzies score, followed by intravenous application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability marker, which was allowed to circulate for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, blood sampling was performed at 5 and 25 hours for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality rates did not differ significantly between groups, whereas functional improvement was found for NBO, tPA and HBO+tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NBO and HBO tended to stabilize <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and to reduce MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>tPA tended to increase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability with corresponding MMP and TIMP elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-administered HBO failed to attenuate these early deleterious effects, independent of functional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term consequences of simultaneously applied tPA and both NBO and HBO need to be addressed by further studies to identify therapeutic potencies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to avoid unfavorable courses following combined treatment </plain></SENT>
