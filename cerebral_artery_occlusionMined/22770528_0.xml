<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: We reviewed the early development of various focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and summarized recent reports on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 6 focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models established in divergent substrains of SHR, distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is the most frequently used and relevant method of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the light of penumbra concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed an online PubMed search (2001-2010), and identified 118 original articles with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters such as age, body weight, and even blood pressure were often neglected in the literature: the information regarding the physiological parameters of SHR is critical, and should be provided within the methodology section of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> articles related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the quality of recent studies on neuroprotective strategy is improving, the mechanisms underlying the protection should be more clearly recognized so as to facilitate the translation from animal studies to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To overcome the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in substrains of SHR, new approaches, such as a huge repository of genetic markers in rat strains and the congenic strategy, are currently in progress </plain></SENT>
