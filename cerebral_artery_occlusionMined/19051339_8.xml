<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(LC) have been used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> (FA), a component in both AS and LC, plays a role in neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the involvement of neuroprotective pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion after 90 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and neurological deficits were measured after 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) immunoreactive cells were assessed after 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of 80 and 100 mg/kg of FA at the beginning of MCAo significantly reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and neurological deficit-score, similar results were obtained by 100 mg/kg of FA administered 30 min after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FA treatment (100 mg/kg i.v.) effectively suppressed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals in the parenchyma lesion, and ICAM-1 immunoreactive vessels in the ischemic striatum after 2 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FA (100 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB in the ischemic cortex and striatum, also down-regulated MPO immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortex after 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the effect of FA on reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and neurological deficit-score were at least partially attributed to the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals, ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression in transient MCAo rats </plain></SENT>
