<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether S-100beta production by reactive astrocytes accumulating within the periinfarct area was related to delayed expansion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After rapid increases during the initial 24 hours, the increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume then decelerated while maintaining the increasing tendency until 168 hours in this model, attaining a significant difference compared with that at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the periinfarct area, the number of reactive astrocytes expressing both S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, the tissue level of S-100beta as measured by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosolvent assay method using anti-S-100beta monoclonal antibody, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2;-deoxyuridine 5;-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling-positive cells were significantly increased preceding the delayed expansion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF concentration of S-100beta showed a biphasic increase, presumably reflecting the immediate release from astrocytes within the ischemic core and the subsequent production in reactive astrocytes within the periinfarct area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show for the first time that the enhanced synthesis of S-100beta by reactive astrocytes participates in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> within the periinfarct area, which may be related to the occurrence of delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion as a major component of the cytokine network </plain></SENT>
