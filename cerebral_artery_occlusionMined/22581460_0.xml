<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathophysiology differs between young adult and aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion in young adult and aged female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was performed by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with fibrin clot followed by reperfusion with i.v. human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological and functional outcomes were measured at 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with fibrin clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aged rats treated with 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> had significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared with placebo-treated aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Young adult rats treated with 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> had significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved functional outcome compared with ovariectomized young adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> may act in an age-dependent manner in the postischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In young adult rats, it is neuroprotective; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> during aging leads to worsened ischemic brain injury in aged female rats </plain></SENT>
