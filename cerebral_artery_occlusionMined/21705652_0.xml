<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fundamental issues such as whether ER is effective in other models, optimal rehabilitation intensity, and underlying recovery mechanisms have not been fully assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors tested whether the efficacy of ER varies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model and assessed the importance of rehabilitation intensity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats in experiment 1 received 8 weeks of ER or remained in standard housing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed with the staircase and cylinder tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, ER provided no functional benefit in any model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, ER was delivered during the light phase, whereas other studies delivered ER in the dark phase of the light cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that in the light, rats engaged in less rehabilitation or alternatively that BDNF was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 tested these hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following MCAo, rats received ER in either the light or dark phase of the light cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed and BDNF levels were measured in the motor cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recovery was accompanied by increased BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This occurred only in rats that received ER in the dark and these animals reached more than those in the light condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that there is a critical threshold of rehabilitation, below which recovery will not occur, and that BDNF mediates functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of intensive rehabilitation therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is strongly supported </plain></SENT>
