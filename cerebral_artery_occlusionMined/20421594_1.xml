<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 belongs to a family of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding proteins that plays a central role in pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that hnRNP A2/B1 may be involved in the progress of I/R; therefore, the present study aimed to examine expression patterns of hnRNP A2/B1 to better understand posttranscriptional regulations in cerebral I/R insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral I/R models were induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 120 min followed by 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr of reperfusion in male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We employed immunohistochemistry to examine expression of hnRNP A2/B1 in rat cerebral cortex (including cingulate cortex, striate cortex, temporal cortex, and piriform cortex) and hippocampus after I/R insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that expression of hnRNP A2/B1 was significantly downregulated in cerebral cortex and hippocampus from 3 to 24 hr of reperfusion after MCAO for 120 min, but significantly upregulated at 48 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, translocation of hnRNP A2/B1 from nucleus to cytoplasm and even to neurites was observed in cerebral cortex at 3 hr of reperfusion, reaching a peak at 24 hr of reperfusion, but not in hippocampus, indicating different posttranscriptional regulation patterns in different brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, translocation of hnRNP A2/B1 was only observed in cerebral cortex with MCAO but not in the opposite side, suggesting an I/R-specific expression pattern in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that hnRNP A2/B1 participates in posttranscriptional regulation of neurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus that suffered I/R insults, although posttranscriptional regulation is more extensive in neuronal cells of cerebral cortex than in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
