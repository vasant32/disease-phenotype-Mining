<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours followed by up to 72 hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n=6/group): puerarin at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg or saline, administered intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 2% triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were determined 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining was used to detect the cell damage of brains (n=5/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin activation was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n=5/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle saline group, puerarin decreased infarction volume at doses of 200 mg/kg (p=0.045) and 400 mg/kg (p=0.0002), but not at 100 mg/kg (p=0.387) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional neurological outcome was improved with puerarin at 400 mg/kg (p=0.015), but not at 100 mg/kg (p=0.68) or 200 mg/kg (p=0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Puerarin significantly decreased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining cells compared with the vehicle group 4, 24 and 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The erythropoietin activity was higher in puerarin treated group compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Puerarin has neuroprotection effects in rats at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> which may be partly due to activation of erythropoietin activity </plain></SENT>
