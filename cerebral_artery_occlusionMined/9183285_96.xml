<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of pretreatment of TNF administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, or intracisternally in mice that were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) 48 h later </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was noted in mice pretreated by TNF at the dose of 0.5 microgram/mouse (p &lt; 0.01) intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the doses used in this study, administration of TNF by intravenous or intraperitoneal routes was not effective </plain></SENT>
