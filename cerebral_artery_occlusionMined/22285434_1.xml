<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotic drug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi>, a multifunctional D2-like <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and sigma receptor subtype <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, has neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we further examined the association between neuroprotection and receptor antagonism by evaluating a panel of novel compounds with varying affinity at sigma and D2-like <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds were evaluated using an in vitro cytotoxicity assay that utilizes a hippocampal-derived cell line, HT-22, in the presence or absence of varying concentrations (5 to 20 mM) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> was found to be a potent neuroprotective agent in this in vitro cell assay, the prototypic sigma 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (+)-pentazocine was found not to be neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the potency for the neuroprotection of HT-22 cells was evaluated for a) three SV series <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24828">indoles</z:chebi> which have nMolar affinity at D2-like receptors but varying affinity at sigma 1 receptor and b) two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16562">phenylacetamides</z:chebi> sigma 1 receptor selective compounds which bind with low affinity at D2-like receptors but have nMolar affinity for the sigma 1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that cytoprotection correlated with the affinity of the compounds for sigma 1 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based upon results from the HT-22 cell-based in vitro assay, two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16562">phenylacetamides</z:chebi>, LS-127 and LS-137, were further evaluated in vivo using a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a dose of 100 Î¼g/kg, both LS-127 and LS-137 attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies provide further evidence that sigma 1 receptor selective compounds can provide neuroprotection in cytotoxic situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results also demonstrate that sigma 1 receptor selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16562">phenylacetamides</z:chebi> are candidate pharmacotherapeutic agents that could be used to minimize neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or head trauma </plain></SENT>
