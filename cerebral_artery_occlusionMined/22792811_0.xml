<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find the potential biomarkers, and to explore metabolic mechanisms of Tongsaimai pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rat models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was established with electric coagulation, and rats were divided into 4 groups, model group, sham-operation group, Tongsaimai pellets group and positive control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tongsaimai pellets and positive control group were orally administrated by 13.2 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) of crude drugs and 32 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) of Nimodipine respectively, m odel and sham-operation group by equal volume of distilled water for a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma of model and sham-operation group were collected, and plasma of Tongsaimai pellets and positive control group were collected on the 1st, 3rd , 7th day after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous metabolites of four groups were determined with GC-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial least squares discriminant analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) was applied to analyze multivariate data and set up model, and T-test was used in significant statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Compared with sham-operation group rats, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32816">pyruvic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> obviously increased in model group rats, while <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33508">glyceric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17475">aminomalonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, tryptophan and leucine significantly decreased, so these metabolites were potential metabolic biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These endogenous metabolites except <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> got restoration in Tongsaimai group rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal metabolite level in plasma can be certainly recovered by Tongsaimai pellets, and the treatment of Tongsaimai pellets can be connected with the regulation of related metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
