<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we observed whether RQKL could exert influence on the expression of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), as a mechanism of its protective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established by permanent filament occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the administration of RQKL could reduce the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as neurological deficit of model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was showed that the eNOS level was consistently increased in endothelium of blood vessels of the ischemic penumbra after 2 to 72 h of permanent MCAO, and the expression of eNOS increases more in animals treated with RQKL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that eNOS levels in penumbral zone were enhanced after permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and RQKL could stimulate postischemic eNOS expression, which may be an important mechanism in RQKL's protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
