<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that fasudil mesylate (FM) improves neurological deficit and neuronal damage in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the properties of FM on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> insult in cultured PC12 cells as well as the underlying mechanisms were investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with FM (5, 10 Î¼M) prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> exposure significantly elevated cell viability, reduced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, LDH assay, Hoechst 33258 dye staining, and FM also decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DCFH-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> staining and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FM also reversed the upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the downstream cascade following ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FM protected PC12 cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> insult via downregulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a direct effect of fasudil mesylate on PC12 cells may be partly responsible for its protective effect against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> injury </plain></SENT>
