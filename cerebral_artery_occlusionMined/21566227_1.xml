<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a cerebrovascular defect that leads to many adverse neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current pharmacological treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remain unclear in their effectiveness, whereas stem cell transplantation shows considerable promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) can differentiate into neurons in neuronal-conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluate the therapeutic potential of HUMSC transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HUMSCs treated with neuronal-conditioned medium or not treated were transplanted into the ischemic cortex 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histology and MRI revealed that rats implanted with HUMSCs treated with neuronal-conditioned medium or not treated exhibited a trend toward less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and significantly less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> compared with the control group, which received no HUMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rats receiving HUMSCs showed significant improvements in motor function, greater metabolic activity of cortical neurons, and better revascularization in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implanted HUMSCs, treated or not treated, survived in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex for at least 36 days and released neuroprotective and growth-associated cytokines, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, platelet-derived growth factor-AA, basic fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin-2, CXCL-16, neutrophil-activating protein-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of HUMSC transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, likely due to the ability of the cells to produce growth-promoting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, HUMSC transplantation may be an effective therapy in the future </plain></SENT>
