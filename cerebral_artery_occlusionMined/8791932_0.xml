<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> can be separated from permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> via calcium 45 autoradiography and to assess the applicability of dual isotope single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) in the evaluation of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined calcium influx in 12 dogs (group A) by using whole-brain calcium 45 autoradiography: Animals received 250 microCi/kg 24 hours after 30-minute (n = 6) or permanent (n = 6) middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 5-mm coronal brain sections were fixed for either autoradiography or pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a separate study, 9 mongrel dogs (group B) were given 250 microCi/kg calcium 45 and a mean dose of 700 microCi/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> Tc 99m hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> plug was then injected into the internal carotid artery and angiography was performed to verify <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 10th (control) animal did not undergo occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an 11th animal, placement of the plug could not be achieved and a slurry of microfibrillar collagen was injected into the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No angiography was performed in animals 10 and 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After occlusion, each animal was injected with a mean dose of 126 microCi/kg simultaneous acquisition for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> 99m and 123I-iodoamphetamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals who had permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion showed infarction and increased calcium 45 uptake in infarcted territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the animals who had 30-minute occlusion had either increased calcium 45 uptake or infarction at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group B, 7 or 10 dogs had SPECT findings that were consistent with the calcium autoradiographic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One animal died during the procedure and 1 dog served as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Calcium 45 autoradiography allowed distinction between areas of temporary and permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Iodoamphetamine imaging was not consistently sensitive to that level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Timing of calcium influx may lead to insight that could impact timing of pharmacologic or endovascular intervention </plain></SENT>
