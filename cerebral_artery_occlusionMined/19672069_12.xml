<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (EPO) promotes cytoprotection and neurogenesis in the short term following brain injury; however, long-term cognitive outcomes and optimal dosing regimens have not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in postnatal day 10 rats, which were treated with either a single dose of EPO (5 U/g, i.p.) immediately upon reperfusion, or 3 doses of EPO (1 U/g, i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>each) at 0 h, 24 h, and 7 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 months after injury, rats treated with 3 doses of EPO did not differ from shams in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, and generally performed better than either rats treated with a single dose or vehicle-treated injured rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These multiple-dose-treated rats also had increases in hemispheric volume and its subregions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that additional, later doses of EPO may be required for cell repair, proliferation, and long-term incorporation into neural networks after neonatal brain injury </plain></SENT>
