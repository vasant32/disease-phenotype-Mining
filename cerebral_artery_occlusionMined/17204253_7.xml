<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the usefulness of serum S100B as a biomarker, the present study proceeded by observing serum S100B kinetics in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model, then assessed the correlation between serum S100B and both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study results showed increases in serum S100B concentrations, peaking 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere significantly increased from 24 h after MCAO, and reached peak value 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single measurement of serum S100B 48 h after MCAO showed significant correlations with maximal extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, S100B concentrations 48 h after MCAO significantly correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcomes were estimated in a long-term study, where a gradual recovery was observed up to 168 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum S100B 48 h after MCAO was found to show higher correlation with neurological score 168 h after MCAO than those 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that serum S100B is an effective biomarker in predicting both extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and long-term neurological outcomes in a rat transient MCAO model </plain></SENT>
