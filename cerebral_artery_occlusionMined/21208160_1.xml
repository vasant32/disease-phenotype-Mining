<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its significance, present treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> simply provides symptomatic relief due to the fact that molecular mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and aquaporins (AQP-4 and -9) in regulating cerebral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> accumulation and inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-AQP-4 antibody, anti-AQP-9 antibody, or 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, an inhibitor of HIF-1α) was given at the time of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed at 1 and 24 hours after reperfusion and their brains were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extracellular and intracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentration of brain tissue was calculated with an enzymatic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein expressions of HIF-1α, AQP-4 and AQP-9 were determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was measured by brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01), increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05), and enhanced expressions of HIF-1α, AQP-4, and AQP-9 (p &lt; 0.05) were observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With inhibition of AQP-4, AQP-9 or HIF-1α, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased while intracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> was increased (p &lt; 0.01) 1 hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of HIF-1α with 2ME2 suppressed (p &lt; 0.01) the expression of AQP-4 and AQP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that HIF-1α serves as an upstream regulator of cerebral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> via a molecular pathway involving AQP-4 and AQP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological blockade of this pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may provide novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
