<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined 28 patients with a moderately ischemic area (ratio of affected regional activity to cerebellar activity (A/C ratio) of 0.4 to 0.7) determined using pretreatment SPECT, and with complete recanalization within 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment dynamic and static SPECT studies were performed immediately after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of the affected area outlined on pretreatment SPECT was used for the posttreatment SPECT images, and A/C ratios were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative retention ratio of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> in the affected area was also analyzed using posttreatment dynamic SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients either without infarction or with small subcortical and basal ganglial infarction, 11 patients with medium or large cortical infarction, and 3 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were identified by follow-up computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic outcome correlated with the relative retention ratio of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> more closely than either the pre- or posttreatment A/C ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, a threshold value for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was distinct only in the relative retention ratio of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT did not always predict the occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation, whereas dynamic 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT performed immediately after thrombolysis allowed clear identification of patients at risk for hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
