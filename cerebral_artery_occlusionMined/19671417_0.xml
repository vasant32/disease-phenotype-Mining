<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of scalp acupuncture in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty SD rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were randomly divided into untreated group and scalp acupuncture group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scalp acupuncture was performed by inserting needles from Baihui (GV20) to Qubin (GB7), and the scalp was stabbed through 0.5 to 0.8 cun with a 30 degree angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a Han's Electro-Acupuncture Apparatus was connected, we selected "disperse-dense" wave and alternated frequency of 2 Hz and 100 Hz at an intensity level of 2 mA, 30 min once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 10 SD rats without <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were taken as sham-operated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological severity score (NSS), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to observing the changes of neurofunctional defect, the inflammatory infiltration in cerebral tissue and the contents of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in brain tissues after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences in NSS between the scalp acupuncture group and the untreated group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion, especially after 72-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HE staining results of ischemic cerebral tissues showed an apparent reduction of inflamed lesions in the scalp acupuncture group as compared with the untreated group, especially after 72-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contents of COX-2 and NF-kappaB after reperfusion in the scalp acupuncture group were significantly lower than those in the untreated group in 24, 48 and 72 h (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05), and the contents of TGF-beta1 in scalp acupuncture group were significantly higher than those in the untreated group after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury, improve neurofunctional rehabilitation and suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in rats by decreasing the contents of COX-2 and NF-kappaB and enhancing TGF-beta1 expression in brain tissues </plain></SENT>
