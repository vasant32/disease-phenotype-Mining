<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To research the effects of moschus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28093">borneol</z:chebi>, styrax and benzoinum on the structure and function of blood brain barrier in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Focal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was introduced as an in vivo ischemic model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 h MCAO, nylon suture was pulled up 1 cm to give blood reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 22 h reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were decapitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultramicrostructure of blood brain barrier of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> hemisphere side in fronto-parietal cortex region by transmission electron microscope, and the content of VEGF and MMP-9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> side brain tissue were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In model and solvent group rats, the capillary endothelium cells, astro-glial cells and nerve cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> hemisphere side in fronto-parietal region were emerged in different degree compared with sham-operated groups, which exhibited tight junction between endothelial cells being opened, basal lamina being dissolved, and permeability increasing, and cellularedema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28093">borneol</z:chebi> (0.2 g x kg(-1)) group rats, the structure of three kinds of cells were nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, which tight junction structure was clear, rough endoplasmic reticulum and polyribosome could be found in cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In moschus (66.6 mg x kg(-1)) group rats, the structure of capillary endothelium cells and astrocytes were nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as well as the basal lamina, but the electrons in neurons was maldistribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In styrax (1.332 g x kg(-1)) group rats, astrocytes were nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while capillary endothelial cells and neurons exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in different degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the basal lamina was discontinuous, augmentation of cell spaces in endothelial cells increased the permeability, some endoplasmic reticulum broadened and ribosome ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In benzoinum (1.0 g x kg(-1)) group rats, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes was significant, basal lamina broke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile endoplasmic reticulum broadened as vacuole, the number of ribosome in rough endoplasmic reticulum decreased, crista mitochondriales in some neurons disappeared as vacuole which hint <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> happened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results also showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28093">borneol</z:chebi> decrease the level of VEGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> side brain tissue significantly, while has little influence on the level of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moschus showed the tendency to decrease the level of VEGF and MMP-9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> side brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aromatic resuscitation drugs showed the protection effect on blood brain barrier in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury rats, which the protection effect of moschus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28093">borneol</z:chebi> were better than that of styrax and benzoinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of protection effect maybe related to decrease the level of VEGF and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
