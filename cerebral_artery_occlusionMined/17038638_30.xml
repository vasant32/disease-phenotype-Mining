<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested whether voluntary running would enhance neovascularization and long-term recovery following mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> mice were exposed to 30 minutes of middle-cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous voluntary running on wheels conferred long-term upregulation of eNOS in the vasculature and of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the spleen and bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with higher numbers of circulating EPCs in the blood and enhanced neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, engraftment of TIE2/LacZ-positive BM-derived cells was increased in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after the insult, trained animals showed higher numbers of newly generated cells in vascular sites, increased density of perfused microvessels and sustained augmentation of cerebral blood flow within the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, running conferred tissue sparing and improved functional outcome at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of running on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and outcome were completely abolished when animals were treated with a NOS inhibitor or the antiangiogenic compound endostatin after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and in animals lacking eNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Voluntary physical activity improves long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome by eNOS-dependent mechanisms related to improved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
