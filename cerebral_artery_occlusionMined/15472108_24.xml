<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the brain, there are 3 different genes coding for 3 different proteins: NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 might play a differential role in the development of cerebral injury induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By means of Western blotting, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 protein expression was evaluated in the ischemic core and in the remaining nonischemic area of the slice at different time intervals starting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of each isoform was also assessed with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeted for each isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ODNs were continuously intracerebroventricularly infused with an osmotic minipump (1 microL/h) for 48 hours, 24 hours before pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that after pMCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 NCX proteins were downregulated in ischemic core; NCX3 decreased in periinfarctual area whereas NCX1 and NCX2 were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ODNs for NCX1 and NCX3 gene products were capable of inducing an increase in the ischemic lesion and to worsen neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that in the neuroprotective effect exerted by NCX during ischemic injury, the major role is prevalently exerted by NCX1 and NCX3 gene products </plain></SENT>
