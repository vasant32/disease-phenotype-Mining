<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used a rat model of thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator after different periods of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and we analyzed the effect of the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on the rate of hemorrhagic transformation, the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and the degree of neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the rats reperfused before 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, while 90% of the rats occluded for more than 3 h developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> ranging from benign hemorrhagic infarctions to severe parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6-hour occlusion, the proportion of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, as seen in 50% of the animals, was significantly augmented compared to the 11 to 13% of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> observed in animals occluded for less than 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> measured in the brain parenchyma of animals showing hemorrhagic infarctions was doubled (0.19 mg/hemisphere in rats reperfused after 6 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared to 0.08 mg/hemisphere in rats reperfused earlier) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome did also worsen with the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the amplitude of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was not statistically different in animals subjected to short or longer time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation and the degree of neurological impairment were not statistically different between animals occluded for less than 3 h and animals permanently occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data clearly demonstrate a progression in the risk and gravity of hemorrhagic transformation that parallels the increase in the duration of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a relationship, which is independent on the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, between neurological deficit and hemorrhagic transformation and confirm the expected but still debated principle that early recanalization of an occluded artery reduces the hemorrhagic risk after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
