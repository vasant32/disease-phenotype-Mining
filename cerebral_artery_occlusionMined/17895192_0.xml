<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The monofilament technique of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was used in 3 separate studies to evaluate the efficacy of the low-affinity, use-dependent N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, AR-R15896AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, a dose-response curve was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wister Kyoto rats received 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five minutes later, a 30-minute intravenous infusion of AR-R15896AR was given, followed by subcutaneous implantation of Alzet minipumps that were calibrated to maintain specified plasma levels (approximately 682, 1885, or 2682 ng/mL) of AR-R15896 (free base) for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest plasma level attained significantly decreased the percentage of damage to the subcortex, cortex, and total brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the high-dose, 1-week treatment regimen was repeated to determine if neuroprotection would extend to 8 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in separate groups of animals, significant reduction in the percentage of damage, which was generally confined to the cortex and subcortex, was observed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Third, verification was achieved in another laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lister Hooded rats received 60 minutes of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 70 minutes, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dose of AR-R15896AR (20.3 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and the rats were killed 23 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This treatment group also exhibited significant reduction in the volume of infarction in the subcortex, cortex, and total brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these investigations supports the ongoing Phase II clinical trials in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
