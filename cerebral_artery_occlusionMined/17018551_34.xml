<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> represents one of the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability in Western countries, but despite intense research, only few options exist for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related infarction of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cell therapy can partly reverse some behavioural deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms have remained unknown as most studies revealed only little, if any, evidence for neuronal replacement and the observed behavioural improvements appeared to be related rather to a graft-derived induction of a positive response in the remaining host tissue than to cell replacement by the graft itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to test a murine embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based approach in rats subjected to endothelin-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of cell therapy regarding graft survival, neuronal yield and diversity, and electrophysiological features of the grafted cells were tested after transplanting ESC-derived neural precursors into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and periphery of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that grafted cells can survive, albeit not entirely, most probably as a consequence of an ongoing immune response, within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core for up to 12 weeks after transplantation and that they differentiate with high yield into immunohistochemically mature glial cells and neurons of diverse neurotransmitter-subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, transplanted cells demonstrate characteristics of electrophysiologically functional neurons with voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> currents that enable these cells to fire action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, during the first 7 weeks after transplantation we observed spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents in graft-derived cells indicating synaptic input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our observations show that ESC-based regenerative approaches may be successful in an acutely necrotic cellular environment </plain></SENT>
