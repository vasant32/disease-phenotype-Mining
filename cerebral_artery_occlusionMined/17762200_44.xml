<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to promote cytoprotection and neurogenesis and decrease subventricular zone morphologic changes following brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The long-term cellular response to EPO has not been defined, and local changes in cell fate decision may play a role in functional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in P10 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPO treatment (5 U/g i.p.) significantly preserved hemispheric brain volume 6 weeks after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EPO increased the percentage of newly generated neurons while decreasing newly generated astrocytes following brain injury, without demonstrating long-term differences in the subventricular zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EPO may neuroprotect and direct cell fate toward neurogenesis and away from gliogenesis in neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
