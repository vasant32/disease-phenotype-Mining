<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial vessel occlusion, angiographic demonstration of antegrade contrast opacification distal to the occlusion site (termed the "clot outline sign") has been associated with higher rates of vessel recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether antegrade flow can be demonstrated on time-resolved 4-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (4-dimensional CTA), whether it can be distinguished from retrograde collateral flow, and if it can be used to predict early recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial anterior circulation vessel occlusion were retrospectively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had received a multimodal computed tomography examination including thin-section 4-dimensional CTA and subsequent digital subtraction angiography as part of an endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment 4-dimensional CTA and single-phase CTA were assessed for presence of antegrade contrast opacification distal to the occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiograms were reviewed for preintervention Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> grade, presence of the clot outline sign, as well as postintervention Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On 4-dimensional CTA, evidence of antegrade flow was present in 11 of 57 cases (19.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with angiography, 4-dimensional CTA predicted antegrade flow with 100% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single-phase CTA offered 40% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization occurred in 3 patients (6.5%) after intravenous thrombolysis (n=46); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated antegrade flow on 4-dimensional CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using 4-dimensional CTA, it is possible to noninvasively distinguish antegrade flow across a cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from retrograde collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presence of antegrade flow on 4-dimensional CTA is associated with an increased chance of early vessel recanalization </plain></SENT>
