<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the impact of residual cortical cerebral blood flow on the neuroprotective efficacy of human albumin in a rat transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to different magnitudes of residual cortical cerebral blood flow during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, rats were divided into three groups: Group I, cerebral blood flow &lt;25% of the baseline; Group II, cerebral blood flow between 25 and 50% of the baseline; Group III, cerebral blood flow &gt;50% of the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were observed after 48 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores and motor function were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 days of reperfusion, human albumin therapy significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved the neurological and motor function compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group only in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group I and in Group III, whether human albumin was administered or not, rats in Group I always showed a poor outcome and rats in Group III always showed an excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that human albumin has neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment only within a magnitude range of residual cortical cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
