<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A clinical chart review was retrospectively conducted for 30 patients who had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and were treated with open embolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, the patients' outcome at discharge is divided in two groups: favorable outcome (good recovery and moderate disability) or unfavorable outcome (severe disability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following variables between the favorable and unfavorable outcomes were analysed: age, sex, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score on admission, affected side, occlusion site, occlusion time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> on electrocardiogram, fibrinolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic infarction after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The outcomes of 30 patients were favorable in 16 patients (good recovery in nine and moderate disability in seven) and unfavorable in 14 patients (severe disability in 12, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> in one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The M1 occlusion and fibrinolysis performance were more frequent in the unfavorable outcome group than in the favorable one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis with a stepwise method indicated that the only occlusion site was independently associated with the unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occlusion time &gt;360 minutes was not the predictor of the unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The outcome of patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion treated by the open embolectomy depends on the occlusion site and the fibrinolysis performance in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The M1 occlusion is also the independent risk factor of the unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the occlusion time itself has no relation to the unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that therapeutic time windows vary in individuals probably due to the collateral blood flow </plain></SENT>
