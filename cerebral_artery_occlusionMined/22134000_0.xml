<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study investigated the correlation between infarction areas and behavioural deficits in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and photothrombosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the MCAO model, a 0.38 mm-diameter <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated thread was introduced through the left external carotid artery and advanced 18 mm via the internal carotid artery to the origin of middle cerebral artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thread was removed for reperfusion after occlusion for 0.5, 1 or 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the photothrombosis model, after a midline incision on the scalp, a focused light (10,000 lux, 6 mm-diameter) was delivered 1mm anterior to the bregma and 3mm left of the midline for 5, 10 or 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 2 min of irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye (30 mg/kg) was injected intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours post-surgery, the animals were subjected to neurological scoring and behavioural performances, and were sacrificed for macroscopic and microscopic examinations of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total infarction volumes in the MCAO model rats increased in an occlusion time-dependent manner, while the infarction volumes in photothrombosis model rats plateaued relatively quickly with no time-dependent increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MCAO model displayed neurological scores and behavioural deficits that correlated well with infarction volumes, while relatively poor correlation between infarction volume and neurobehavioural abnormalities was evident in the photothrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the suitability of the MCAO model for studies on preventive or therapeutic compounds related to functional recovery, although the photothrombosis model might be useful to generate focused lesions leading to the location-related behavioural changes </plain></SENT>
