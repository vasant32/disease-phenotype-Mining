<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare and contrast the physical characteristics of balloon catheter systems used for temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Commonly used temporary occlusion systems were evaluated to determine: (a) balloon compliance; (b) balloon diameter versus volume; (c) balloon pressure versus volume; (d) simulated vessel wall pressure versus volume; (e) balloon failure volume; and (f) balloon deflation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observations were made concerning construction differences that affect the potential safety of a balloon system or the way it is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The nondetachable balloon system demonstrating the best compliance characteristics and lowest radial pressure generation was the nondetachable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon (Interventional Therapeutics Corporation, San Francisco, Calif) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diameter versus volume curves for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> systems reveal an initial nonlinear expansion that could contribute to vessel overexpansion during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon systems vary in construction, method of introduction, and compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of these characteristics, as well as of nonlinear balloon expansion, should aid balloon selection and appropriate use while helping to minimize complications </plain></SENT>
