<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established by autologous blood clots, different doses of micro-plasmin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg x kg(-1)) were administered into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> intra-arterial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve hours after administration of micro-plasmin, the neurological deficit score of rats was recorded and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> time (BT), fibrin degradation product (FDP) concentration in serum and thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen (FIB) concentration in plasma were tested after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial administration of micro-plasmin could reduce significantly neurological deficit score and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FDP concentration increased significantly as compared with model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in TT, PT and BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FIB concentration reduced markedly as compared with model group, but had no significant difference as compared with sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that micro-plasmin is effective in treatment of rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and has no significant influence on fibrinolytic system and blood clotting system, indicating that micro-plasmin may be useful for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and not lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Micro-plasmin seems to be distinguished from clinical used rt-PA by its no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> effect </plain></SENT>
