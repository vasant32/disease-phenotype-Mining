<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence as well as post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanisms that render diabetics to increased brain damage, we evaluated the effect of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The db/db mouse is a model of type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with four times higher blood sugar than its normoglycemic genetic control(db/+ mouse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the db/db mice showed significantly higher mortality, bigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, worsened neurological status compared to db/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The db/db mice also showed significantly higher post-ischemic inflammatory markers (ICAM1(+) capillaries, extravasated macrophages/neutrophils and exacerbated proinflammatory gene expression) compared to db/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the post-ischemic neuroprotective heat-shock chaperone gene expression was curtailed in the db/db compared to db/+ mice </plain></SENT>
