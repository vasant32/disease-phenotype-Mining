<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> dizolcipine (MK-801), a very potent neuroprotective drug, was used as positive reference compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">Isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats had the middle cerebral artery occluded using either an intravasal or an extravasal technique, because pilot experiments had shown differences in the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for the two middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK-801, 500 microg kg(-1) min(-1), or saline was administered i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>30 min after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ACTH-(4-9) analogue/saline group, 10 and 150 microg/kg of the analogue, or saline was injected s.c. both directly after and 24 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ACTH-(4-9) analogue treatment had no effect on the infarction volume in either model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, whereas MK-801 caused a significant reduction in the volume of cortical infarction in both models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, although ORG 2766 is known to enhance the recovery from experimentally induced lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system through a neurotrophic action and has proven to have significant beneficial effects on peripheral nerve regeneration, it did not prevent ischemic neuronal damage after intravasal or extravasal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results with MK-801, which caused significant reductions in the volume of cortical infarction in both models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, with clearly the largest reduction in the intravasal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, again indicate that there are differences in the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> which the two models produce in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
