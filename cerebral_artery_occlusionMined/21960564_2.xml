<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, adult male mice were socially isolated (housed individually) or socially paired (housed with an ovariectomized female); social pairing increased hypothalamic OT gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a causal relationship exists between increased OT and improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome, mice were treated with exogenous OT or OT receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> beginning 1 week before induction of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> via middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to social isolation, social housing attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, neuroinflammation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the neuroprotective effect of social housing was eliminated by receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, administration of OT to socially isolated mice reproduced the neuroprotection conferred by social housing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further report evidence for a direct suppressive action of OT on cultured microglia, which is a key instigator in the development of neuroinflammation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that OT mediates the neuroprotective effect of social interaction on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
