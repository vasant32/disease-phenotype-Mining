<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model designed for magnetic resonance imaging was developed in Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) to characterize serial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This model produces a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion sizes which closely mimics human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the care of animals undergoing this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> procedure, the range of outcomes we experienced and the cause of mortality in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anesthesia was induced with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and ketamine and maintained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature and end tidal <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were monitored continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was created by occluding a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During catheter placement animals were heparinized and vasospasm was minimized using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi> induction and maintenance were smooth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals with small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> showed very rapid recovery, were able to ambulate and self-feed within 2 hours of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of &gt;or=4% of the hemispheric volume required lengthy observation during recovery and parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> coupled with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of any size was acutely fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the absence of an effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, the spectrum of outcomes seen in our primate model is very similar to that observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
