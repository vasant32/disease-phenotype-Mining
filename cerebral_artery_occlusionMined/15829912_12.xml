<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative high-resolution (200 x 200 microm) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were measured on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and an automated clustering (ISODATA) technique was used to classify ischemic tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probability and probability density profiles were derived from a training data set (n=6) and probability maps of risk of subsequent infarction were computed in another group of animals (n=6) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictions were applied to overall tissue fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic) showed that prediction made based on combined <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF data outperformed those based on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> or CBF data alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the optimal operating points, combined <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF predicted tissue infarction with 86%+/-4% sensitivity and 89%+/-6% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, probability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P(I)) for different ISODATA-derived ischemic tissue types were also computed: (1) For the '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' cluster in the ischemic right hemisphere, P(I) based on combined <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF data (P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF]) accurately reflected tissue fate, whereas P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>] and P(I)[CBF] overestimated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) For the 'perfusion-diffusion mismatch' cluster, P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF] accurately predicted tissue fate, whereas P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>] underestimated and P(I)[CBF] overestimated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) For the core cluster, P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>+CBF], P(I)[<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>], and P(I)[CBF] prediction were high and similar ( approximately 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows an algorithm to statistically predict overall, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, ischemic core, and 'penumbral' tissue fate using early quantitative perfusion and diffusion information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this approach can be applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in a computationally inexpensive manner </plain></SENT>
