<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to ascertain the relative contribution of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) to lineages that repopulate the injured striatum following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We utilized a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-inducible Cre/loxP system under control of the nestin promoter, which provides permanent YFP labeling of multipotent nestin(+) SVZ-NSPCs prior to ischemic injury and continued YFP expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent progeny following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>YFP reporter expression was induced in adult male nestin-CreER(T2):R26R-YFP mice by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> administration (180 mg kg(-1), daily for 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days later, mice were subjected to 60-min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and sacrificed at 2 days, 2 weeks, or 6 weeks post-MCAO for phenotypic fate mapping of YFP(+) cells using lineage-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Migration of YFP(+) cells from SVZ into the injured striatal parenchyma was apparent at 2 and 6 weeks, but not 2 days, post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks post-MCAO, the average percent distribution of YFP(+) cells within the injured striatal parenchyma was as follows: 10% Dcx(+) neuroblasts, 15-20% oligodendrocyte progenitors, 59% GFAP(+) astrocytes, and only rare NeuN(+) postmitotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar phenotypic distribution was observed at 6 weeks, except for an increased average percentage of YFP(+) cells that expressed Dcx(+) (20%) or NeuN (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>YFP(+) cells did not express endothelial markers, but displayed unique anatomical relationships with striatal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that nestin(+) NSPCs within the SVZ mount a multilineage response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that includes a gliogenic component more predominant than previously appreciated </plain></SENT>
