<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The degree of recovery of the somatosensory cortical evoked response following a period (15 to 65 minutes) of partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, produced by temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), was assessed in baboons and related to the local tissue blood flow and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> before, during and after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow was measured using the technique of two-minute hydrogen clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failure of complete recovery of the evoked response was associated with significantly greater depths of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during occlusion, and with significantly greater and persisting tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> after occlusion, than complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery of the evoked response also was associated with tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduced postocclusive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> levels associated with incomplete recovery of the evoked response suggest that reduced perfusion during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was sufficiently severe to cause some degree of irreversible anoxic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of a brief (three to ten minutes) period of ventilation with air (instead of oxygen) under such low-flow conditions was to depress the evoked response significantly further; normally perfused brain, however, was unaffected by this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding has clinical implications in regard to normobaric oxygen therapy </plain></SENT>
