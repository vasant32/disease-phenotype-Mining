<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A water suppressing spin-echo sequence was used at 4.7 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase encoding during the spin-echo delay (TE = 272 ms) yielded an 8 x 8 array of 35 microL voxels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The injured area of the brain had a higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level and markedly lower N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> levels than did the non-ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spectroscopic imaging data clearly showed the localization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, which agreed well with both magnetic resonance imaging and the histological data obtained post-mortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of combining magnetic resonance imaging and 1H spectroscopic imaging for studying animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and indicates the suitability of the technique for further pharmacological approaches </plain></SENT>
