<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group (n = 10), the model group (n = 45), and the SA group (n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established using the modified suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No suture or perfusion was given to rats in the sham-operation group, but these rats received the same procedures as those for modeled rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After modeling routine feeding was given to rats in the model group and the sham-operative group without any other treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SA was successively given to rats in the SA group after successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion, once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by peritoneally injecting bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at the dose of 50 mg/kg on the 7th (T1), 14th day (T2), and 28th day (T3) after modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological severity score (NSS) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BrdU positive cells and the BrdU/PSA-NCAM positive cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) were counted using immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group at the same time points, the NSS decreased in the SA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant difference was shown at T3 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with the sham-operative group at the same time point, the BrdU positive cells and BrdU/PSA-NCAM positive cells of the model group obviously increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group at the same time point, the BrdU positive cells and BrdU/ PSA-NCAM positive cells of the SA group obviously increased, showing significant difference (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SA could promote the proliferation and migration of endogenous NSCs, which may possibly be one of its mechanisms in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
