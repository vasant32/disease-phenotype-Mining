<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation with different exercise paradigms has been investigated, but which one is more effective in facilitating motor recovery and up-regulating brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> would be interesting to clinicians and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Voluntary exercise, forced exercise, and involuntary muscle movement caused by functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been individually demonstrated effective as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these three common interventions on brain BDNF changes and motor recovery levels using a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: One hundred and seventeen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Control (Con), Voluntary exercise of wheel running (V-Ex), Forced exercise of treadmill running (F-Ex), and Involuntary exercise of FES (I-Ex) with implanted electrodes placed in two hind limb muscles on the affected side to mimic gait-like walking pattern during stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats with the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion model and fifty-seven rats had motor deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, rats were arranged to their intervention programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>De Ryck's behavioral test was conducted daily during the 7-day intervention as an evaluation tool of motor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> concentration and BDNF levels in the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex were measured after the rats were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>V-Ex had significantly better motor recovery in the behavioral test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>V-Ex also had significantly higher hippocampal BDNF concentration than F-Ex and Con </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>F-Ex had significantly higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> level than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Voluntary exercise is the most effective intervention in upregulating the hippocampal BDNF level, and facilitating motor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rats that exercised voluntarily also showed less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> stress response than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results also suggested that the forced exercise group was the least preferred intervention with high stress, low brain BDNF levels and less motor recovery </plain></SENT>
