<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), traditionally viewed as an axon/dendrite specification and axonal growth protein, has emerged as nidus in regulation of both pre- and post-synaptic Ca ( 2+) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Building on our discovery of the interaction and regulation of Ca ( 2+) channels by CRMP-2, we recently identified a short sequence in CRMP-2 which, when appended to the transduction domain of HIV TAT protein, suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, inflammatory and neuropathic pain in vivo by functionally uncoupling CRMP-2 from the Ca ( 2+) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we also found that this region attenuated Ca ( 2+) influx via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methylD-Aspartate</z:chebi> receptors (NMDARs) and reduced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a moderate controlled cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to extend these findings by examining additional neuroprotective effects of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (TAT-CBD3) and exploring the biochemical mechanisms by which TAT-CBD3 targets NMDARs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that an intraperitoneal injection of TAT-CBD3 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in an animal model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was observed when TAT-CBD3 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was given either prior to or after occlusion but just prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a direct biochemical complex was not resolvable between the NMDAR subunit NR2B and CRMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular application of TAT-CBD3 failed to inhibit NMDAR current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NR2B interactions with the post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) remained intact and were not disrupted by TAT-CBD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> tiling of intracellular regions of NR2B revealed two 15-mer sequences, in the carboxyl-terminus of NR2B, that may confer binding between NR2B and CRMP-2 which supports CRMP-2's role in excitotoxicity and neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
