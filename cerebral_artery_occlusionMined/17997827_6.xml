<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Altered gene expression is an important feature of ischemic cerebral injury and affects proteins of many functional classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression at various times after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in human and rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results demonstrated a significant difference in the number of genes affected and the time-course of expression between the two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total number of deregulated genes in the rat was 335 versus 126 in the human, while, of 393 overlapping genes between the two array sets, 184 were changed only in the rat and 36 in the human with a total of 41 genes deregulated in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mean fold changes were much higher in the human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of novel genes, including p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) and integrase interactor 1, was further analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong neuronal staining was seen for PAK1 and MMP11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings confirmed previous studies reporting that gene expression screening can detect known and unknown transcriptional features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and highlight the importance of research using human brain tissue in the search for novel therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
