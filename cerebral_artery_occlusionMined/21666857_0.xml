<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define these profiles using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) for dual-parameter voxel analysis in the rat suture permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to pMCAO with MRI measurements of quantitative CBF and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> at baseline, over the first 4 h (n=9) and at 7, 14, and 21 days (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Voxel analysis of CBF and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was used to characterize brain tissue ischemic transitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Penumbra, core, and hyperemic infarction volumes were significantly elevated (P&lt;0.05) and unchanged over the first 4 h of pMCAO while the total lesion volume progressively rose </plain></SENT>
