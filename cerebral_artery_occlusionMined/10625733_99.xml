<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sex difference in ischemic brain injury in young animals disappears after surgical ovariectomy and can be restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether ischemic brain injury continues to be smaller in middle-aged, reproductively senescent female rats compared with age-matched males and to test the effect of ovarian steroids on brain injury after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of 16-month old Wistar rats (males [n=9], untreated females [n=9], and females pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> [25-microgram pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> [10-mg pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the intraluminal filament technique, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables and laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion were monitored throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort of males (n=3), untreated females (n=3), females pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (n=3), and females pretreated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (n=3), end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow was measured by [(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As predicted, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was not different between middle-aged male and female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were 21+/-5% and 31+/-6% of ipsilateral cerebral cortex, and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were 44+/-7% and 43+/-5% of ipsilateral striatum in males and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in reproductively senescent females (5+/-2% and 16+/-4% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>-treated groups, respectively, compared with 31+/-6% in untreated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was smaller in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>- but not in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative change in laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion from preischemic baseline and absolute end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow were not affected by hormonal treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the protection against ischemic brain injury found in young adult female rats disappears after reproductive senescence in middle-aged females and that ovarian hormones alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury in reproductively senescent female rats by a blood flow-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for hormone replacement therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury prevention in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
