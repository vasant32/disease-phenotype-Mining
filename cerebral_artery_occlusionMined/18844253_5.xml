<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection of TSA was investigated with respect to neurological deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analyses for malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) content and the inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) activity in brain tissue were performed at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the effects of TSA were tested in the cultured astrocytes exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25935">hydrogen dioxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TSA (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TSA also significantly increased the activity of SOD after 24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and decreased the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level, NO content, and iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the translocation of NF-kappaB was inhibited by TSA and the survival rate of astrocytes was markedly increased and the NO production was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results illustrated that TSA protected the brain from ischemic injury by suppressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and the radical-mediated inflammatory insult </plain></SENT>
