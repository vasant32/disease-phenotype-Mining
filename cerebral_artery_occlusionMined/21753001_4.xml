<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) are important regulators of cellular bioenergetics, have been implicated in brain susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (ASH), and could underlie the unfavorable prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rodents were exposed to either intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (IH) during sleep, a characteristic feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, or to sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (SH), and expression of MCT1 and MCT2 was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the functional recovery to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats and hMCT2 transgenic mice and of hippocampal slices subjected to ASH was assessed, as well as the effects of MCT blocker and MCT2 antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IH, but not SH, induced significant reductions in MCT2 expression over time at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels and in the functional recovery of hippocampal slices subjected to ASH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MCAO-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly greater in IH-exposed rats and mice, and overexpression of hMCT2 in mice markedly attenuated the adverse effects of IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in normoxic rats but not in IH-exposed rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, prolonged exposures to IH mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> are associated with increased <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> that is mediated, at least in part, by concomitant decreases in the expression and function of MCT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efforts to develop <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of MCT2 should provide opportunities to ameliorate the overall outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
