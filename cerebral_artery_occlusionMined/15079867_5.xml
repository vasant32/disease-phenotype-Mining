<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of immunophilin ligand GPI-1046 on ischemic brain injury, 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was carried out in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to cases treated with vehicle, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced greatly and rotamase activity was inhibited significantly at 24 hr of reperfusion by treatment with GPI-1046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity and the number of cells stained positively for FKBP12, FKBP52, caspase-8, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and caspase-3 were also reduced markedly in the brain after GPI-1046 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that GPI-1046 significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and provided neuroprotective effect on rats after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by inhibiting the increase of rotamase activity and of the number of FKBP12-, FKBP52-, caspase-8-, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-, and caspase-3-positive cells in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
