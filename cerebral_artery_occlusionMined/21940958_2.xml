<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) by IL-6 in the reactive oxygen species defense system after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tFCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-6 was injected in mice before and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed for analysis of an IL-6R association after tFCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary mouse cerebral cortical neurons were transfected with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probes targeted to IL-6Rα or gp130 and were used for chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay, luciferase promoter assay, and cell viability assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by IL-6 was measured after tFCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-6R was disrupted through a disassembly between IL-6Rα and gp130 associated by protein oxidation after reperfusion after tFCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and finally induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through a decrease in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, IL-6 injections prevented disruption of IL-6R against reperfusion after tFCI, consequently restoring activity of STAT3 through recovery of the binding of STAT3 to gp130 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-6 injections restored the transcriptional activity of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase promoter through recovery of the recruitment of STAT3 to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase promoter and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after tFCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that IL-6 has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury through IL-6R-mediated STAT3 activation and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase expression </plain></SENT>
