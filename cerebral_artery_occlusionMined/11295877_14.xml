<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work in primary cell culture has shown that TNF-alpha and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> are involved in the signaling that induces tolerance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (Ginis et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To validate the in vitro studies, the authors administered cell permeable analogs of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramides</z:chebi> intracisternally or intravenously to examine their effect on neuroprotection after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed at 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D-erythro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">N-acetylsphingosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi>) or its vehicle was infused intracisternally for 1 hour before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second set of studies, D-erythro-N-octanoylsphingosine (C8-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>) or its vehicle was injected intravenously 48 or 24 hours before MCAO to mimic preconditioning (PC) and was also injected 5 minutes after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi> infusion significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by approximately 14% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C8-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> injection reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes approximately 17% compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was constant and significant compared with controls over the time periods examined (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This work supports findings in primary brain cell cultures that implicate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> as a downstream signal that is proximate to development of tolerance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because the degree of protection represents approximately 50% of the maximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction observed in this model, there are probably additional signaling pathways that subserve tolerance </plain></SENT>
