<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, much of the current research focuses on treatments such as anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cell replacement strategies to minimize behavioral and physiological consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, intravenous delivery of human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) 48 h after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in a rat resulted in both behavioral and physiological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nissl and TUNEL staining demonstrated that many of the neurons in the core were rescued, indicating that while both necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, it is clear that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> plays a larger role than first anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, immunohistochemical and histochemical analysis showed a diminished and/or lack of granulocyte and monocyte infiltration and astrocytic and microglial activation in the parenchyma in animals treated with HUCBC 48 h poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment at this time point should offer encouragement to clinicians that a therapy with a broader window of efficacy may soon be available to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
