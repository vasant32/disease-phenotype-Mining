<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various neurobehavioral tasks have been developed to assess the motor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> associated with MCAO in rodents, and these studies have revealed deficits related to long-term sensorimotor function, as well as retention of spatial memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment of auditory processing in a MCAO model has not been undertaken, despite findings suggesting an auditory processing deficit in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, a common post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a modified pre-pulse inhibition paradigm, and other behavioral tasks thought to tap "language-related processing", adult male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to 60 minute MCAO or Sham surgery and were behaviorally assessed from P58 to P124 (2 to 65 days post-surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tasks were selected based on evidence that rapid auditory processing(2) (RAP) skills are associated with language processing indices in clinical populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and sensorimotor ability was evaluated using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, non-spatial water maze, and a post-injury rotarod task administered over multiple days (motor learning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined behavioral results from post-MCAO mice provide evidence of a RAP deficit as well as deficits in spatial, non-spatial, and motor learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall results support a fuller characterization of behavioral deficits in auditory processing after MCAO </plain></SENT>
