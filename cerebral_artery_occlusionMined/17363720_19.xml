<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Still, several issues, including optimal target temperature, remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal depth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four male Wistar rats (n=84) were subjected to filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty animals were equally split into 6 groups kept at core temperatures of 37 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 33 degrees C, and 32 degrees C over a period of 4 hours starting 90 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, after performing a neuroscore, animals were killed and brains examined for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and invasion of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second part, 24 animals (8 per group) were kept at 33 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 4 hours, allowed to survive for 5 days, and underwent additional investigation of transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first part, one animal in each treatment group and 2 animals in group 37 degrees C died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were smaller for 34 degrees C and 33 degrees C compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (P&lt;0.05) over 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These animals also had better functional outcome (P&lt;0.05) with an advantage for 34 degrees C versus 33 degrees C (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte count was lower for 34 degrees C and 33 degrees C as compared with the 37 degrees C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the second part of the study with an advantage for 34 degrees C versus 33 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the optimal depth of therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is 34 degrees C </plain></SENT>
