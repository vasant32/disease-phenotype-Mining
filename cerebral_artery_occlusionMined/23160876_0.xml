<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The rationale for recanalization therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is to preserve brain through penumbral salvage and thus improve clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the relationship between recanalization, clinical outcomes, and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients presenting with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent endovascular therapy and post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 201 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with other occlusive lesions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical/radiological characteristics, procedural outcomes (including thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> scores), clinical outcome scores (modified Rankin scores), and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes on diffusion weighted imaging were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively collected database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome is defined as 90-day modified Rankin score≤2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful recanalization (thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> grade 2b or 3) was achieved in 63.2% and favorable outcomes in 46% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 50.1 mL in recanalized versus 133.9 mL in non-recanalized patients (P&lt;0.01) and 40.4 mL in patients with favorable outcomes versus 111.8 in patients with unfavorable outcomes (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>≥2b, baseline National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early Computed Tomography scores, and age were identified as independent predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were included in the analysis only final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and age remained significantly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Successful recanalization leads to improved functional outcomes through a reduction in final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our series, age and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but not recanalization were found to be independent predictors of outcome, supporting the use of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as surrogate marker of outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
