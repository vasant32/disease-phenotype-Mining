<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other hematopoietic stem cells, like the human umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells (hUCBs), and nonhematopoietic stem cells have been shown to improve motor function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we transplanted either G-CSF-mobilized PBPCs or hUCBs in rats 24 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and assessed their behavioral abnormalities in spontaneous activity and spontaneous motor asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both transplanted groups of rats we observed a significant reduction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> compared with nontransplanted, stroked animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, transplantation of G-CSF PBPC and hUCB cells prevented the development of extensive motor asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings raise the possibility that PBPCs could provide a novel transplantation therapy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
