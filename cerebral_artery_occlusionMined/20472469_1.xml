<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 36 male Wistar/ST rats were subjected to MCAO or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After MCAO or sham surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were provided liquid feed for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were divided into 3 groups: the solid feeding group, the liquid feeding group, and the solid feeding group of sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effect of mastication on functional recoveries after permanent MCAO in rats was evaluated by the limb placement test and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After surgery, limb placement test scores were equal in both MCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the acquisition trials of MWM task, statistically significant differences in escape latency were observed between the liquid feeding group and sham groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> days, and between the solid feeding group and sham groups at days 3 and 4 of the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the probe trial, statistically significant differences in time spent were observed between the liquid feeding group and sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 5 of acquisition trials, the time spent in the periphery of the pool in MWM task was significantly different among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggested that solid diet mastication could be effective for the rehabilitation of sensorimotor and learning/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
