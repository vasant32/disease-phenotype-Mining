<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of phospholipases in neuronal injury after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or saline (of equal volume), was administered upon reperfusion to rats that underwent 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) via the intraluminal filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were graded for neurological deficits based on a scale of 0-4, where 0 indicates no visible neurological deficits and 4 indicates most severe neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, both groups of rats showed similar degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, receiving median scores of 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after 24 h of reperfusion the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> treated rats (n = 18) showed significantly lower deficit scores compared to the saline controls (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median scores were 1 and 3 and mean ranks were 12.28 and 23.14, respectively (P &lt; 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> persisted for up to 7 days when the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> treated rats continued to receive a median score of 1, whereas the saline treated rats received a median score of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean ranks were significantly lower in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> group (14.68) compared to the saline controls (21.54) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the last neurological test was conducted, the rats were sacrificed and their brains embedded in paraffin for histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">Quinacrine</z:chebi> treated rats showed significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in the caudoputamen compared to saline treated rats (P &lt; 0.05, Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When both cortical and striatal damage were summed, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8711">quinacrine</z:chebi> treated animals also exhibited a significantly lower degree of damage compared to saline controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study supports the notion that PLA2 plays an important role in the development of neuronal injury following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
