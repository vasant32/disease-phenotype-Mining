<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine these properties, we observed post-ischemic 5-LOX changes from 3 h to 14 days after reperfusion in rats with transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of 5-LOX, both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, was increased in the ischemic core 12-24 h after reperfusion, and in the boundary zone adjacent to the ischemic core 7-14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased 5-LOX was primarily localized in the neurons in the ischemic core at 24 h, but in the proliferated astrocytes in the boundary zone 14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As 5-LOX metabolites, the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> in the ischemic brain was substantially increased 3 h to 24 h, near control at 3 days, and moderately increased again 7 days after reperfusion; whereas the level of LTB(4) was increased mildly 3 h but substantially 7-14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that 5-LOX expression and the enzymatic activity are increased after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and spatio-temporally involved in neuron injury in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and astrocyte proliferation in the late phase </plain></SENT>
