<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the study reported here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under various experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients often develop mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> that increases the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and worsens the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the neuroprotective effect of PACAP38 in normothermic and moderately hyperthermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was more extensive in the hyperthermic animals, but PACAP38 significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, measured 48 h after MCAO, in both the normothermic and the moderately hyperthermic animals, by more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a significant neuroprotection with PACAP38 could only be demonstrated when animals with no definite <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp> behavior and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> were excluded from the evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> did not influence the effect of PACAP38, but animals with questionable brain damage or <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> must be excluded from the sample in order to demonstrate the neuroprotection with PACAP38 </plain></SENT>
