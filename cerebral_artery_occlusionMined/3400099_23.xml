<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of U74006F on the early ionic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous doses of 3 mg/kg U74006F were given 10 minutes and 3 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+, and water at and around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by wet-dry weight measurements 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle treatment, U74006F treatment reduced brain water entry, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> accumulation, K+ loss, and net ion shift by 25-50% in most brain areas sampled in the frontal and parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, reductions of ionic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were most prominent and reached significance (p less than 0.005, unpaired two-tailed t test) mostly in the frontoparietal and parietal cortex areas adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that a steroid drug without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> activity can reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> but that the effects are largely limited to tissues in which collateral blood flow may be present </plain></SENT>
