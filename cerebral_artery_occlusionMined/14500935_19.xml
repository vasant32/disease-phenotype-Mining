<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach requires early determination of both irreversible (core) and reversible (penumbra) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using established perfusion thresholds, we characterized the relationship among core, penumbra, and brain tissue perfused above penumbral thresholds (non-core/non-penumbra [NC/NP]) in 36 patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stem occlusion who underwent quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) assessment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While great variability in the mean+/-SD percentage of core (37.6+/-18.7) and NC/NP (30.3+/-16.6) was observed, the percentage of penumbra was relatively constant from individual to individual, constituting approximately one third of the cortical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (32.1+/-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariable and multivariable analyses, percent core and not percent penumbra was significantly associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, penumbra is consistently present within a relatively narrow range, despite great variability in the size of core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may explain why the core and not the penumbra is the main determinant of outcome in our group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion should ideally be guided by diagnostic methods capable of rapidly and reliably identifying irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
