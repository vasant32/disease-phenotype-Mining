<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our analysis by quantitative in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy was concentrated on cerebrocortical areas that survive primary infarction but undergo secondary damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, SP-encoding preprotachykinin-A and NK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and SP-like immunoreactivity were transiently increased in GABAergic interneurons at 2 d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coincidently, MCAO caused a marked expression of SP and NK1 in a subpopulation of glutamatergic pyramidal cells, and in some neurons SP and NK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were coinduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of the NKB-encoding preprotachykinin-B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and of NKB-like immunoreactivity at 2 and 7 d after MCAO were confined to GABAergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the expression of NK3 was markedly downregulated in pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO caused transient NK1 expression in activated cerebrovenular endothelium within and adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK1 expression was absent from activated astroglia or microglia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transient induction of NK1 in cerebrovenular endothelium may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and leukocyte diapedesis </plain></SENT>
