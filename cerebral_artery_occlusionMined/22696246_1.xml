<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oxidative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> damage play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi> and the underlying mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">Luteolin</z:chebi> was injected intraperitoneally at different doses of 10 or 25 mg/kg immediately after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi>'s neuroprotective effect was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated at 24 and 72 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SOD1, Bcl-2, and Bax expression were measured by immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi>'s anti-oxidative activities were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SOD1, CAT activities, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content were measured by spectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Experiment 3, the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi> on claudin-5 was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with MCAO group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi> significantly increased the activities of SOD1, CAT, Bcl-2 and claudin-5 (P &lt; 0.05), decreased the levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and Bax (P &lt; 0.05), and alleviated the neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and brain water content (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15864">luteolin</z:chebi> protected the brain from ischemic damage, and this effect may be through reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and upregulation of the expressions of claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
