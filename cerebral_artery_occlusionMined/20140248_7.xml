<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its inhibitors contribute to neurite outgrowth in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) after treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo, administration of MSCs to mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) significantly increased activation of tPA and downregulated PAI-1 levels in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) compared with control PBS treated mice, concurrently with increases of myelinated axons and synaptophysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, MSCs significantly increased tPA levels and concomitantly reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) expression in astrocytes under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ELISA analysis of conditioned medium revealed that MSCs stimulated astrocytes to secrete tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When primary cortical neurons were cultured in the conditioned medium from MSC co-cultured astrocytes, these neurons exhibited a significant increase in neurite outgrowth compared to conditioned medium from astrocytes alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blockage of tPA with a neutralizing antibody or knock-down of tPA with siRNA significantly attenuated the effect of the conditioned medium on neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of recombinant human tPA into cortical neuronal cultures also substantially enhanced neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the MSC mediated increased activation of tPA in astrocytes promotes neurite outgrowth after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
