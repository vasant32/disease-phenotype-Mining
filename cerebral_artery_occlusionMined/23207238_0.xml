<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No studies analyze the influence of the hyperintense vessel (HV) sign on the speed of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> progression during the first hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the association of the HV sign with progression of infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: From a prospectively derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database, we retrospectively selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of the anterior circulation admitted to our comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center with available baseline CT scan and a multimodal MRI carried out thereafter to make a decision about endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression of the ischemic area was calculated as the difference in the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Scan (ASPECTS) score between CT scan and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>Slow progression</z:hpo> was considered as no change or 1 point decrease on the ASPECTS score between both exams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of HV on FLAIR sequence was graded as absent, subtle or prominent by two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 70 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean time between baseline CT and MRI was 124 Â± 82 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ASPECTS score on baseline CT was 10 in 34% of patients, 9 in 49% and 8 or less in 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ASPECTS score was 2 (1-3) points lower in the DWI and this decrease did not correlate with the time elapsed between the two exams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Distal HV sign was observed in 57/70 (81%) patients (subtle in 33 and prominent in 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HV was more frequently observed in patients with proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no differences regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and ASPECTS score on baseline CT between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with prominent HV showed a lower progression of the ischemic area [median ASPECTS score decrease, 1 (1-0)] compared with patients with subtle HV [median ASPECTS score decrease, 2 (2-1)] and patients with absence of HV [median ASPECTS score decrease, 3 (4-3)] (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prominent HV was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted by systolic blood pressure on admission, site of occlusion and time elapsed between both neuroimaging exams compared to the absence of HV (OR, 16.2; 95% CI, 2.1-123.1) and to subtle HV sign (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.5-23.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: HV sign on FLAIR, especially if prominent, is associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of the ischemic area in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This radiological sign may predict the speed of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> progression, opening an opportunity for reperfusion therapies in longer time windows </plain></SENT>
