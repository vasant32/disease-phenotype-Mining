<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n = 14) were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, induced by intracarotid insertion of a filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion (n = 14) and perfusion (n = 7) weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed before, and at various time points after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, ranging from 30 min up to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the temporal profiles of Dw differ between the severely and the least damaged regions of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the core of the lesion, where the tissue evolved to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, Dw declined significantly (P &lt; 0.001) within 0.5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and remained depressed until 24 h after withdrawal of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no statistically significant decline in Dw was found in the perifocal regions containing morphologically intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI qualitatively exhibited a hypoperfusion and reperfusion during, and after 2 h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant (r &gt; or = 0.71, P &lt; 0.01) correlation was found between delta Dw (the difference in Dw between the ipsilateral ischemic and homologous contralateral control regions) obtained immediately before withdrawal of the suture (2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and at specific early time points after withdrawal of the suture, and the degree of ischemic cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant (P &gt; 0.01) correlation was detected at an early time points of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or at other time points after withdrawal of the suture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
