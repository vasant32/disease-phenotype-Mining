<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the paper is to determine the speed of the neurological response to cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by monitoring transient changes in somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SEPs, continuously monitored during temporary clipping of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in anaesthetised cats, are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SEP signals are modelled by a quasi-periodic Fourier series, the coefficients of which are estimated with the aid of two adaptive least squares estimation algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The energy levels at various harmonics throughout the protocol are obtained directly from the filter weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noise covariance is estimated from pre-stimulus recording, and the adaptation rate of the algorithm is adjusted sweep-by-sweep to accommodate transient changes in the pre-stimulus noise level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the occlusion, a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in SEP amplitude is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The change in latency is not statistically significant (p approximately equal to 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spectral trends show a sudden decline in energy at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> harmonics immediately following occlusion, although when the amplifier bandwidth is changed to 5-1500 Hz (from an initial setting of 30-1500 Hz), the fundamental frequency component of the SEP signal shows the greatest responsiveness to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average time constant of the decline in amplitude resulting from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is only 10.6 +/- 4.0 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that rapid detection of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> may be feasible by continuously monitoring SEP signals and analysing transient changes in time and frequency domains </plain></SENT>
