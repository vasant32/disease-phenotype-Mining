<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific mechanisms involved in their migration to lesions are still to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after reperfusion, human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) were transplanted by intravenous injection to explore the effects of fractalkine/CX3CR1 on the migration of transplanted MSCs to lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro study using real-time PCR and western blot revealed that CX3CR1, the only known receptor of fractalkine, was expressed in cultured hMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of fractalkine in the ischemic brain was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The directional migration of transplanted hMSCs to the damaged region was observed through detection of green fluorescence protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated the cells were mainly distributed in the ischemic boundary zone with high fractalkine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a further study, lentivirus-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference of CX3CR1 expression was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of these experiments indicated that CX3CR1 knock-down dramatically decreased the migration of hMSCs to the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that fractalkine and its specific receptor CX3CR1 are involved in the directional migration of transplanted MSCs to the ischemic damaged brain region </plain></SENT>
