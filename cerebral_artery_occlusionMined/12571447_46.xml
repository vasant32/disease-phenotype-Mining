<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a purified monoclonal anti-Nogo-A antibody (7B12) was evaluated in two rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models with a time-to-treatment of 24 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After photothrombotic cortical injury (PCI) and intraventricular infusion of a control mouse immunoglobulin G for 2 weeks, long-term contralateral forepaw function was reduced to about 55% of prelesion performance until the latest time point investigated (9 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forepaw function was significantly better in the 7B12-treated group 6 to 9 weeks after PCI, and reached about 70% of prelesion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were also produced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, forepaw function remained between 40% and 50% of prelesion levels 4 to 12 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 7B12-treated groups showed significant improvement between 4 and 7 weeks after MCAO from around 40% of prelesion levels at week 4 to about 60% to 70% at 7 to 12 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment in both models was efficacious without influencing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuroanatomically in the spinal cord, a significant increase of midline crossing corticospinal fibers originating in the unlesioned sensorimotor cortex was found in 7B12-treated groups, reaching 2.3 +/- 1.5% after PCI (control group: 1.1 +/- 0.5%) and 4.5 +/- 2.2% after MCAO in SHR rats (control group: 1.8 +/- 0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Behavioral outcome and the presence of midline crossing fibers in the cervical spinal cord correlated significantly, suggesting a possible contribution of the crossing fibers for forepaw function after PCI and MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that specific anti-Nogo-A antibodies bear potential as a new rehabilitative treatment approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with a prolonged time-to-treatment window </plain></SENT>
