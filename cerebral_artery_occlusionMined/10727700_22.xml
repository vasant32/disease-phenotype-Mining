<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to either 30 min or 120 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological and functional tests including, gross neurological score, and rotarod and adhesive removal tests were performed at various time points up to 21 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between groups of animals were detected using the rotarod and adhesive removal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between lesion volume and adhesive removal test was detected in rats subjected to 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that quantitative rotarod and adhesive removal tests measure different aspects of functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and both are useful in characterizing functional recovery from an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
