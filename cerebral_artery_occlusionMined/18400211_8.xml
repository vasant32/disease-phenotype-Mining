<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to further investigate the neuroprotective effects of FA during reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 90 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; they were then sacrificed after 2, 10, 24 and 36 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected using semi-quantitative RT-PCR at 2 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mac-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> (4-HNE), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), active caspase 3, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and TUNEL positive cells were measured at 2, 10, 24 and 36 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FA (100 mg/kg, i.v.) administered immediately after MCAo inhibited ICAM-1 and Mac-1 mRNA expression in the striatum at 2 h of reperfusion, and reduced the number of Mac-1, 4-HNE and 8-OHdG positive cells in the ischemic rim and core at 10, 24 and 36 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FA decreased TUNEL positive cells in the penumbra at 10 h, and in the ischemic boundary and core at 24 and 36 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FA curtailed active caspase 3 expression in the penumbra at 10 h and restored NeuN-labeled neurons in the penumbra and ischemic core at 36 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FA decreased the level of ICAM-1 mRNA and the number of microglia/macrophages, and subsequently down-regulated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that FA provides neuroprotection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by inhibiting ICAM-1 mRNA expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
