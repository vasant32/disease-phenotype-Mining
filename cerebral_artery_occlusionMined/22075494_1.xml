<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the neuroprotective potential of 3-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-7-nitroindazole (3-BNI), a potent and selective neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) inhibitor against ER stress and focal cerebral I/R injury associated with comorbid type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in-vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced by feeding high-fat diet and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (35 mg/kg) treatment in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and western blotting methods were employed for the detection and expression of ER stress/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> markers [78 kDa <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulated protein (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUNEL assay for DNA fragmentation was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The diabetic rats subjected to cerebral I/R had prominent neurological damage and functional deficits compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Massive DNA fragmentation was observed in ischemic penumbral region of diabetic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the enhanced immunoreactivity and expression of ER stress/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> markers were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3-BNI (30 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment significantly inhibited the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume and improved functional recovery of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection was further evident by lesser DNA fragmentation with a concomitant reduction of GRP78 and CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of 3-BNI in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model which may be partly due to inhibition of ER stress pathway involving CHOP </plain></SENT>
