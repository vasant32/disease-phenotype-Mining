<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PaCO2 was adjusted to one of four levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was determined in four cortical areas and white matter using the tissue fractionation of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine [( <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]IAP) in combination with vessel mapping using in vivo 4% thioflavine S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific PaCO2 reactivity and CBF were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the nonischemic cortex, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, although slightly depressed, in the border zone far from the ischemic core area, and depressed in the border zone adjacent to the ischemic core area (P less than 0.001) and the ischemic core (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In normocapnic and hypocapnic animals, CBF <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the form of regularly spaced CBF columns perpendicular to the cortical surface was observed in the nonischemic hemisphere but was absent in the ischemic core area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hypercapnic rats, flow columns were present in the ischemic core areas and border zones but were absent on the nonischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant interaction (P less than 0.0001) in observer-determined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> grades between PaCO2 level and each of three areas, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, border zone, and ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex, comparison of the thioflavine S-stained vessels with the flow columns provided evidence supporting the concept of capillary recruitment and cycling as a mode of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of flow columns in severely ischemic areas in hypercapnic animals indicates that a short period of high PaCO2 transiently augments microregional flow and could enhance the delivery of a therapeutic agent to these microregions of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The regional analysis of PaCO2 reactivity suggests an index of future tissue viability </plain></SENT>
