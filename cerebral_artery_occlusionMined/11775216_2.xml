<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively measure the temporal profiles of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein in mouse brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male CD-1 mice received 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour(s) of permanent MCAO with an intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree and the extent of occlusion were determined using a laser Doppler flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 positive expression in ischemic regions was determined immunohistochemically and ICAM-1 protein was quantitatively measured using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After MCAO, surface cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic hemisphere decreased to 9%-15% of the baseline in each time point of 7 to 8 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in CBF measurement during occlusion between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that ICAM-1 positive microvascular endothelial cells were observed both in the ischemic core and in the perifocal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for increasing expression of ICAM-1 positive microvascular endothelial cells from the ischemic core to the ischemic margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that ICAM-1 expression in the ischemic hemisphere began to increase 3 h after MCAO, peaked at 6 h to 12 h, and persisted to 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICAM-1 expression increases in mice with permanent MCAO because ICAM-1 can mediate leukocyte-endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 is one of the important factors participating in ischemic cerebral damage and pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
