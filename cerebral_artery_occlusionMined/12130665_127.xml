<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) protects neurons from injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, traumatic brain injury, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection is in part mediated by antiapoptotic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted parallel studies of rhEPO in a model of transient global <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> induced by raising intraocular pressure, which is a clinically relevant model for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed abundant expression of EPO receptor (EPO-R) throughout the ischemic retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutralization of endogenous EPO with soluble EPO-R exacerbated ischemic injury, which supports a crucial role for an endogenous EPO/EPO-R system in the survival and recovery of neurons after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of rhEPO before or immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> not only reduced histopathological damage but also promoted functional recovery as assessed by electroretinography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous EPO also significantly diminished terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> end labeling labeling of neurons in the ischemic retina, implying an antiapoptotic mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results further establish EPO as a neuroprotective agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
