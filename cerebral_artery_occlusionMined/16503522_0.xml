<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> control group and citicoline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the later two groups, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established by introducing an intraluminal filament into the left middle cerebral artery, and citicoline (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally once a day for 2 weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats in the sham-operation group were not subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spatial learning and memory functions of the rats were evaluated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test 15 days after MCAO for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rats in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> control group exhibited serious spatial learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in both place navigation test and spatial probe test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the former test, the mean escape latency of citicoline-treated rats were significantly shorter than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> control rats (P&lt;0.01), and in the latter test significant diffidence was noted between citicoline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> control groups in the percentage time spent in the former platform quadrant and frequency of crossing the former platform (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Citicoline can improve the spatial learning and memory function of rats after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
