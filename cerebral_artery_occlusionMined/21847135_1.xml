<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Addition of a small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> called ISG15 is known as ISGylation, which is an ubiquitin (ub)-like posttranslational modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We currently show that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in adult mice significantly induces cortical protein ISGylation between 6 and 24 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With two-dimensional western blotting, 45 proteins were observed to be significantly increased in ISGylation (by 1.8- to 9.7-fold) after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with sham control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunochemistry showed that ISGylated proteins are localized in neurons within the ipsilateral striatum and in astroglia within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex of ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When subjected to transient MCAO, ISG15(-/-) mice showed increased mortality, exacerbated infarction, and worsened neurologic recovery than did <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, mice lacking UBE1L (ub-activating enzyme E1-like protein, the first enzyme of the ISGylation cycle) also showed bigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> when subjected to transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow or other physiologic parameters were not significantly different in both knockouts compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that increased protein ISGylation might be an endogenous neuroprotective adaptation to minimize poststroke brain damage </plain></SENT>
