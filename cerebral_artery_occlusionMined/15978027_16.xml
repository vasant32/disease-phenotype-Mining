<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) increases oxygen supply to ischaemic areas and reduces neuronal cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of HBO treatment on <z:mp ids='MP_0008918'>microgliosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> in permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> have not been addressed so far, but might be critical for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and neuroprotection, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats with permanent MCAO to investigate the time window to start HBO and to compare the effects of different HBO treatment frequencies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and on differences with regard to <z:mp ids='MP_0008918'>microgliosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAO the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated from Nissl-stained brain sections by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBO significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when used as early as 15, 90 or 180 min post-MCAO by 24%, 16% and 13%, respectively, in the single-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repetitive HBO treatment (first HBO session 90 min after MCAO) was not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microglial cells and astrocytes were detected by cytochemical fluorescent labelling and confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the single-treatment group we observed significantly higher astrocyte immunoreactivity but decreased microglial density in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects of HBO treatment on glial cells were not present in rats where HBO did not reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (360 min after MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that HBO-induced suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0008918'>microgliosis</z:mp> and aggravated response of astrocytes might contribute to the reported beneficial effects of early HBO treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
