<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment induced tolerance against cerebral ischemic injury, but the mechanisms underlying this effect of EA are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the effect of EA pretreatment on the expression of α7 nicotinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors (α7nAChR), using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, we investigated the role of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in neuroprotection mediated by the α7nAChR and EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were treated with EA at the acupoint "Baihui (GV 20)" 24 h before focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> which was induced for 120 min by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and HMGB1 levels were evaluated after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The α7nAChR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> PHA-543613 and the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ��-bungarotoxin (α-BGT) were used to investigate the role of the α7nAChR in mediating neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The roles of the α7nAChR and HMGB1 release in neuroprotection were further tested in neuronal cultures exposed to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that the expression of α7nAChR was significantly decreased after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EA pretreatment prevented the reduction in neuronal expression of α7nAChR after reperfusion in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with PHA-543613 afforded neuroprotective effects against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, EA pretreatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved neurological outcome, inhibited neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and HMGB1 release following reperfusion, and the beneficial effects were attenuated by α-BGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The HMGB1 levels in plasma and the penumbral brain tissue were correlated with the number of apoptotic neurons in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OGD in cultured neurons triggered HMGB1 release into the culture medium, and this effect was efficiently suppressed by PHA-543,613 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with α-BGT reversed the inhibitory effect of PHA-543,613 on HMGB1 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that EA pretreatment strongly protects the brain against transient cerebral ischemic injury, and inhibits HMGB1 release through α7nAChR activation in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the novel potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> interventions harnessing the anti-inflammatory effects of α7nAChR activation, through acupuncture or pharmacological strategies </plain></SENT>
