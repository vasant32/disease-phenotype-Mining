<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fractalkine is a recently identified chemokine that exhibits cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and chemoattractive properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It represents a unique member of the chemokine superfamily because it is located predominantly in the brain in which it is expressed constitutively on specific subsets of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the possible role of neuronally expressed fractalkine in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to neuronal injury, we have analyzed the regulation of fractalkine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and protein cleavage under conditions of neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding fractalkine is unaffected by experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in vitro, levels of fractalkine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were unaffected by ensuing excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when analyzed at the protein level, we found that fractalkine is rapidly cleaved from cultured neurons in response to an excitotoxic stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More specifically, fractalkine cleavage preceded actual neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by 2-3 hr, and, when evaluated functionally, fractalkine represented the principal chemokine released from the neurons into the culture medium upon an excitotoxic stimulus to promote chemotaxis of primary microglial and monocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that cleavage of neuron-derived, chemoattractive fractalkine can be prevented by inhibition of matrix metalloproteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that dynamic proteolytic cleavage of fractalkine from neuronal membranes in response to a neurotoxic insult, and subsequent chemoattraction of reactive immune cells, may represent an early event in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
