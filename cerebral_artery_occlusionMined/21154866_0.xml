<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous studies on a rat model of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the blood and brain concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid</z:chebi> (Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) following intravenous bolus injection were repeatedly assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, and blood-to-brain influx rate constants (K(i)) were calculated from Patlak plots of the data in areas with blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For concurrent validation of these findings, after completing the DCE-MRI study, radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> or α-aminoisobutyric acid was injected intravenously, and the brain disposition and K(i) values were calculated by quantitative autoradiography (QAR) assay employing the single-time equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To overcome two of the shortcomings of this comparison, the present experiments were carried out with a radiotracer virtually identical to Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, Gd-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, and K(i) was calculated from both sets of data by the single-time equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol included 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 2.5 h of reperfusion in male Wistar rats (n = 15) preceding the DCE-MRI Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> and QAR Gd-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to K(i), the tissue-to-blood concentration ratios, or volumes of distribution (V(R)), were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> opening were similar on the MRI maps and autoradiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within them, V(R) was nearly identical for Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> and Gd-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, and K(i) was slightly, but not significantly, higher for Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> than for Gd-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The K(i) values were well correlated (r��= 0.67; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the arterial concentration-time curve of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> was adjusted to match that of Gd-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, the two sets of K(i) values were equal and statistically comparable with those obtained previously by Patlak plots (the preferred, less model-dependent, approach) of the same data (p = 0.2-0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that this DCE-MRI technique accurately measures the Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> concentration in blood and brain, and that K(i) estimates based on such data are good quantitative indicators of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> injury </plain></SENT>
