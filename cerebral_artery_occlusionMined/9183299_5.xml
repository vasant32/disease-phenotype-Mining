<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> SD were monitored during the initial 15 minutes after remotely induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using serial diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were calculated and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases were monitored over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyperglycemic rats (n = 6) had a significant prolongation of the time from induction of MCAO to the start of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease as compared with normoglycemic control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time to the maximal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease was significantly delayed and recovery of transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> declines in the area adjacent to the ischemic core was significantly faster in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> delays the terminal depolarization in the ischemic core and supports a faster repolarization in severely mal-perfused penumbral tissue after SD, which reflects the increased availability of energy substrates in the state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
