<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 5 mg/kg MK-801 was administered intravenously to the MK-801 group (n = 12), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was given to the control group (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hour after the occlusion in each group, regional cerebral blood flow was determined in six rats using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine, and regional arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined using a microspectrophotometric technique in the other six rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both groups of animals, the cerebral blood flow of the ischemic cortex was significantly lower than that of the contralateral cortex (36 +/- 16 [SD] and 67 +/- 14 ml/min/100 g for the control group; 33 +/- 10 and 58 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g for the MK-801 group, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxygen extraction was significantly higher in the ischemic cortex (8.8 +/- 2.1 ml O2/100 ml blood) than in the contralateral cortex (5.6 +/- 0.3) for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, for the MK-801 group, there was no significant difference between the ischemic cortex (6.1 +/- 1.0) and the contralateral cortex (5.7 +/- 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oxygen extraction in the ischemic cortex of the MK-801 group was significantly lower than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculated ischemic regional oxygen consumption was similar to the nonischemic values in the control group, whereas the ischemic value was reduced to 61% of the value of the contralateral cortex in the MK-801 group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
