<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, C3-deficient mice showed significant improvement in survival, neurological deficit, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, P-selectin protein expression was undetectable in the cerebral microvasculature of C3-deficient mice following reperfusion, and there was reduced neutrophil influx, reduced microthrombus formation, and increased blood flow postreperfusion in C3-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the use of a novel complement inhibitory protein in a therapeutic paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complement receptor 2 (CR2)-Crry inhibits complement activation at the C3 stage and targets to sites of complement activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice with CR2-Crry at 30 min postreperfusion resulted in a similar level of protection to that seen in C3-deficient mice in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above-measured parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate an important role for complement in cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-selectin expression in the cerebrovasculature, which is also implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury, was shown to be distal to and dependent on complement activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data also show that a CR2-targeted approach of complement inhibition provides appropriate bioavailability in cerebral injury to enable complement inhibition at a dose that does not significantly affect systemic levels of serum complement activity, a potential benefit for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients where immunosuppression would be undesirable due to significantly increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
