<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The early evolution of ischemic brain injury under normoglycemic and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced hyperglycemic plasma conditions was studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), or 1-h MCAO followed by reperfusion using the intraluminal suture insertion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into four groups each with eight rats: normoglycemia with permanent MCAO, normoglycemia with 1-h MCAO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with permanent MCAO, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with 1-h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) and T2-weighted images (T2WIs) were aquired every 1 h from 20 min until 6 h after MCAO, at which time cerebral plasma volume images (PVIs) were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue infarction was determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 7 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic damage, measured as the area of DWI and T2WI hyperintensity and tissue infarction, increased significantly in hyperglycemic rats in both permanent and transient MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO model, the maximal apparent water diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) decline under either normo- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was about 40%, but the speed of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> drop was faster in hyperlgycemic rats than in normoglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion after 1 h of MCAO in normoglycemic rats partly reversed the decline in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, whereas the low <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> area continued to expand after reperfusion in the hyperglycemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between the two hyperglycemic groups with either permanent MCAO or reperfusion, no significant difference was found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured at 7 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, reperfusion dramatically increased the extent and accelerated the development rate of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the hyperglycemic reperfusion group also dropped to a lower level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large "no-reflow" zone was found in the ischemic hemisphere in the hyperglycemic reperfusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study provides strong evidence to support that preischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> exacerbates ischemic damage in both transient and permanent MCAO models and demonstrates, using MRI, that reperfusion under preischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> accelerates the evolution of early ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
