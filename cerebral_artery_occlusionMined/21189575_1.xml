<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury group and Angelica-treated group rats was induced by 5/0 nylon suture for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reperfusion was conducted for three to four hours and five to six hours respectively following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2 weighted-imaging (T2WI) and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) were performed, to study the changes in imaging and neuronal metabolites N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>/phosphocreatine (Cr/ PCr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in blood flow speed were measured by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surface vascular density in right hemisphere were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hyperintense signals and volume in the right cerebrum in Angelica-treated group decreased compared with those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury group, the T2 values were decreased, and the level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> increased, the ratio of Cr/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and Cho/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> decreased </plain></SENT>
