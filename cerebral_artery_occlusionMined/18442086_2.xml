<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the properties of GFAP-expressing cells in adult mouse striatum using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain slices from transgenic animals expressing EGFP under GFAP promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under physiological conditions, two distinct populations of GFAP-EGFP cells could be identified: (1) brightly fluorescent cells had bushy processes, passive membrane properties, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter activity, and high gap junction coupling rate typical for classical astrocytes; (2) weakly fluorescent cells were characterized by thin, clearly distinguishable processes, voltage-gated currents, complex responses to kainate, and low coupling rate reminiscent of an astrocyte subtype recently described in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mild focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> confers delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion, brightly fluorescent cells were the dominant GFAP-EGFP population observed within the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the majority of these cells expressed voltage-gated channels, showed complex responses to kainate, and a high coupling rate exceeding that of brightly fluorescent control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A minority of cells had passive membrane properties and was coupled less compared with passive control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in the adult striatum, astrocytes undergo distinct pathophysiological changes after ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dominant population in the ischemic lesion constitutes a novel physiological phenotype unlike any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> astrocyte and generates a large syncytium which might be a neuroprotective response of reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
