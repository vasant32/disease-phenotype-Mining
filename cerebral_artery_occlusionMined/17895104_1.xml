<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent modification of the occluding suture by coating with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> has been shown to create more uniform <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the utility of this modification in murine models of both transient and permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, male C57B16J mice were subjected to reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) for 45 minutes (n=42), or to permanent MCAo (n=25), with an intraluminal monofilament suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three types of sutures were used: untreated, partially coated, and completely coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative changes in regional cerebral blood flow, severity of neurological deficits, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 24 hours after the ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals subjected to 45 minutes of temporary occlusion with completely coated poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> sutures had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of 13.8%+/-5% compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of 7.2%+/-4% in those subjected to partially coated sutures and 22.4%+/-6% in the group occluded with untreated sutures (P=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use of completely coated sutures resulted in significantly less reperfusion following suture removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control animals undergoing permanent occlusion with untreated sutures had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of 17%+/-7% compared with 14.1%+/-5% using completely coated sutures and 6.5%+/-3% in animals with partially coated sutures (P=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in cerebral blood flow between the experimental groups undergoing permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> coating of intraluminal sutures does not increase the consistency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in a murine model of temporary/permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are in marked contrast to findings in rats </plain></SENT>
