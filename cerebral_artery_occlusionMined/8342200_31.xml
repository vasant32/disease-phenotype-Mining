<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced extracranially by insertion of a nylon filament into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of rats were investigated: (1) rats (n = 10) subjected to normothermic (37 degrees C) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and normothermic reperfusion; and (2) rats (n = 10) subjected to normothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 1 hour of normothermic reperfusion followed by 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were killed 1 week after the experiment, and brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for evaluation of ischemic cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in normothermic rats involved 20.9 +/- 4.6% of the hemisphere, whereas hypothermic rats exhibited a significantly smaller (P &lt; .001) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 11.1 +/- 2.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of surviving (or structurally intact) neurons within large sections of the cortex and striatum were significantly greater for hypothermic compared with normothermic rats (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that postischemic induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly reduces ischemic cell damage after 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat, and that an interval of time of at least 1 hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exists in which hypothermic intervention is effective in either salvaging or postponing irreversible neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
