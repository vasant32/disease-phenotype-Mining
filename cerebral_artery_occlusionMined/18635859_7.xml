<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001847'>Brain inflammation</z:mp> is a hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, where it has been implicated in tissue damage as well as in repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imaging technologies that specifically visualize these processes are highly desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored whether the inflammatory receptor CD40 can be noninvasively and specifically visualized in mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody, which we labeled with the near-infrared fluorescence dye Cy5.5 (Cy5.5-CD40MAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and CD40-deficient mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were either intravenously injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb or control Cy5.5-IgGMAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive and ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging was performed after injection of the compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probe distribution and specificity was further assessed with single-plane illumination microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher fluorescence intensities over the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-affected hemisphere, compared to the contralateral side, were only detected noninvasively in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice that received Cy5.5-CD40MAb, but not in CD40-deficient mice injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb or in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice that were injected with Cy5.5-IgGMAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence showed an intense fluorescence within the ischemic territory only in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the brains of these mice, single-plane illumination microscopy demonstrated vascular and parenchymal distribution, and confocal microscopy revealed a partial colocalization of parenchymal fluorescence from the injected Cy5.5-CD40MAb with activated microglia and blood-derived cells in the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that a CD40-targeted fluorescent antibody enables specific noninvasive detection of the inflammatory receptor CD40 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using optical techniques </plain></SENT>
