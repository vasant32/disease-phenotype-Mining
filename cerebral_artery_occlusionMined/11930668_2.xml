<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A dual wavelength (760 nm and 850 nm) NIRS system measuring total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration changes was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were used to set up middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model that had a stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> focus on the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used NIRS to localize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> focus that was confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and triphenyltetrazonlium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> brain staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area and the geometric configuration of the NIRS topograms were compared with those from MRI and the anatomical samples for the same rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reconstructed NIRS topograms showed that there was an optical density decreased area on the left cortex of the rats with MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area as shown in NIRS images was 19.50 mm2 (19.50 +/- 0.35 mm2, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anatomical samples showed that the mean ischemic area located in the NIRS measurement area was 18.46 mm2 (18.46 +/- 0.38 mm2, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For MRI, the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area located in the NIRS measurement area was 20.71 mm2 (20.71 +/- 0.27 mm2, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among NIRS, MRI and anatomical samples (F(2,57) = 2.47, P &gt; 0.05) for defining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was a significant correlation among NIRS, MRI (r = 0.782, P &lt; 0.05) and anatomical sample (r = 0.851, P &lt; 0.05) for the same cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the location and geometric configuration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> focus shown by NIRS were identified by MRI and anatomical samples, though the NIRS images had worse spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NIRS showed a good agreement with MRI and anatomical samples in the ischemic area and location determination of the infarction focus for the rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that NIRS can non-invasively trace cortical hemodynamic changes induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in real time </plain></SENT>
