<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of prior exposure to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> on infarction size after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced in the awakening animal to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> type and exposure duration would independently affect the amount of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats (weight, 200 to 300 g) were anesthetized briefly with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> for placement of hemodynamic instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, rats were treated with either a short (approximately 1 hour) or long (8 hours) duration of inhaled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (1% to 2%) or intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg bolus, 30 mg/kg per hour infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each cohort (n=8 per group) was then subjected to 2-hour MCAO by the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anesthesia was discontinued once MCAO was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured ([(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography) at end-occlusion in short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (n=5) or short-duration <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (n=5) anesthesia groups and in corresponding surgical shams (n=3 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pericranial temperature, PaO(2), PaCO(2), and blood pressure were controlled and not different among groups before or during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCAO resulted in a similar immediate reduction in laser-Doppler flow signal after discontinuation of anesthesia in the awakening animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was smaller in rats exposed to short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> in cortex (87.5+/-16.6 mm(3)) (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and caudoputamen (38.3+/-13.7 mm(3)) compared with rats exposed to short-duration <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (cortex, 177.5+/-16.9 mm(3); caudoputamen, 47.8+/-2.9 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was not different in long-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> versus long-duration <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Absolute cortical or caudoputamen intraischemic CBF was not different between short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or short-duration <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> exposure before MCAO in the awakening animal attenuates infarction volume compared with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This protection by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> is not mediated through preservation of intraischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Longer durations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> exposure may activate secondary injury pathways, which negate the protective effects of short-term <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> preischemic treatment </plain></SENT>
