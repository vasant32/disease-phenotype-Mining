<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the effect of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> dependent K channel opener KRN2391 (N-cyano-N' -(2-nitroxyethyl)-3-pyridinecarboximidamide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25224">methanesulfonate</z:chebi>) (Kirin Brewery Co., Gunma, Japan) on bladder overactivity induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 7 days after implantation of a bladder catheter in male Sprague-Dawley rats a cannula for intracerebroventricular administration was implanted and the left middle cerebral artery was occluded with 4-zero monofilament nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 22 hours after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> saline was infused into the bladder at a constant rate (200 microl. per minute) and a cystometrogram was obtained with the rat in the conscious state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KRN2391 (5 microl.) was administered in intracerebroventricular fashion at graded doses (0.15 to 15 microg.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity in conscious rats was significantly reduced after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of KRN2391 significantly increased bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted but not in sham operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> dependent K channel opener may be useful for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> overactivity after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> via action on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
