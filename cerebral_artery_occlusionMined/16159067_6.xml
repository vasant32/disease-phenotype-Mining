<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study employed delayed, multiple HBO treatments and evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological functional recovery for 4 weeks after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and were subsequently exposed to HBO (2.5 atmospheres absolute [ATA]) for 2 hours per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HBO was administered at either 6 or 24 hours after MCAO/R and was repeated daily for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat behavior was scored to evaluate neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed for histological analysis of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratio at 1 and 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats with HBO delayed for 6 or 24 hours following MCAO/R displayed a significant decrease of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratio and amelioration of neurological deficits compared to the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that delayed, but multiple, HBO treatments can improve neurological evaluation and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
