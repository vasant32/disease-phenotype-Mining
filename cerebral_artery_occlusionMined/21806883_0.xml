<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 54 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group and MCAO+ADSC-treated group (n=18 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A permenant focal cerebal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model was established using modified Longa's method ADSC was labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> before the transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after MCAO, 30 μL of cell suspension containing 1×10(6); cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of MCAO+ADSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 d, 14 d and 28 d after MCAO, the expressions of GFAP, Neuritin and NF-200 were detected in ischemic region by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> staining positive cells were observed around the cerebral infarcted area in the ADSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Neuritin, NF200 were higher, but GFAP was lower than that of the MCAO group at 7 d, 14 d and 28 d (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC can induce regeneration and repairment of impaired neuronal axons in rat brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, partly by inhibiting the expression of GFAP and enhancing the expressions of Neuritin, NF-200 in the brain </plain></SENT>
