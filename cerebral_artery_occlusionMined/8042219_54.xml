<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The integrity of the blood-brain barrier may play an important pathophysiological role during postischemic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the factors that lead to exacerbation of brain injury by reperfusion, we investigated changes in cerebral blood flow, blood-brain barrier permeability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and infarction in permanent or temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats and studied the relation between local cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed with the rat suture model, allowing either permanent (6 hours) or temporary occlusion (3 hours of occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured brain water, ion contents, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and determined cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry and blood-brain barrier permeability with [3H] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During occlusion, cerebral blood flow was reduced to 7% to 15% (permanent) and 10% to 17% (temporary) of the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 3 hours of reperfusion, it returned to 47% to 80% (lateral cortex) and 78% to 98% (medial cortex) of the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the contralateral hemisphere, the water content in the ischemic area increased in both permanent and temporary groups (P &lt; .05, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and blood-brain barrier disruption were greater in the reperfusion group compared with the permanent occlusion group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption correlated with cerebral blood flow during reperfusion (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and blood-brain barrier disruption are exacerbated after reperfusion in this model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption may relate to the degree of cerebral blood flow recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, although early reperfusion in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may preserve penumbra tissue, late reperfusion may increase the tissue injury </plain></SENT>
