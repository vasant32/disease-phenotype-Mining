<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AHN649, an analog of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4470">dextromethorphan</z:chebi> (DM) and a relatively selective low-affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was evaluated for neuroprotective effects using the rat intraluminal filament model of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated rats, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in neurological deficits and severe infarction measuring 232 +/- 25 mm(3), representing approximately 25% contralateral hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment with AHN649 (0.156-20 mg/kg i.v.) or DM (0.156-10 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 40 to 60% compared with vehicle-control treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AHN649 neuroprotection was linear and dose dependent (ED(50) = 0.80 mg/kg), whereas DM neuroprotection (ED(50) = 1.25 mg/kg) was nonlinear and less effective at the higher doses (2.5-10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although impaired neurological function scores improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups by 24 to 72 h, the most dramatic improvement was associated with AHN649 treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a rat electroencephalographic model of brain function, separate neurotoxicity experiments revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> i.v. doses of DM caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (ED(50) = 19 mg/kg) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (LD(50) = 27 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AHN649 failed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity at doses up to 100 mg/kg (LD(50) = 79 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, AHN649 is described as a potent, efficacious neuroprotective agent devoid of serious central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system neurotoxicity and possessing potential therapeutic value as antistroke treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the feasibility of targeting low-affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>-site ligands as postinjury therapy for ischemic brain injury has been confirmed </plain></SENT>
