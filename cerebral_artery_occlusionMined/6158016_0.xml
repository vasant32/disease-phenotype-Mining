<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the animals with brains neovascularized by transposed omentum showed a mild drop of rCBF accompanied by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns of somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by sciatic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control animals, the evoked cortical electrical activity drastically decreased in amplitude immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and fell to zero one-half hour later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decay of bioelectrical activity in these rabbits was associated inevitably with a major drop in the rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination, as well as the functional data, indicate that omental transposition in animals exposed to experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> minimizes the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> because the neovascularization is capable of maintaining the local blood flow for at least 1 hour; therefore, the cortical electrical activity is preserved totally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the light of these results, the authors suggest that this surgical technique can also be utilized in human beings who are affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> to prevent more serious consequences </plain></SENT>
