<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of quantitative methods for assessment of white matter pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has precluded in vivo evaluation of therapeutic interventions directed at axons and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrate here that the quantitative extent of white matter pathology was reduced by restoration of cerebral blood flow after 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in anesthetized rats by intraluminal thread placement, either transiently (for 2 hours) or permanently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, axonal damage was determined by amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry, and the ischemic insult to oligodendrocytes was assessed by Tau-1 immunostaining in the same sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adjacent sections, ischemic damage to neuronal perikarya was defined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hemispheric extent of axonal damage was reduced by 70% in the transiently occluded animals from that in permanently occluded animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volumes of oligodendrocyte pathology and of neuronal perikaryal damage were reduced by 62% and 58%, respectively, in the transiently occluded animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that this methodologic approach for assessing ischemic damage in axons and oligodendrocytes can detect relative alterations in gray and white matter pathology with intervention strategies </plain></SENT>
