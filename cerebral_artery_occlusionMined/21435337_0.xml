<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has been reportedly alleviated by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyCAP) was proposed to be an endogenous equivalent of CsA; CsA- and CyCAP-targeting protein cyclophilin C have attracted extensive attention regarding their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-alleviating mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have introduced the specific CyCAP antibody for evaluating its distribution in the rat ischemic brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, CyCAP was highly expressed in the activated microglia/macrophages in the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown what roles CyCAP plays in the activation of macrophage phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we studied CyCAP function using a RAW264.7 macrophage cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we expressed CyCAP-GFP and cyclophilin C-FLAG in RAW264.7 cells, we found that CyCAP and cyclophilin C make a complex, which is competitively inhibited by CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, in immunoprecipitates by anti-calcineurin antibody, cyclophilin C and CyCAP were detected, and CyCAP pulled down NFATc1, suggesting that both CyCAP and cyclophilin C form a complex with calcineurin and NFATc1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When CyCAP was adenovirally overexpressed in RAW cells, NFAT staining increased over the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, calcineurin and IL-2 were increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, CyCAP appears to control macrophage functions by activating NFAT and the resultant IL-2 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a protein phosphatase inhibitor PhoSTOP, NFAT was localized more to the cytoplasm, and phagocytosis was decreased strikingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that in a CyCAP-cyclophilin C pathway for macrophage activation, calcineurin phosphatase activity is essential for the phagocytosis activity via dephosphorylation of NFATc1 </plain></SENT>
