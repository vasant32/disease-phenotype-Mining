<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group,a sham operation group,a ligustrazine treatment group, and a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ligustrazine treatment group and the control group were further divided into 5 subgroups: 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d, and 21d reperfusion after 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion model was made by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S phase cells were labelled with BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry method was conducted to detect the BrdU positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of BrdU positive cells in the SVZ was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of neuro nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) was detected with Western blot method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant increase of BrdU positive cells in SVZ of ligustrazine treatment in the 1d and 3d group compared with that of the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total number of BrdU positive cells reached a peak in 7d group and declined afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells proliferated also in SVZ on the contralateral side, and peaked at 7d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nNOS expression of ligustrazine administration after the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion decreased at 1d and 3d after the reperfusion compared with that of the control group (P&lt;0.05), and increased at 7d, but with no significant difference compared with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine may promote the cell proliferation in SVZ of adult rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury by decreasing the nNOS expression </plain></SENT>
