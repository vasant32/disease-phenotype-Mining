<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may be due to the lack of long-term functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, delayed administration of the sigma receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to determine whether the protective effects of DTG lead to improvements in behavioral functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to MCAO and administered 7.5, 1.5, or 0.75 mg/kg DTG beginning 24 h post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological outcomes (96 h, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks) were compared with performance on a series of behavioral tests (2 and 4 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade staining and immunohistochemistry were used to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and immune cell recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> doses significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and perturbation of striatal white matter tracts at 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These reductions were associated with decreased numbers of CD11b-positive amoeboid microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite short-term efficacy, DTG failed to improve behavioral outcomes or reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes after 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While DTG may prove beneficial as a short-term therapy, these data highlight the importance of long-term functional recovery when evaluating novel therapies to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
