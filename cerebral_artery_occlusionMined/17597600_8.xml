<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that this phenomenon may be detrimental and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with a combined non-hypotensive dose of the angiotensin AT(1) receptor inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> and the endothelin ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ZD1611 reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in male Wistar rats by the intraluminal filament technique for 2 h followed by recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals received systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (0.05 mg/kg/day), ZD1611 (0.15 mg/kg/day), both combined or vehicle with start immediately after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 48 h the rats were sacrificed, the brains sliced and stained with 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) and the volume of ischemic damage determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral arteries were harvested for immunocytochemical studies of angiotensin AT(1) and endothelin ET(A) receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">Candesartan</z:chebi> or ZD1611 did alone not significantly decrease the brain damage or improve neurological scores as compared to vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined inhibition of angiotensin AT(1) and endothelin ET(A) receptors however decreased the brain damage and improved the neurological scores (both P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment did not change resting mean arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an upregulation of angiotensin AT(1) receptors in the ischemic middle cerebral artery smooth muscle cells, which was normalised by the combined treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study shows that combined inhibition of angiotensin AT(1) and endothelin ET(A) receptors reduces the brain damage and improves the neurological outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rat </plain></SENT>
