<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In group I (n = 7) occlusion was maintained for 3 h, with immediate sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In group II (n = 7) occlusion was maintained for 5 h, with immediate sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group III (n = 7) occlusion was maintained for 3 h, followed by a 2-h period of reperfusion prior to sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of injury was significantly larger (P less than 0.05) in the 5-h occlusion group [15 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD)] compared to the 3-h occlusion group (9 +/- 2%); indicating a time-dependent worsening of the histochemical detection of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the area of injury was significantly less in the reperfusion group (5 +/- 2%) compared to the group that was evaluated after 3 h of occlusion without reperfusion (9 +/- 2%); indicating that some component of the injury revealed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> is potentially reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that contrary to previous understanding, the histochemical abnormality revealed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> is reversible in some circumstances and does not necessarily represent inevitable infarction </plain></SENT>
