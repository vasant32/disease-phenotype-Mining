<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the time course of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> modifications, we performed angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, T1-weighted (T1 W) imaging and T1 mapping, and monitored <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and recanalization in rats (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were grouped according to the duration of occlusion: 30 min (group A, n = 8), 1 h 30 min (group B, n = 9), and 2 h 30 min (group C, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 17 animals (four in group A, six in group B, and seven in group C), MnCl2 and dimeglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA) were injected at 13 min and 34 min after recanalization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 10 remaining animals (control groups) underwent the same acquisition protocols, but no contrast agents were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell damage was determined 1 h after recanalization on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in the rat, changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability assessed by contrast agent extravasation occur within the first hour of reperfusion, even after an occlusion period not exceeding 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability to Gd-DOTA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29035">Mn2+</z:chebi> were detected in our experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in apparent diffusion coefficient during occlusion appears to be a good predictor of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> modifications after reperfusion in this model </plain></SENT>
