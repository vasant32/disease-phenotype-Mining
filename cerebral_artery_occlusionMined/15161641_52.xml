<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in ischemic or metabolic insults, the function of astrocytic gap junctions composed mainly from connexin43 (Cx43) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that heterozygous Cx43 null mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> exhibited significantly enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used mice in which the human GFAP promoter-driven cre transgene deletes the floxed Cx43 gene in astrocytes, excluding the effects from reduced Cx43 expression in many other cell types as well as astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We induced focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in mice lacking Cx43 in astrocytes [Cre(+)] and control littermates [Cre(-)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cre(+) mice showed a significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, detected by terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling and caspase-3 immunostaining, compared to Cre(-) mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that astrocytic gap junctions could be important for the regulation of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that astrocytes play a critical role in neuroprotection during ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
