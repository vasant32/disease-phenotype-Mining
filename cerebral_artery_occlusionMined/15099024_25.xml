<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the expression, activation, and cellular location of MMP-3 and the cleavage of agrin, an MMP-3 substrate, following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 was activated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, which was revealed by the appearance of a cleaved form and increased degradation of a substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMP-3 was observed in ischemic neurons, oligodendrocytes, microvasculature, and reactive microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cell cultures, MMP-3 expression was observed in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in mature oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendrocyte progenitors, astrocytes, or microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Casein zymography revealed MMP-3 in cultured neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agrin was expressed in cultured neurons and cultured astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In brain tissue, agrin was detected in neurons, and following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> it was also detected in reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of MMP-3 to protein extracts from control brain caused neuronal agrin degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, agrin disappeared from the tissue membrane fraction and a cleaved agrin fragment was found in tissue protein extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results show MMP-3 activation and neuronal transmembrane agrin cleavage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the finding that MMP-3 cleaves brain agrin strongly suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced MMP-3 activation causes agrin cleavage </plain></SENT>
