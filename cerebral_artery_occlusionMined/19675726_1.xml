<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical cord blood as a source of stem cells has recently been reported in experimental treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the nature of cells and cellular mechanisms leading to neurofunctional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the potential of separated CD34(+) versus CD34(-) human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) to promote functional recovery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, known for a risk profile comparable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After three weeks of behavioral training in the RotaRod and Beamwalk test arrays, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For cell therapy, 1 x 10(6) cryopreserved cells were administered systemically between 8 and 10 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The behavioral tests were performed together with a neurological severity score (mNSS) until day 29 to assess neurofunctional disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly complete functional remission was observed with both subpopulations CD34(+) as well as CD34(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To localize cells histologically, they were labeled with a fluorescence dye (CFSE) before injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Again, after administration of CD34(+) as well as CD34(-) cells, CFSE labelled cells were found that accumulated in the border zone between the central <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the ischemic lesion and functional brain tissue, thus indicating active attraction towards the lesion for both cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistology with anti-CD68 and antibodies to human neuronal markers (NF-L, chromogranin) indicated an accumulation of human and rat monocytes in the border zone of the lesion while neuronal cells of human origin could not be detected in host brains </plain></SENT>
