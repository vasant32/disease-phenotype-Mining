<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed intracranial transplantation of multipotential neuro-epithelial stem cells with mesenchyme into experimentally large ischemic lesions to study their potential to relieve deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 minutes, producing an extensive ischemic lesion in the ipsilateral striatum and adjacent cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rat mesencephalic neural plate at the early somite stage (embryonic day 10.5) together with adjacent ventral mesenchyme was used as donor material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed histological and immunohistochemical studies, with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 3': 5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP-32; a striatal marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Micro-angiograms were made by using Microfil <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water-maze</z:mp> learning and treadmill task were employed to evaluate motor and cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: A viable non-tumoral mass was recognized in the rat striatum, up to as long as 156 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were many cells positive for tyrosine hydroxylase or DARPP-32 in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of the DARPP-32 positive cells within the graft had extended their dendrites into host tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the micro-angiograms, many fine vessels were observed within the graft and dilated vessels meandered around the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transplanted animals recovered significantly better in motor and cognitive functions than animals injected with only culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Neuro-epithelial stem cells may follow several lines of differentiation; along the naturally genetically programmed line of differentiation, or along other cell lines depending on different environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Grafting of neuro-epithelial stem cells with mesenchyme may merit a further study as a treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
