<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical significance of sulcal effacement has been widely investigated in CT studies, but the results are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the presence of perisylvian sulcal effacement (PSE) on fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI and hypothesized that PSE may be related to collateral flow status together with hyperintense vessels on fluid attenuation inversion recovery in hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated whether an association between PSE and clinical outcome could be found in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and underwent MRI including FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of PSE and hyperintense vessels on fluid attenuation inversion recovery and the collateral status and occurrence of early recanalization (ER) on conventional angiography were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 139 patients, 79 (56.8%) had PSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate testing revealed PSE was independently associated with collateral status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between hyperintense vessels and collaterals was different depending on PSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to PSE-positive and ER-negative patients, PSE-negative and ER-negative patients (odds ratio, 4.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-15.17) and PSE-negative and ER-positive patients (odds ratio, 34.62; 95% confidence interval, 5.75-208.60), but not PSE-positive and ER-positive patients, were more likely to experience favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¤ 2 at 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PSE is independently associated with collateral status in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PSE in conjunction with recanalization status can predict clinical outcomes in these patients </plain></SENT>
