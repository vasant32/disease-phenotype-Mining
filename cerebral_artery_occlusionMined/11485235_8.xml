<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA) levels in rabbit brains following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were randomly and blindly assigned into four groups of eight animals each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control groups received 2% carboxymethylcellulose solution, while 10% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> 150 mg/kg was given to the treatment group 1 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each group was subdivided into two groups which were sacrificed 4 h or 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> values of the rabbits in the control groups were quite high at both times and highest after 24 h, particularly in the centre of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in UA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> values was observed in rabbits that were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to our results, it was concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> pretreatment protects neural tissue in the early period after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and prevents cerebral injury in the late period, especially in the perifocal area, possibly by preventing the formation of free radicals with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase inhibition </plain></SENT>
