<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat model was successfully established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and model rats were given nasal TMPP pH-sensitive in situ gel (10 mg x kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusates of brain striatum area were collected at each time point by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of TMPP was determined by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated by Kinetica 4.4 software at each time point of the brain drug concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main pharmacokinetics parameters of TMPP were fitted with compartments 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After nasal TMPP pH-sensitive in situ gel the values of C(max) and AUC of both components in brain showed as follows: the value of model group &gt; that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant difference can be observed in the process of brain pharmacokinetics in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and model rats after giving nasal TMPP pH-sensitive in situ gel </plain></SENT>
