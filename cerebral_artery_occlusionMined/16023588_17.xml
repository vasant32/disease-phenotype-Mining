<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that neuregulin-1 blocked delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce profound changes in gene expression and contribute to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory and stress mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of focal ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether neuregulin-1 can influence inflammatory and stress gene expression in the rat brain following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared gene expression profiles in animals treated with neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1) or vehicle followed by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used the Affymetrix GeneChip system to analyze gene expression in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several inflammatory and stress genes were significantly induced following MCAO compared to sham controls including heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), interleukin-1beta, and macrophage chemotattractant protein-1 (JE/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NRG-1 attenuated the expression of many of these genes by 50% or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that NRG-1 suppressed inflammatory gene expression in activated macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NRG-1 also prevented neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell line, suggesting that NRG-1 may have both direct and indirect neuroprotective capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that NRG-1 can regulate inflammatory and stress gene expression and may give new insight to the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective role of neuregulins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
