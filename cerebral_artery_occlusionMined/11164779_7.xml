<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The infarction and brain water content were evaluated at 48 h and 24 h after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single bolus injection of NS-7 (0.03125-0.25 mg/kg) immediately after MCAO produced a dose-dependent reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> both in the cerebral cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, NS-7 did not change the water content in non-occluded brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, NS-7 significantly reversed the decrease in tissue ATP content observed at 3 h but not at 0.5 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker NS-7 protects cerebral tissues against ischemic insults by improving the disturbance of cerebral energy metabolism and suppressing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
