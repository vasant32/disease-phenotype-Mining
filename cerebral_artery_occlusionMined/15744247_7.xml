<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We (1) tested the neuroprotective potential of DMSO at different time windows on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and (2) investigated the effects of DMSO on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> evolution using quantitative diffusion and perfusion imaging in a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, DMSO treatment (1.5 g/kg intravenously over 3 h) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 24 h after MCAO by 65% (P&lt;0.00001) when initiated 20 h before MCAO, by 44% (P=0.0006) when initiated 1 h after MCAO, and by 17% (P=0.11) when started 2 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction was also observed after a 3-day survival in animals treated 1 h after MCAO (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, treatment was initiated 1 h after MCAO and maps for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were acquired before treatment and then every 30 mins up to 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow characteristics and CBF-derived lesion volumes did not differ between treated and untreated animals, whereas the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-derived lesion volume essentially stopped progressing during DMSO treatment, resulting in a persistent diffusion/perfusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was mainly observed in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that DMSO represents an interesting candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
