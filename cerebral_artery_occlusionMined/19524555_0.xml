<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that treatment with dl-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) increases the number of local potent cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to test whether NBP enhances post-ischemic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induced factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were used to create middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NBP was given 80 mg/kg per d for 10 consecutive days, starting 12, 24, 48 and 72 h respectively after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was assessed daily and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as the expressions of CD31, VEGF, HIF-1 alpha and bFGF was detected 13 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administration of NBP starting within 24 h after MCAO enhanced recovery of neurobehavioral function, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, increased the quantity of CD31 positive vessels, and up-regulated expressions of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that treatment with NBP within 24 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> rescues brain tissue by enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> associated with up-regulation of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha expressions </plain></SENT>
