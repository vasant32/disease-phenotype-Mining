<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In normoglycemic animals this damage usually consists of selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (SNN), and is largely confined to the lateral caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In hyperglycemic subjects damage occurs more rapidly, involves also neocortical areas, and is often of the pan-necrotic type ('infarction') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since experiments on forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of 30 min duration suggest that microcirculatory compromise develops during recirculation, we studied whether focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the same duration, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2 or 4 h, leads to microcirculatory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this possibility, we fixed the tissue by perfusion and counted the number of formed elements (leukocytes, macrophages and erythrocytes) in capillaries and postcapillary venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, capillary patency was evaluated following in vivo injection of Evan's blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of tissue fixed by perfusion after 1, 2 and 4 h of recirculation showed an increasing density of SNN in the caudoputamen of normoglycemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperglycemic, but not normoglycemic, animals showed pan-necrotic lesions ('infarction') after 4 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, the total volume of tissue damage (SNN plus infarction) was larger in hyper- than in normoglycemic animals at 2 and 4 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, hyperglycemic animals showed involvement of neocortex which increased with the time of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic hemisphere, between 5 and 10% of counted capillaries contained formed elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, since hyperglycemic animals contained an equal (or smaller) amount of cells the results did not suggest that capillary 'plugging' could explain the aggravated damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both normo- and hyperglycemic animals showed close to 100% capillary patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results thus fail to support the notion that the aggravation of focal ischemic damage by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is due to obstruction of microvessel by swelling or leukocyte adherence </plain></SENT>
