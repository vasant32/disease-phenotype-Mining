<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative and objective method for evaluating neurological deficits in mice with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the neurological deficits were evaluated 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the mean angles, dominant angles and turns in a hanged test in which the mice were sticked on the wall, and the holding angles in an inclined plane test as well, Then we determined the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, neuron density in hippocampus, cortex and subcortical areas 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neuron density and neurological deficits were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared the quantitative method with two typical complex methods of behavioral assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of [pranlukast, 4-oxo-8-[p-(4-phenylbutyloxy) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50520">benzoylamino</z:chebi>]-2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22727">benzopyran</z:chebi> hemihydrate] (ONO-1078), a neuroprotective agent, on ischemic injury was observed using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the variables measured by both quantitative and typical behavioral methods significantly changed in the ischemic mice, and correlated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neuron densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitative variables well correlated with those of typical behavioral assessment, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ONO-1078 inhibited ischemic injury and reduced the total scores of quantitative assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the quantitative method we developed is useful in evaluating neurological deficits of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with the advantages of objectivity, quantification, simplicity and non-invasion, and can be used in the evaluation of neuroprotective effects of drugs </plain></SENT>
