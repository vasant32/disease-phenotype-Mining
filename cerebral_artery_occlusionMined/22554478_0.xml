<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate the potential improvement in prediction accuracy when incorporating MRI diffusion data from multiple time points during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase to improve prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out using MRI data from rats subjected to permanent, 60-min and 30-min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of prediction accuracy were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO group, prediction with multiple time-point diffusion data improved sensitivity and specificity compared with prediction using a single time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 60-min MCAO group, multiple time-point analysis improved specificity but decreased sensitivity compared to the single time-point analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 30-min MCAO group, multiple time-point analysis showed no statistically significant improvement in specificity and sensitivity compared with the single time point analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is because reperfusion transiently or permanently reversed the decline in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values, resulting in increased uncertainty and thus decreased prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incorporating this a priori information could further improve prediction accuracy in the reperfusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that incorporating MRI data from multiple time points could improve prediction accuracy under certain ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
