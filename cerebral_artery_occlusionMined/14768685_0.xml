<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results were found with both drug- and electrically-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pO2 increased to a greater degree in brain tissue rendered ischemic by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transient reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone failed to produce significant pO2 changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since oxidative metabolism has been shown by other investigators to proceed at an elevated rate during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity, the increased pO2 must reflect improved collateral circulation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
