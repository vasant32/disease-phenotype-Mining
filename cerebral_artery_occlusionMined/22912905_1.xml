<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At days 60-63 post-MCAo, significant recovery of motor and cognitive function was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals transplanted with AFS cells compared to vehicle-infused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher number of double-labeled Ki67/MAP2-positive cells and a similar trend towards increased Ki67/MAP2 double-labeling were observed in the DG and SVZ of AFS cell-transplanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals, respectively, compared to vehicle-infused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
