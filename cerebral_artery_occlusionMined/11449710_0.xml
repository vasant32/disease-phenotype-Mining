<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) has been gaining wide acceptance as a clinically useful tool in the field of neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The great diagnostic value of 3D-CTA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other cerebrovascular diseases</z:e> has been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, images of the intracranial and cervical arteries have not been obtained simultaneously because of the limitation of the scanning area and the need for contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to use 3D-CTA to screen for cerebrovascular disease, we used a helical CT scan with an intravenous single bolus injection of contrast material to perform 3D-CTA of the intracranial and cervical arteries simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A spiral computed tomographic scan was performed with a Hispeed Advantage RP (General Electric) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After injection of 150 ml of nonionized contrast material at a rate of 3 mm/sec in an antecubital vein, an axial computed tomographic scan (120 kV, 200 mA) of the cranial region was performed with a delay of 20-25 seconds after starting the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Section thickness was 1 mm with table increments of 1 mm per rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scan volume included 20-30 mm above and below the sella turcica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An axial computed tomographic scan (120 kV, 190 mA) of the cervical region was performed with a delay of 30 seconds after completion of cranial CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Section thickness was 3 mm with table increments of 3 mm per rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Image reconstruction was carried out through surface rendering and maximum intensity projection processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From November 1995 to August 1998, we used this technique to screen 218 consecutive outpatients for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were found in 20 cases (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic diseases of the cervical carotid artery were found in 58 cases (26.6%), as follows: carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 2 cases, carotid bifurcation stenosis in 22 cases, and intramural calcification of the internal carotid artery in 50 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic diseases of the intracranial artery were found in 99 cases (45.4%), as follows: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 2 cases, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 21 cases, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 2 cases, and calcification of the carotid siphon in 78 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although our method has various technical problems that require further improvement, we conclude that it is a useful and noninvasive diagnostic modality for screening patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other cerebrovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
