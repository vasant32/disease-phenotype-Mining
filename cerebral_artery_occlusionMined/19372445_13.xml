<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous study demonstrated that pretreatment with electroacupuncture (EA) induces rapid tolerance to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to investigate the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the early neuroprotection conferred by EA pretreatment in the animal model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hours after the end of EA pretreatment, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 minutes in male Sprague-Dawley rats or male C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated at 24 hours or 7 days after reperfusion in the presence or absence of AM251 (a selective cannabinoid receptor type 1 [CB1] receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) or CB1 short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CB1 receptor and the content of endocannabinoids in the brains were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EA pretreatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, improved neurological outcome, and inhibited neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at 24 hours or 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects were abolished by AM251 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CB1 knockdown by CB1 short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> attenuated EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EA pretreatment upregulated the neuronal expression of CB1 receptor in the rat brains and elevated the brain tissue content of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol and N-arach-idonoylethanolamine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 2-arachidonylglycerol and N-arach-idonoylethanolamine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pretreatment with EA increases the production of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol and N-arach-idonoylethanolamine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi>, which elicits protective effects against transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through CB1 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a novel mechanism of EA pretreatment-induced rapid tolerance to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
