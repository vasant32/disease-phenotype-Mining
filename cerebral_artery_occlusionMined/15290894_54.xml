<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the expression of the P2X7 receptor-subtype in the brain cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats was investigated using a permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry with antibodies raised against the intracellular C-terminus of the P2X7 receptor showed a time-dependent upregulation of labeled cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region after right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence visualized with confooal laser scanning microscopy indicated the localization of the P2X7 receptor after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on microglial cells (after 1 and 4 days), on tubulin betaIII-labeled neurons (after 4 and 7 days), and on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes (after 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the following experiments, changes occurring 4 days after MCAO were investigated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of the cortical tissue around the area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> indicated an increase in the P2X7 receptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the receptor localization on synapses (presynaptically), on dendrites, as well as on the nuclear membrane of neurons (postsynaptically) and glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling in combination with P2X7 receptor immunocytochemistry indicated a co-expression on the apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active caspase 3 was especially observed on GFAP-positive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present data demonstrate a postischemic, time-dependent upregulation of the P2X7 receptor-subtype on neurons and glial cells and suggest a role for this receptor in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
