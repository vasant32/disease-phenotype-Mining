<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion produces a sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow or whether collateral vessels restore blood flow to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured blood flow through cerebral collateral vessels to the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and to homologous tissue of the other hemisphere in WKY 1 month after occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow, measured with microspheres, was restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels under control conditions in the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During vasodilatation produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, blood flow and vascular conductance were increased to similar levels in tissue distal to the site of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and in the homologous tissue of the other hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion did not produce infarction in any of the WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 1 month after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in SHRSP, a large atrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was invariably present in the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of collateral vessels to the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> do not differ in SHRSP and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internal diameter and orientation of the anastomotic vessels differ in SHRSP and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, after 1 month of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, changes in the collateral vessels supplying the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in WKY were sufficient to restore blood flow to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> under control conditions and to virtually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels during vasodilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
