<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that PACAP could cross the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) by a saturable transport system, and a systemic administration of PACAP reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> induced by unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied whether this transport system is affected by MCAO in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entry of PACAP38 into the brain was compared in five groups: control, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[(125)I]PACAP38 was injected intravenously and serum and various brain regions were collected 3 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of entry into the brain of PACAP38 was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that PACAP entered the rat brain via a rapid transport system when the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> is intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After transient (2 h) unilateral MCAO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain, showed a selective increase in the passage of PACAP38 across the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after 4 h after the occlusion, which was not related to any generalized change in the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, as measured with albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in the amount of PACAP38 entering the brain was observed in the 6- and 24-h groups, but it returned to the baseline level in the 48-h group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can selectively modify the passage of PACAP38 across the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, in both damaged and undamaged sides of the brain, and that these changes in influx are not solely due to the disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings imply the necessity of adjusting the dose of intravenously administered PACAP38 in order to maximize its therapeutic effect on the brain damage resulting from focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
