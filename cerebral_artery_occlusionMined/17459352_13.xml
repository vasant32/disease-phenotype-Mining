<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed the potential benefit of G-CSF administration after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats received vehicle or G-CSF (50 microg/kg) subcutaneously after reperfusion, and were treated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg) once daily by the intraperitoneal route for 3 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nissl-stained sections at 7 days after tMCAO showed significant reduction of the infarction area (31%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 days after tMCAO, BrdU plus NeuN double-positive cells increased by 43.3% in the G-CSF-treated group (P&lt;0.05), and BrdU-positive endothelial cells were increased 2.29 times in the G-CSF-treated group, to a level as high as that in the vehicle-treated group (P&lt;0.01), in the periischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that G-CSF caused potentiation of neuroprotection and neurogenesis and is expected to have practical therapeutic potential in treating individuals after ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
