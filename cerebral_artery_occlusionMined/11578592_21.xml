<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the spatial and temporal expressions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding neuropilin (Npn)-1, Npn-2 and semaphorin3A (Sema3A) in the rat brain after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MAC) distal to the striate branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of Npn-1 mRNA was transiently upregulated in layers V and VI of the parietal cortex not entering infarction on the lesion side from 3 to 6 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transient up-regulation of Npn-1 mRNA expression was presumably accompanied by an increase in Npn-1 protein as shown by immunohistochemistry in combination with in situ hybridization histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intense Npn-2 mRNA expression was noted temporarily in layer II of the parietal cortex on the lesion side from 1 to 6 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of Sema3A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated in layer VI of the non-infarcted parietal cortex on the lesion side at 6 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were no longer observed at 12 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Npn-1, -2 and Sema3A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were not detected in the ventroposterior thalamic nucleus undergoing secondary degeneration after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion or ischemic core, neuronal expressions of Npn-1, -2 and Sema3A disappeared by 3 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion as the neurons in situ entered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ED-1-positive microglia/macrophages with Npn-1 and Npn-2 mRNA were observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion at 1 week after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the temporal up-regulation of Npn-1 and Sema 3A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in the non-infarcted parietal cortex on the lesion side is insufficient to induce neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> possibly because the up-regulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> molecules are not fully translated and that the overexpression of Npn-1 and/or Npn-2 in the ischemic core with degenerating neurons enables activated microglial cells to contact the damaged neurons in situ for phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
