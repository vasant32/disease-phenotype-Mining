<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined c-fos protein expression in the brain and spinal cord of rats following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) above the rhinal fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after right-sided <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) was detected in neurons not only in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex but also in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter, Fos-LI was localized in the nucleus and perikarya of neurons in the grey matter, notably the large motor neurons in the ventral horn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fos-LI was most intense at 2-4 h, but became undetectable after 48 h in the cerebral cortex and 72 h in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated animals, Fos-LI was almost undetectable or virtually absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also not detected in the core territory supplied by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at any time points after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced neuronal damage in both the cerebral cortex and spinal cord was evaluated by Nissl staining, some neurons appeared atrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the induction of Fos-LI in neurons of the cerebral cortex and spinal cord is linked respectively to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-short stimulation and persistent excitatory or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> phenomenon as a result of focal ischaemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
