<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> could be induced by ischemic stress (i.e., post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>) following ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of BDNF on the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 1, the expression levels of BDNF were significantly decreased in the cortex, hypothalamus, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of tyrosine kinase B receptor, a BDNF receptor, decreased in the hypothalamus and liver and increased in the skeletal muscle and pancreas, but remained unchanged in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrahypothalamic administration of BDNF (50 ng/mouse) suppressed the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> on day 1 and neuronal damage on day 3 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the liver and skeletal muscle, the expression levels of insulin receptors decreased, while gluconeogenic enzyme levels increased on day 1 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes completely recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the presence of BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that regulation of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> by BDNF may suppress ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
