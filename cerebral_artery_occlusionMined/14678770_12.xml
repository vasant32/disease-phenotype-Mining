<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that administration of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) counteracts neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in these studies damage was evaluated at most a few days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have explored the long-term consequences of two routes of GDNF delivery to the rat striatum prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO): striatal transduction with a recombinant lentiviral vector or transduction of the substantia nigra with a recombinant adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector and subsequent anterograde transport of GDNF to striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite high GDNF levels, stereological quantification of striatal neuron numbers revealed no protection at 5 or 8 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, anterograde GDNF delivery exacerbated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, supply of GDNF did not alleviate the striatum-related behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrate that the actions of GDNF after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are more complex than previously believed and that high levels of this factor, which are neuroprotective in models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, can increase ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings also underscore the need for quantitative assessment of long-term neuronal survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> to evaluate the therapeutic potential of factors such as GDNF </plain></SENT>
