<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of reduced blood flow upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> formation and extracellular ion homeostasis under nimodipine preloading were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both open and closed skull primate models were used, with alpha-chloralose anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine infusion increased basal blood flow in the open skull, but not the closed skull animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497247,C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">increased blood pressure</z:e> was little affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses to arterial pCO2 changes and autoregulation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> were severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Residual blood flow after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was significantly higher with nimodipine than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The threshold levels of blood flow for the development of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and for disturbance of ion homeostasis were, however, increased, suggesting that nimodipine interferes with cellular energy metabolism and increases the susceptibility of tissue to ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
