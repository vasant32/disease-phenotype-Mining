<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that DGKzeta may be involved in the selective vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 neurons in transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we aimed to further elucidate functional implications of DGK isozymes in the cerebral cortex suffering from infarction using a focal ischemic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the early phase of 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, DGKzeta-immunoreactivity is reduced rapidly in the nucleus of cortical neurons in the ischemic core, while DGKiota and other neuronal proteins such as MAP-2 and NeuN remain intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that rapid disappearance of DGKzeta in ischemic neurons is a quite early event precedent to <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the late inflammatory phase of infarction DGKzeta-immunoreactivity is detected in non-neuronal cells including factor VIII-positive endothelial cells and ED-1-positive phagocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that DGKzeta may play roles in various processes of ischemic brain damage including neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and non-neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
