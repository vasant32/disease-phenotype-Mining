<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> causes brain injury in millions of people worldwide each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the enormity of the problem, there is currently no approved therapy that can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size or neurological disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the approaches that can be used in limiting the neurological damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the use of prophylactic treatment in patients with a high-risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the Indian herbal plant Withania somnifera as a prophylactic treatment in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two groups of male Wistar rats were pretreated with a hydroalcoholic extract of W. somnifera (1 g/kg, p.o.) for 15 and 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, rats were subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> by occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using an intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 2 h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, reperfusion was allowed by retracting the thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were assessed for ischaemic changes using diffusion-weighted imaging 30 min after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, rats were subjected to motor performance tests and were subsequently killed for the estimation of the marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The control group received vehicle and a similar protocol was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant motor impairment, with elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, was observed in vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, diffusion-weighted imaging showed increased signal intensity in the right hemisphere compared with the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with W. somnifera for 15 days did not improve motor performance or decrease the elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, when the pretreatment time of W. somnifera was increased to 30 days, it prevented motor impairment and significantly decreased the raised levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> compared with vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the W. somnifera (30 days)-pretreated group, the percentage hemispheric lesion area in diffusion-weighted imaging was significantly attenuated (17 +/- 2%) compared with the vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded group (30 +/- 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Because W. somnifera has been documented to have anti-oxidant properties, the protection afforded by W. somnifera could be due to its anti-oxidant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The present study provides first evidence of the effectiveness of an Indian herb in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
