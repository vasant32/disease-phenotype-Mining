<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several hundred small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified and characterized from various organisms, including humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, some of these miRNAs have been found to regulate (patho)physiologic conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>/regression, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present data on the miRNAs expressed under ischemic conditions in both the brain and blood of rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to MCAo were reperfused for either 24 or 48 hours, and both blood and brain samples were harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miRNA expression profiling and oligonucleotide microarray were carried out, and the data were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with published data on protein and gene expression in MCAo rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report here for the first time the involvement of miRNA regulation in brain pathogenesis associated with MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison with the corresponding DNA microarray data revealed that the target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is correlated with the regulation of miRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have also provided evidence that some of the miRNAs that are highly expressed in the ischemic brain can be detected in blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and related pathologies </plain></SENT>
