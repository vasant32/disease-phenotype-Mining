<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perinatal cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarction</z:e> leading to brain cavitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>; the territory of the middle cerebral artery is most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting poroencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> are frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>; that can be managed medically in most cases, only 6-7% of them being refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This particular subset of congenitally hemiplegic children will be possible candidates for electrophysiological investigation and eventually for resective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whatever the kind of surgical treatment, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to optimize functional brain reorganization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL MATERIAL: Twelve children with poroencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were studied and operated on at the Divisions of Child Neurology and Pediatric Neurosurgery, the Catholic University Medical School, Rome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> ranged from mild to moderate; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> was of mild degree in three cases, moderate in four cases and severe in the remaining five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>Behavioral disorders</z:hpo> were observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>; two of them also manifested autistic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children presented with a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome (starting almost invariably during the first year of life); six patients presented with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">West syndrome</z:e> followed by symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e>; the other six presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e>, followed in two cases by continuous spike-waves during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings disclosed focal unilateral interictal epileptiform abnormalities that usually corresponded to the side of the cystic lesion; however, paroxysmal activity often spread synchronously over the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The selection of candidates for surgical treatment was based on neuroimaging and video-EEG monitoring; in particular, we did not use invasive intraoperative neurophysiologic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The convergence of neuroimaging and neurophysiologic findings guided us in performing a limited cortical excision corresponding to the malacic cortex (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> "membrane") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent excision of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful attention was paid not to enter the body of the lateral ventricle to avoid ventriculo-subarachnoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>, eventually responsible for subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> or cerebrospinal fluid leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was one surgery-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, following an otherwise uneventful surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An elevated systemic blood pressure, secondary to repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, can represent a possible concurrent factor for this event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No major complications were recorded among the remaining 11 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> control was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 11 survivors in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two children presented a relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, after an initial improvement, respectively 3 and 4 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These two children underwent subsequently a functional hemispherectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (including the two who underwent functional hemispherectomy) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free (Engel's class Ia), and in one of them <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> therapy has been weaned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the remaining five children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and definitely improved (Engel's class II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>An improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, in particular of cognitive competence, was registered in 8 out of the 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Two of the four severely retarded children, who also presented behavioral abnormalities, did not show any cognitive improvement, whereas some mild improvement of their basal abilities was demonstrated in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the remaining children, even though maintaining a moderate retardation, definitely improved their abilities; in particular, one of them reached an almost borderline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The three patients with unchanged neurodevelopmental delay presented also persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, two children with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> presented neurodevelopmental improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simple surgical excision of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> "membrane" of epileptogenic poroencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> can represent an excellent means to control <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> persistence and late recurrences, although rare, do not allow to exclude that hemispherectomy or partial resections (based on electrocorticography findings) might represent the good answer at least in some cases </plain></SENT>
