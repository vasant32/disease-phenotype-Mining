<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 1% HCl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17790">MeOH</z:chebi> mulberry fruit extract was shown to have a cytoprotective effect on PC12 cells that had been exposed to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extract inhibited the cerebral ischemic damage caused by oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of the mulberry fruit extract was further demonstrated in vivo using a mouse-brain-injury model with a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C3G was isolated as a neuroprotective constituent from the mulberry fruit extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, C3G had neuroprotective effects on the PC12 cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> in vitro and on cerebral ischemic damage in vivo </plain></SENT>
