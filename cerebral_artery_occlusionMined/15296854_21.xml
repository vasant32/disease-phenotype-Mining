<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a new in vivo fluorescence optical imaging protocol to sequentially track the transplanted into the brain of the living animals subjected to cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice BMSC were harvested from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (BMSC-GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after 7 days of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 12 weeks after transplantation, the skull was exposed and the green fluorescence emitted from the brain surface was sequentially observed, using in vivo fluorescence optical microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the results, regional green fluorescence was detected in the ipsilateral parietal region 4-12 weeks after transplantation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals and became more apparent over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The images obtained through the skull were very similar to those acquired by thinning or removing the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed that the transplanted cells migrated towards the ischemic boundary zone and expressed the neuronal or astrocytic marker, supporting the findings on fluorescence optical images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential visualization of the BMSC transplanted into the brain of living animals would be valuable for monitoring the migration, growth and differentiation of the transplanted cells to explore the fate and safety of stem cell transplantation for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
