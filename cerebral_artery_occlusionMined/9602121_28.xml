<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which participates in the upregulation of endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins, during reperfusion after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (TMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC), an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> which inhibits NF-kappaB activation, would alter events in brain reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a rat model of TMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left sides of the brains were rendered ischemic for 2 h, and then the area was allowed to reperfuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated with NAC (150 mg/kg) or saline placebo, sacrificed, and activated NF-kappaB was assessed in both the left and right hemispheres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> at varying intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was also measured in each of the hemispheres collected from a separate group of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated NF-kappaB, consisting of p65 and p50 Rel proteins, was significantly increased 15 min after reperfusion in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activation at 15 min was completely abolished with NAC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NAC treatment 1 h prior to the end of occlusion and at 24 h reduced the percentage infarction volume of the affected hemispheres from 35.5+/-2.8% (S.E.) to 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1+/-2.1% (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NAC treatment at 1 h after the occlusion (after the NF-kappaB peak) and again at 24 h also significantly reduced the percentage infarction volume from 34.8+/-3.8% to 24.6+/-3.8% (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, while NAC inhibited activation of NF-kappaB at 15 min after reperfusion, the drug acted to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by additional, undefined mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results bring into question the various roles of NF-kappaB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
