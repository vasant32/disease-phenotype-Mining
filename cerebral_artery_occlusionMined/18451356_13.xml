<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated that augmented and prolonged activation of astrocytes detrimentally influences both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have suggested that the astrocyte-derived protein S100B may be important in these pathogenic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the causal relationship between S100B and exacerbation of brain damage in vivo remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transgenic mice overexpressing human S100B (Tg huS100B mice), we examined whether S100B plays a cardinal role in aggravation of brain damage after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tg huS100B mice had significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and worse neurological deficits at any time point examined after pMCAO as compared with CD-1 background strain-matched control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes in Tg huS100B mice were significantly increased from 1 to 3 and 5 days after pMCAO (delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion), whereas those in control mice were not significantly altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S100, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and Iba1 burdens in the periinfarct area were significantly increased through to 7 days after pMCAO in Tg huS100B mice, whereas those in control mice reached a plateau at 3 days after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide genetic evidence that overexpression of human S100B acts to exacerbate brain damage and periinfarct reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008918'>microgliosis</z:mp>) during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
