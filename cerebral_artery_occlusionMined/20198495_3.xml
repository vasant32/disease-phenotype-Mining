<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the effects of resection of the nerves bundle from the SPG of rat on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and evaluated the roles of the nitric oxygen synthase (NOS) immunoreactive perivascular nerves of cerebral arteries in MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 7 days after bilateral resections of the nerves bundle from the SPG, the NOS activity perivascular nerves in the middle cerebral arteries disappeared, and the infarction volume and the TUNEL positive cells increased significantly after 24 h MCAO, which implicated that the NOS contained nerves from the SPG maybe have an important role in the MCAO </plain></SENT>
