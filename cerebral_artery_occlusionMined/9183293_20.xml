<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced by a suture insertion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty one rats were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups with either 4 hours of continuous MCAO or 2 hours of MCAO followed by 2 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed at 4 hours after MCAO to quantify the degree of injury in 6 brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were estimated using gradient echo (GE) bolus tracking and steady-state spin echo (SE) imaging techniques, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain injury correlated with the perfusion level measured in both SE CBV and dynamic GE CBF images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the temporary MCAO model, mean lesion size in DWI was 118% larger and hemispheric CBV was reduced by 37% in hyperglycemic compared with normoglycemic rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postischemic MRI-measurable brain cellular injury in proportion to an associated increased microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
