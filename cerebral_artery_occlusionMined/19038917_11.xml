<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is considerable debate regarding the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> to facilitate motor recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or experimental brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different drug dosing and timing schedules and differing physical rehabilitation strategies may contribute to outcome variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to ascertain (1) whether short-term <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> could induce long-term functional motor recovery in rats after an ischemic lesion modeling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans; (2) how different levels of physical rehabilitation interact with <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> to enhance forelimb-related functional outcome; and (3) whether motor improvement was associated with axonal sprouting from intact corticoefferent pathways originating in the contralesional forelimb motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats received vehicle or <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> during the first postoperative week (2 mg/kg, subcutaneously on Postoperative Days 2, 5, and 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both treatment groups, separate cohorts of rats were exposed to different levels of "physical rehabilitation" represented by a control environment, enriched environment, or enriched environment with additional sessions of focused activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skilled forelimb performance was assessed using the forelimb reaching task and ladder rung walk test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anterograde tracing with biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> was used to assess new fiber outgrowth to denervated motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatment groups showed significant motor improvement as compared with control-housed, vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, animals housed in an enriched environment that received <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> paired with focused activity sessions performed significantly better than any other treatment group and was the only group to achieve complete motor recovery (ie, reached preoperative performance) by 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This recovery was associated with axonal sprouting into deafferentated subcortical areas from contralesional projection neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, short-term pairing of <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> with sufficiently focused activity is an effective means of inducing long-term improvement in forelimb motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The anatomic data suggests that corticoefferent plasticity in the form of axonal sprouting contributes to the maintenance of motor recovery </plain></SENT>
