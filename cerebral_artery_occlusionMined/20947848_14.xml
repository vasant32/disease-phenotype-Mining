<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a new approach to the use of a self-expanding stent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were treated with a self-expandable intracranial stent, which was withdrawn in its unfolded state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this technique, we used the Solitaire AB/FR, which is the only intracranial stent that is fully recoverable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had an occlusion of the basilar artery, 12 had a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 2 had terminal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>; 6 of these had to be treated first for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion originating in the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization results were assessed by follow-up angiography immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was evaluated before and after treatment (90-day follow-up) according to the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful revascularization was achieved in 20 of 22 (90.9%) patients (thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> [TICI] 2a/b and 3), a TICI 3 state was accomplished in 12 patients, and partial recanalization or slow distal branch filling with filling of more than two-thirds of the vessel territory was achieved in 8 patients (TICI 2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was immediate flow restoration in 21 of 22 (95.4%) cases after deployment of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stent was removed in its unfolded state in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to recanalization was 277 minutes, with a standard deviation of 118 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score on admission was 19.4, with a standard deviation of 5.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost two-thirds of the patients (63.6%) improved by &gt; 10 points on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale at discharge, and 50% showed a modified Rankin scale score of ≤ 2 at 90 days (59% with a modified Rankin scale ≤ 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 18.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 1 case, an asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was detected on control computed tomography, and 2 patients had a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of an unfolded, fully recoverable, intracranial stent yielded very promising angiographic and clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It combines the advantages of prompt flow restoration and mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
