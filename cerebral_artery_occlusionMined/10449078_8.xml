<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Murine models using intraluminal occluding sutures to establish transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are becoming increasingly widespread, because of advances in transgenic technology and the advent of cerebroprotective strategies to ameliorate postischemic cerebrovascular no-reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the degree of postischemic hypoperfusion is directly related to the severity of the initial ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> of 45-minute duration was produced using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 10-0 (n = 5), 9-0 (n = 5), 8-0 (n = 6), 7-0 (n = 8), 6-0 (n = 30), or 5-0 (n = 5) sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, transient vessel occlusion with 6-0 sutures was performed for 15 (n = 17), 30 (n = 16), or 45 (n = 30) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential laser Doppler measurements of relative cerebral blood flow were obtained, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed using neurological deficit scores and infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although relative cerebral blood flow at the time of occlusion and 24 hours thereafter was diminished in parallel with increasing suture diameters, only the use of larger sutures resulted in postischemic no-reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the suture diameter was increased, the resultant reflow was decreased and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A more than twofold increase in infarction volume (8.0 +/- 3 versus 19.7 +/- 3%, P &lt; 0.05) resulted when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> duration was increased from 30 to 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Titration of the initial ischemic insult leads to corresponding variations in the magnitude of postischemic no-reflow and tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, critical control of the severity of the initial injury in studies using intraluminal suture occlusion is warranted </plain></SENT>
