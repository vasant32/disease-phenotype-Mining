<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We raised the blood pressure of 22 cats by aortic obstruction 5-24 hours after transorbital middle cerebral artery clipping; hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were induced in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure increased by 57.2 +/- 16.9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in the 11 cats with hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and by 40.4 +/- 16.9 mm Hg in the 11 remaining cats with pale brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortical gray matter more in three cats with hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in seven with pale <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that hemorrhagic transformation of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can be induced by a rapid increase in perfusion pressure to brain tissue already exposed to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also suggest that the restoration of blood flow through leptomeningeal collaterals plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic infarction in cases without reopening of occluded arteries </plain></SENT>
