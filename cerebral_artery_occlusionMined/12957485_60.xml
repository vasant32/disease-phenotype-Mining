<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distinction between these cells has not been possible due to a lack of discriminating cellular markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We generated bone marrow chimeric mice by transplanting bone marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice into irradiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages were identified by immunohistochemistry and GFP fluorescence after 1-28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first blood-derived cells infiltrating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area were seen on Day 1 and identified as granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematogenous GFP(+) macrophages were rarely observed on Day 2, reached peak numbers on Day 7, and decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, resident GFP(-) microglial cells rapidly became activated already on Day 1 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even on Days 4 and 7, most macrophage-like cells remained GFP(-), indicating their derivation from resident microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematogenous macrophages were able to acquire a ramified <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> indistinguishable from resident microglia while microglial cells could develop into a phagocytic phenotype indistinguishable from infiltrating macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of macrophages in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area are derived from local microglia, revealing a remarkable predominance of local defense mechanisms over immune cells arriving from the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GFP bone marrow chimeric mice are a powerful tool to further differentiate the function of resident microglia and hematogenous macrophages following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
