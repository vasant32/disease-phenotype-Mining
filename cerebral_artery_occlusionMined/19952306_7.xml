<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) and rtPA on activation of plasminogen system and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ovariectomized female rats were subjected to 1-h transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a suture MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was significantly reduced with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of E2 despite of exogenous administration of rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression and activation of urokinase (uPA), MMP2, and MMP9 were significantly increased in ischemic hemisphere after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exogenous rtPA administration further enhanced expression and activation of uPA, MMP2, and MMP9, which was blocked by E2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further determined the effect of combination therapy of E2 and rtPA in an embolic MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no protection was indicated upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of E2 alone, combination treatment of E2 and rtPA provided protective action at 3 h after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the present study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> could be a candidate for combination therapy with rtPA to attenuate its side effect and hence expand its short therapeutic window for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
