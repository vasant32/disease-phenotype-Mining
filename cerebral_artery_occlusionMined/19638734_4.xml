<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been extensively used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIMT encourages use of the impaired limb along with restraint of the ipsilesional limb in daily life, and may promote behavioral recovery and induce structural changes in brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether CIMT enhances neurogenesis in rat brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that was generated by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were divided into sham group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> treated with CIMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats of CIMT group were treated with a plaster cast to restrain the healthy forelimb for 14 days beginning 1 week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of neuronal cells labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and behavioral recovery were analyzed at day 29 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured the tissue level of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 might be involved in the regulation of neurogenesis following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subventricular zone of the animals treated with CIMT, there was a significant increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells (135 +/- 18, P &lt; 0.05), compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group (87 +/- 12) or sham group (18 +/- 3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in the dentate gyrus, animals treated with CIMT showed a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells (296 +/- 26, P &lt; 0.05) compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group (225 +/- 18) or sham group (162 +/- 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CIMT treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly improved behavioral performances and increased the SDF-1 protein levels in the cortex and dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CIMT treatment enhances neurogenesis and functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
