<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was performed to document the progression of ischemic brain damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat using magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced through permanent tandem occlusion of ipsilateral middle cerebral and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evolution of magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic parameter changes was studied, both short term (1.5 to 8 hours) and long term (24 to 168 hours), in five specific brain regions within the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant changes in proton nuclear magnetic resonance spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times and the "apparent" diffusion coefficient of water could be detected within hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, whereas significant alterations in proton spin-density ratios were not apparent until approximately 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes were evident within 12 hours, with a significant loss of neurons seen in the most severely damaged regions at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging was the most sensitive technique for visualizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The water diffusion coefficient was the only magnetic resonance imaging parameter studied to indicate significant alterations within the first 4 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The degree of change for a particular magnetic resonance imaging parameter appeared to be related to the location and extent of neuronal injury, with the most dramatic changes occurring within the areas displaying the most severe histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that complete specification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions affected by ischemic brain injury may require a combination of imaging strategies applied over a period of days and suggest the possibility of using magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between permanent and reversible cell damage </plain></SENT>
