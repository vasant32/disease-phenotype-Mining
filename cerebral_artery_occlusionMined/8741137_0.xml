<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the known neuroprotective effects of two selective <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 and the AMPA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> NBQX, are reflected in the regional cerebral protein synthesis rates (CPSR) in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with either saline, MK-801 (5 mg/kg i.p.) or NBQX (30 mg/kg i.p. x 3) were subjected to permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional CPSR and volumes of gray matter structures displaying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CPSR were measured in coronal cryosections of the brain by quantitative autoradiography following an i.v. bolus injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> 2 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO completely inhibited protein synthesis in the lateral part of striatum and part of the adjacent frontoparietal cortex corresponding to the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surrounding this, a metabolic penumbra with approximately 50% reductions in CPSR was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MK-801 significantly increased the volume of tissue with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CPSR in the ischemic hemisphere compared to controls, whereas this was not seen with NBQX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that MK-801 and NBQX have different effects on peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> protein synthesis after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since both compounds reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, it is questionable that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inhibition of protein synthesis in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is of significant importance to the final outcome of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
