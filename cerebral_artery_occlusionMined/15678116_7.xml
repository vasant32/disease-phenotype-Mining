<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction of MAG and its neuronal receptors mediates bidirectional signaling between neurons and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The novel finding that an anti-MAG monoclonal antibody not only possesses the ability to neutralise the inhibitory effect of MAG on neurons but also directly protects oligodendrocytes from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of anti-MAG antibody (centrally and systemically) starting 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat significantly reduced lesion volume at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection was associated with a robust improvement in motor function compared with animals receiving control IgG1 </plain></SENT>
