<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The constituents are present as volatile oil, the Curcuma oil (C.oil), semi-solid oleoresins and non-volatile compounds such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rapidly expanding body of data provides evidence of the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi>, and most importantly in the present context, its neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost nothing is known about such activity of C.oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that C.oil (500 mg Kg(-1) i.p.) 15 min before 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) followed by 24 h reflow in rats significantly diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved neurological deficit and counteracted <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent ischemic lesion volume on diffusion-weighted imaging was significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> levels, caspase-3 activities leading to delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were significantly inhibited after treatment with C.oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective activity of C.oil against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities and further; there is attenuation of delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via a caspase-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C.oil appears to be a promising agent not only for the treatment of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but also for the treatment of other disorders associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
