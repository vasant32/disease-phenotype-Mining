<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated upregulated BDNF protein expression by rat embryonic NSCs transfected with the human BDNF gene (BDNF-NSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BDNF-NSCs stimulated neurite outgrowth in cocultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, suggesting that BDNF increased neurogenesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, BDNF promoted recovery of tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphate-buffered saline, untransformed NSCs or BDNF-NSCs were introduced into the penumbra zone of the right striatum of tMCAO rats and neurological function deficit was assessed for up to 12 weeks using the neurological severity score (NSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NSS was significantly lower in the BDNF-NSC transfected transplant group than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other groups from week 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BDNF-NSCs recovered 1 week after transplantation expressed BDNF protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplanted NSCs had differentiated into mature neurons 12 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transgenic NSCs have potential as a therapeutic agent for brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
