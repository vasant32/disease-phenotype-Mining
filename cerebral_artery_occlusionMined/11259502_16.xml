<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi> has several potential mechanisms of action including inhibition of the release of excitatory amino acids (EAA) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The question addressed in this study was whether TAM reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced production of nitrotyrosine, considered as a footprint of the product of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rat brain, 2 h rMCAo produced a time-dependent increase in nitrotyrosine content in the cerebral cortex, as measured by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle, TAM significantly reduced nitrotyrosine levels in the ischemic cortex at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuronal (n)NOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole also tended to reduce nitrotyrosine, but this reduction was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for nitrotyrosine was seen in cortical neurons in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and this immunostaining was reduced by TAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, TAM and the calmodulin inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45951">trifluoperazine</z:chebi> inhibited, with similar EC(50) values, the activity of recombinant nNOS as well as NOS activity in brain homogenates, measured by conversion of [(3)H]arginine to [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was marginal inhibition of recombinant inducible (i)NOS activity up to 100 microM TAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that TAM is an effective inhibitor of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent NOS and the derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> production in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and this may be one mechanism for its neuroprotective effect following rMCAo </plain></SENT>
