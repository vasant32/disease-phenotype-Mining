<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent increase of plasma LIGA20 and its presence in the brain were documented after p.o. drug application </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral treatment with 100 mg/kg of LIGA20 reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the cortex but not in the ischemic core (the striatum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No biochemical or behavioral adverse effects of LIGA20 treatment were observed </plain></SENT>
