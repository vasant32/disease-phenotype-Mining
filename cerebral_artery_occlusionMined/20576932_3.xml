<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses that connect adjacent arterial trees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They lessen ischemic tissue injury by serving as endogenous bypass vessels when the trunk of 1 tree becomes narrowed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number and diameter ("extent") of native (preexisting) collaterals, plus their amount of lumen enlargement (growth/remodeling) in occlusive disease, show remarkably wide variation among inbred mouse strains (eg, C57BL/6 and BALB/c), resulting in large differences in tissue injury in models of occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests similar large differences exist among healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify candidate loci responsible for genetic-dependent collateral variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cerebral collateral number and diameter were determined in 221 C57BL/6xBALB/c F2 progeny, followed by linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for collateral number and diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four QTL were obtained for collateral number, including epistasis between 2 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A QTL that was identical to the strongest QTL for collateral number on chromosome 7 (logarithm of the odds [LOD]=29, effect size=37%) was also mapped for collateral diameter (LOD=17, effect size=30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome substitution strain analysis confirmed this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also obtained a unique QTL on chromosome 11 for collateral remodeling after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Association mapping within the chromosome 7 QTL interval using collateral traits measured for 15 inbred strains delineated 172-kbp (P=0.00002) and 290-kbp (P=0.0004) regions on chromosome 7 containing 2 and 7 candidate genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that collateral extent and remodeling are unique, highly heritable complex traits, with 1 QTL predominantly affecting native collateral number and diameter </plain></SENT>
