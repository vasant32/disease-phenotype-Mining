<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> mediates endothelium-dependent vasodilation, modulates cerebral blood flow, and determines <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> signals in part by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to synthesize cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the role of sGC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury, we compared the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion in mice deficient in the alpha(1) subunit of sGC (sGCalpha(1)(-/-)) with that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure, cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, and vasoreactivity of pressurized carotid arteries were compared in both mouse genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured before and during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then assessed neurological deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 1 hour of occlusion and 23 hours of reperfusion and after 24 hours of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood pressure and cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> were similar between genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that vasodilation of carotid arteries in response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> was diminished in sGCalpha(1)(-/-) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow deficits did not differ between the genotypes during occlusion, but during reperfusion, cerebral blood flow was 45% less in sGCalpha(1)(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological deficits were similar after 24 hours of occlusion in both genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 1 hour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 23 hours of reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 2-fold larger and neurological deficits were worse in sGCalpha(1)(-/-) than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sGCalpha(1) deficiency impairs vascular reactivity to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and is associated with incomplete reperfusion, larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and worse neurological damage, suggesting that cGMP generated by sGCalpha(1)beta(1) is protective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
