<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An investigation was performed to compare the cerebral protective properties of etomidate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats, etomidate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> was administered to achieve and maintain burst-suppression of the electroencephalogram (3-5 bursts/min) for the duration of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fourth group received 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups underwent 3 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and then 2 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the animals were killed and the volume of injured brain was determined by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters did not differ among the four groups during the investigation, with the exception that <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> occurred in the etomidate group (free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, approximately 0.4 g.dl-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of injured brain in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> group (56 +/- 10 mm3) was significantly smaller than that in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> control group (99 +/- 13 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volumes of injured brain in the etomidate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> groups (145 +/- 11 mm3 and 139 +/- 14 mm3, respectively) were significantly larger than those in the control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the apparently detrimental effect of etomidate may be the result of the binding of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> of cerebral endothelial origin by the iron component of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was not recorded, and in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group, there may have been adverse effects on cerebral perfusion pressure associated with vasodilation caused by high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with a protective effect by <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
