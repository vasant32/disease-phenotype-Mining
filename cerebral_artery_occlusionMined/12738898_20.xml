<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After phosphorylation, activated Akt inactivates BAD or caspase-9 or other apoptogenic components, thereby inhibiting cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the relationship between Akt phosphorylation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (FCI) using copper-zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD1) transgenic (Tg) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mice were subjected to 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture blockade followed by 1, 4, and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phospho-Akt expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> was assessed by the hydroethidine method in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and SOD1 Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that phospho-Akt was constitutively expressed and was decreased in the ischemic core as early as 1 hour after reperfusion, whereas it was temporally increased in the cortex at 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phospho-Akt expression was enhanced in the SOD1 Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that phospho-Akt was maximized 4 hours after reperfusion in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, whereas phospho-Akt was increased as early as 1 hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the SOD1 Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in TUNEL-positive cells in the SOD1 Tg mice compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that SOD1 may contribute to the early activation of the Akt cell survival signaling pathway and may attenuate subsequent DNA damage after transient FCI </plain></SENT>
