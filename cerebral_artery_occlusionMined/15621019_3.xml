<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date, characterisation of rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models has concentrated mainly on the investigation of motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present studies was therefore to investigate home cage behaviour (as assessed by a recently developed automatic behavioural classification system, LABORAS) and social behaviour (as a measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>) in rats following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to tMCAO (90 min) showed deficits in general home cage behaviours including locomotion, rearing, <z:mp ids='MP_0001440'>grooming</z:mp> and drinking for up to 7 weeks post occlusion, as compared with sham operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant decrease in the total duration of social interaction was also observed in occluded rats compared with shams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data shows that in addition to motor deficits, animals display changes in home cage behaviour and decreased social behaviour which, in contrast to motor function, are prolonged over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient MCAO in rats may therefore provide a pre-clinical model to investigate agents offering symptomatic relief for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced motor deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> over time following injury </plain></SENT>
