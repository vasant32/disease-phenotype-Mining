<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathways that link these events are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated a close link between the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">Flavonoids</z:chebi> have been suggested to exert human health benefits by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we undertook a pharmacological approach to investigate the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">naringenin</z:chebi>, a potent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi>, to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and NF-κB-mediated inflammatory brain damage in the rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">naringenin</z:chebi> once daily for 21days and then subjected to 1h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 23h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">Naringenin</z:chebi> treatment successfully upregulates the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status, decreases the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and lowers the levels of myeloperoxidase, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and cytokines, besides functional recovery returned close to the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses clearly demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">naringenin</z:chebi> treatment limits glial activation and downregulates the NF-κB expression level and their target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show, prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">naringenin</z:chebi> improved functional outcomes and abrogated the ischemic brain injury by suppressing NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50202">naringenin</z:chebi> may be used as a potential neuroprotectant in patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
