<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only approved drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is intravenously administered functioning as a thrombolytic agent and is used to obtain reperfusion of the affected area of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved in delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and offer multiple opportunities to intervene with neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gelsolin (GSN) is an actin- and calcium-binding protein mediating the disassembly of actin filaments and activity of calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also functions as a regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study tests the hypothesis that increasing the concentration of the form of GSN known as plasma GSN (pGSN) near an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> will provide neuroprotection following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in male rats via intracranial injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, and then treated with local delivery of pGSN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whole brain laser Doppler perfusion imaging was performed through the skull to assess MCAO effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cylinder and vibrissae tests evaluated sensorimotor function before and 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were examined 72 h after MCAO via 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Estimates of relative cerebral perfusion were significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups receiving MCAO with no differences detected between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite equivalent initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the pGSN treatment group was significantly reduced compared with the untreated MCAO rats at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ET-1 induced significant deficits in both cylinder and vibrissae tests while pGSN significantly limited these deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gelsolin could be a promising drug for protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
