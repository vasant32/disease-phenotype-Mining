<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study describes a new technique involving transfemoral selective intraluminal wiring, and evaluates its technical feasibility, effectiveness, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four Wistar rats were used in this work: two for a vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> study and 22 subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 h by our new transfemoral selective "intraluminal wiring" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of reperfusion, the animals were evaluated neurologically, and then were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic, histological (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and TUNEL), and biochemical (DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity) studies were performed to assess the extent of brain damage produced by focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technical success was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signs of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, were detected in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was noticed in any animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfemoral selective intraluminal wiring appears to be a reliable, safe, and minimally invasive technique to induce transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
