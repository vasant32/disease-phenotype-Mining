<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemic white matter lesions, oligodendrocytic degeneration and subsequent proliferation were examined in the mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization histochemistry for proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> was employed as a sensitive and specific marker of oligodendrocytes, and immunohistochemistry for myelin basic protein was used as a compact myelin marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for microtubule-associated protein 2 and albumin was employed to monitor <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and the breakdown of the blood brain barrier, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core of the caudoputamen, the immunoreactivity for microtubule-associated protein 2 disappeared and massive albumin extravasation occurred several hours after vessel occlusion, while proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> signals remained relatively strong at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> signals began to attenuate 12 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and were hardly detectable 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the whole ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ end-labeling of fragmented DNA showed some cells with proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> to have DNA fragmentation at this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> signals, the immunoreactivity for myelin basic protein was detected as long as five days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An apparent increase in the cells possessing strong proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> signals was found five days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mainly in the corpus callosum and the cortex bordering the infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A double simultaneous procedure with in situ hybridization for proteolipid protein <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acid protein or lectin histochemistry for macrophages/microglia showed proliferating oligodendrocytes to be co-localized with reactive astrocytes and macrophages/microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings show that oligodendrocytic damage occurred following ischemic neuronal damage and the breakdown of the blood brain barrier, but preceded the breakdown of myelin proteins in the ischemic lesion, that an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-like process was involved in ischemic oligodendrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and that surviving oligodendrocytes responded and proliferated in the outer border of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
