<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated neoepitope expression in the postischemic brain and the role of natural Abs in recognizing these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and mediating complement-dependent injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel IgM mAb recognizing a subset of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (C2) and a previously characterized anti-annexin IV mAb (B4) were used to reconstitute and characterize injury in Ab-deficient Rag1(-/-) mice after 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reconstitution with C2 or B4 mAb in otherwise protected Rag1(-/-) mice restored injury to that seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) mice, as demonstrated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, and neurologic scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgM deposition was demonstrated in both wt mice and reconstituted Rag1(-/-) mice, and IgM colocalized with the complement activation fragment C3d following B4 mAb reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, recombinant annexin IV significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in wt mice and in Rag1(-/-) mice administered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse serum, demonstrating that a single Ab reactivity is sufficient to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury in the context of an entire natural Ab repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, C2 and B4 mAbs bound to hypoxic, but not normoxic, human endothelial cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the binding of pathogenic natural IgM to postischemic neoepitopes initiates complement-dependent injury following murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, and, based also on previous data investigating IgM reactivity in human serum, there appears to be a similar recognition system in both mouse and man </plain></SENT>
