<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether inter-strain differences exist in the local cerebral blood flow, changes produced by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four male Long-Evans, Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats were subjected to 60 minutes of transient MCAO, carried out with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated 4-0 nylon monofilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was monitored on the parietal cortex with laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in local cerebral blood flow during the first 20 minutes of occlusion was significantly greater in Long-Evans (74.6 +/- 8.9%) than in Sprague-Dawley (50.7 +/- 26.8%) and Wistar (49.0 +/- 21.9%) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strain differences in local cerebral blood flow reduction were maintained, or increased, throughout the occlusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that the intraluminal model of MCAO produces a more pronounced, persistent and stable local cerebral blood flow reduction, with less interanimal variability, in Long-Evans than in Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
