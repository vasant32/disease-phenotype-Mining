<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disturbances may be almost completely prevented by treating animals with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>) inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DFMO has been also shown to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-Methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) toxicity in tissue cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the pathological disturbances in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> metabolism observed following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, particularly the post-ischemic increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, may contribute to the ischemic injury that is most evident in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, effects of DFMO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> system by DFMO decreased ischemic injury volume and brain tissue water content in a dose-dependent manner, without change in vital signs, including systemic arterial blood pressure, arterial partial oxygen pressure, regional cerebral blood flow and body temperature </plain></SENT>
