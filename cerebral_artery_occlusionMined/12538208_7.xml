<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamines</z:chebi> have been implicated in the propagation of ischemic neuronal injury, and previous in vitro studies suggest that sigma ligands modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the potent sigma(1)-receptor ligand 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1-(4-phenylbutyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidine</z:chebi> (PPBP) attenuates the increase of extracellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> in ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under controlled physiological conditions, a microdialysis probe was implanted in right caudoputamen (CP) complex of adult male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a blinded, randomized fashion, rats were divided into five treatment groups: Group 1 (n = 8; saline-saline) continuous i.v. infusion of saline vehicle 30 min before MCAO followed by saline at reperfusion until the end of the experiment; Group 2 (n = 8; PPBP-PPBP) i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PPBP 30 min before MCAO followed by 1 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1) of PPBP; Group 3 (n = 8; saline-PPBP) i.v. saline before MCAO followed by PPBP; Group 4 (n = 4) surgical shams (saline-saline); and Group 5 (n = 4) surgical shams (PPBP-PPBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume at 22 h of reperfusion in the CP complex (percentage of ipsilateral structure) was significantly attenuated in rats treated with PPBP-PPBP (27.3% +/- 9.1%) and saline-PPBP (27.8% +/- 12.7%) compared with saline-saline (59.3% +/- 7.3%) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a three- to fourfold increase in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> concentrations in the microdialysates within 40 min of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> and its metabolites dihydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30745">phenylacetic acid</z:chebi> and homovallinic acid levels were similar among the three groups subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PPBP provides significant ischemic neuroprotection in the CP complex without altering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> accumulation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> in vivo during transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
