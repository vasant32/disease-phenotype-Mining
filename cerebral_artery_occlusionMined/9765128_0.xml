<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We presently examine the relation between histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurologic deficit as endpoints and seek to clarify their sensitivity in defining <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits of 76 cats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were assessed daily and correlated with the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes determined morphometrically after 2 weeks' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A five-item neurologic deficit score included the time elapsed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and forced <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp> resolved (if ever), presence of impaired placing reactions and time elapsed until able to stand and being alert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated the two endpoints' statistical powers to detect group differences using two sets of comparison groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficit score correlated well with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001) and each of the individual deficit score components named above, in turn, correlated with decreasing power with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even so, the number of study subjects required to achieve the same level of statistical significance in assessing group differences was two-fold greater when using the neurologic deficit than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size data: Group sizes of eight and five animals were sufficient for significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size differences while the groups needed be expanded to 15 and 10 animals to similarly achieve significant neurologic score differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size emerges as a more sensitive measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome than does the assessment of neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
