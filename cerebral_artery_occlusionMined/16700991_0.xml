<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty six male young SD rats (5-6 months old) and 36 male aged SD rats (20-21 months old) were randomly divided into young sham operated group, young model group, aged sham operated group and aged model group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two model groups were randomly divided into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 3 hours (I 3 h), I/R 1, 3, 6, 12 days groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 6 rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral I/R model was replicated with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution and the expression of TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA were observed at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of TNF-alpha in the aged sham operated group were higher than that of the young sham operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> dysfunction score (I 3 h and I/R 1-12 d), the water content of cerebral constitution (I/R 1-6 d), the expression of TNF-alpha (I 3 h and I/R 1-6 d), VCAM-1 (I 3 h and I/R 1 d), ICAM-1 (I 3 h and I/R 1-6 d) and ICAM-1 mRNA (I 3 h and I/R 1-12 d) in young model group and aged model group were higher than those of the young sham operated group and the aged sham operated group respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> dysfunction score (I 3 h, I/R 6 d), the expression of TNF-alpha (I/R 1, 3 d), VCAM-1 (I/R 3, 6 d), ICAM-1 (I 3 h, I/R 1 d) and ICAM-1 mRNA (I/R 1-6 d) in aged model group were higher than that of young model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cerebral I/R injury is correlated with the up regulation of TNF-alpha, VCAM-1,ICAM-1 and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cerebral I/R injury of aged rats is more serious than that of young rats which might be associated with up regulation of TNF-alpha, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules expression with aging </plain></SENT>
