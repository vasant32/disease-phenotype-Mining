<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on neurological function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in 33 unanesthetized cats subjected to temporary 6-hour or 24-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) 7 to 10 days after transorbital implantation of a vessel occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HBO therapy (100% oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute) was administered for 40 minutes during or after 6-hour occlusions and before, during, and after 24-hour occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 10 every 30 minutes before, during, and after occlusion and HBO treatments until it stabilized and then daily until the cats were killed 10 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with observations in 13 untreated controls and 6 cats that received 100% O2 at atmospheric pressure during a 6-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HBO therapy during the 1st or 3rd hour of a 6-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in a four-grade improvement of the initial neurological function; this effect persisted during the remainder of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average grade of neurological deficit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 94% less than in the untreated cats (P less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size in the HBO-treated group was 58% less than in controls (P less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size between the untreated cats and those treated with 100% O2 at atmospheric pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HBO therapy during the 4th hour of a 6-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion had no statistically significant effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, even though the mean neurological deficit was 73% less than in controls (P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
