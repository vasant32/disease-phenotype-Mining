<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is applied in many studies on experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rodents to monitor the temporal evolution of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a protocol to evaluate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion (MCAO/R) in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed with a 2.35 T scanner and we focused on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and postcontrast T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show the detailed procedure of volumetry, the contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) and the intraindividual variability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and hemispheric volumes at different reperfusion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presented method is of low variability if image contrast between ischemic and nonischemic tissue is very high, which is the case not only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences at 8 and 12 h of reperfusion but also for DWI after 3 and 5 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we describe the so-called mismatch region of lesion sizes depicted on DWI and postcontrast T1WI that suffers from cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> but lacks contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
