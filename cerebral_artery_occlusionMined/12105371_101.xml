<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated for 3 hours with 1 minimal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> air (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> preconditioning [AP]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) at 0, 12, 24, or 48 hours after AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-pretreated animals were subjected to MCAO 24 hours after AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes was performed 4 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was measured 24 hours after AP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neuronal cultures were exposed to 1.4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> for 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) was performed 24 hours after AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injury was assessed 24 hours later by measuring the release of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase into the medium 24 hours after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">Isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia at 0, 12, and 24 hours before MCAO or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia 24 hours before MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (125+/-42 mm3, P=0.024; 118+/-51 mm3, P=0.008; 120+/-49 mm3, P=0.009; and 121+/-48 mm3, P=0.018, respectively) compared with control volumes (180+/-51 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three hours of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia in rats did not have any effect on local or mean cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization measured 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis from cortical extracts of AP-treated animals revealed an increase of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein beginning 6 hours after AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The iNOS inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg IP) eliminated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-sparing effect of AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In cultured cortical neurons, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> exposure 24 hours before OGD decreased the OGD-induced release of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase by 49% (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> induces prolonged neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo, a process in which iNOS seems to be critically involved </plain></SENT>
