<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many studies have been directed toward describing biochemical, electrophysiological, and cytoarchitectural changes in residual cortex and correlating them with functional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, after neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the thickness of residual tissue can change, the tissue can move, and tissue can fill in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to systematically investigate and document possible gross morphological changes in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue after forelimb motor cortex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats received a unilateral forelimb motor cortex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of equivalent size by pial strip devascularization or photothrombotic occlusion and were then examined using histology or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, or 31 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used as a control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreases in cortical thickness, volume, and neural density were found to extend far beyond the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and included most of the sensorimotor regions of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and intact hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Movement of residual tissue towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was observed and confirmed using anatomical markers placed in intact cortical tissue at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in relation to the idea that extensive time-dependent morphological changes that occur in residual tissue must be considered when evaluating plasticity-related cortical changes associated with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery of function </plain></SENT>
