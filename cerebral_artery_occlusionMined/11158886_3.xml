<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The brain distribution of 9mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) correlates with regional brain perfusion, whereas 99mTc-ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) reflects not only perfusion but also the metabolic status of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT early after recanalization by local intraarterial thrombolysis (LIT) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the predictive value of 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT for the development of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 99mTc-HMPAO and consecutive 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT studies were performed in 15 patients within 3 hours of LIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two SPECT studies were obtained independently using a subtraction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT evaluation was performed using semiquantitative region-of-interest analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noninfarction, infarction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were identified by follow-up CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five lesions were identified (21 noninfarctions, 19 infarctions, and five <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regardless of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT findings, lesions showing isoactivity (count rate densities of 0.9 to 1.1 as compared with the contralateral side) on 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT were salvaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesions with <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> (values &lt; 0.9) on 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT developed irreversible brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> appeared in lesions with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> (values &gt; 1.1) on 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> on 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The brain distribution of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> in a reperfused area identified by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT early after recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is dependent on cerebral tissue viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By combining 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, performed within the first few hours of LIT, it is possible to identify patients at risk for hemorrhagic transformation reliably </plain></SENT>
