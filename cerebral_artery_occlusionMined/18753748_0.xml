<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724">gamma-Hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>), a natural metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> and a drug used in humans to promote slow-wave sleep and treat <z:mp ids='MP_0005279'>narcolepsy</z:mp>, has been suggested to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at high doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess recovery-promoting effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> at a low dose similar to that used in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult mice, subjected to 30 min of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, were intraperitoneally treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, twice/day, 8 h apart) or saline for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor recovery was evaluated by the grip strength test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain lesion was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> and NeuN staining 5 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of neuroplasticity-related genes (GAP43, c-jun, neurocan and ephrin B1) was analyzed by Taqman real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>-treated mice regained their body weight faster and recovered grip strength (3 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) more quickly than saline-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was noteworthy as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> did not influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury, as revealed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> and neuronal staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Taqman PCR assay revealed a decreased expression of c-jun and neurocan in the ischemic striatum of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>-treated mice in comparison to saline-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> at a low dose accelerates neurological recovery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to determine the potential relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>, neuroplasticity, sleep and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
