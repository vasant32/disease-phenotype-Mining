<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its expression and relationship with neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in neonatal rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) have not been clearly elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression and distribution of TNFalpha and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a postnatal Day 10 rat MCAO model using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence double-labeling, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found TNFalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression increased at 2h and was maintained at high levels until 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha protein expression was significantly increased from 4 to 8h (p &lt; 0.01) lasting through 24h (p &lt; 0.05) after reperfusion compared to the sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha immunoreactive cells were colocalized to neurons in both the core and the penumbra areas of the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, apoptotic cells were mainly distributed in the penumbra area and colocalized to neurons as well as to TNFalpha immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that TNFalpha expression increases after neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and is associated with neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
