<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Activation of Notch worsens ischemic brain damage as antisense knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the Notch pathway reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improves the functional outcome in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether Notch activation contributes to postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by directly modulating the microglial innate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The microglial response and the attendant inflammatory reaction were evaluated in Notch1 antisense transgenic (Tg) and in nontransgenic (non-Tg) mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the impact of Notch on microglial effector functions, primary mouse microglia and murine BV-2 microglial cell line were exposed to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> in the presence or absence of GSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence labeling, Western blotting, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed to measure microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB in microglia was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurotoxic potential of microglia was determined in cocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Notch1 antisense mice exhibit significantly lower numbers of activated microglia and reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression in the ipsilateral ischemic cortices compared to non-Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microglial activation also was attenuated in Notch1 antisense cultures and in non-Tg cultures treated with GSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GSI significantly reduced nuclear factor-κB activation and expression of proinflammatory mediators and markedly attenuated the neurotoxic activity of microglia in cocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a role for Notch signaling in modulating the microglia innate response and suggest that inhibition of Notch might represent a complementary therapeutic approach to prevent reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neuroinflammation-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
