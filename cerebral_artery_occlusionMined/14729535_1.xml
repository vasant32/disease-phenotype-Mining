<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyze the implications of prominent <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> laterality at 3D TOF MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3D TOF MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings in 25 patients (12 male, 13 female; mean age, 68.8 years [age range, 29-94 years]) with M1-segment occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observable laterality of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, determined on the basis of 3D TOF MRA findings, was scored according to distal signal extent and compared with findings of collateral flow from the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> via the leptomeningeal anastomosis (LMA) at DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> laterality at 3D TOF MRA in patients and that in 56 healthy control subjects was also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive predictive value of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> laterality for the existence of collateral flow was 99.9% and the negative predictive value 30.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal extent of ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> signal at 3D TOF MRA positively correlated with the grade of collateral flow from the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> via the LMA (r = 0.802; P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> laterality was significantly less common in control subjects (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prominent <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> laterality at 3D TOF MRA in patients with M1-segment occlusion represents the existence of collateral flow from the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> via the LMA </plain></SENT>
