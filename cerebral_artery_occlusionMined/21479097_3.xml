<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further confirm the role played by ASIC1a in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, here we examined the involvement of this channel in two endogenous recently characterized neuroprotective strategies: brain ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to elucidate whether ASIC1a might take part as effector in the neuroprotection evoked by brain ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we investigated the effect of ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning on (1) ASIC1a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in the temporoparietal cortex of rats at different time intervals; and (2) the effect of p-AKT inhibition on ASIC1a expression during ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning were experimentally induced in adult male rats by subjecting them to different protocols of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASIC1a expression was dramatically reduced in both the neuroprotective processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes in ASIC expression were p-AKT mediated, since LY-294002, a specific p-AKT inhibitor, was able to prevent variations in ASIC1a expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study support the idea that the downregulation of ASIC1a expression and activity might be a reasonable strategy to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extension after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
