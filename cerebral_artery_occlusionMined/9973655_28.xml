<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ebselen was conducted in patients with complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ebselen or placebo granules suspended in water (150 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>) were orally administered within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and continued for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major end points were the maximum volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> measured on follow-up computed tomography and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five patients were enrolled in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the intent-to-treat analysis of 99 patients (43 given ebselen and 56 given placebo) did not reach statistical significance in reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>099), the protocol-compatible analysis of 83 patients with complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (34 given ebselen and 49 given placebo) determined a significant reduction using ebselen treatment (p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good outcome was seen in approximately 15% more patients from the ebselen group, but the difference between the 2 groups was not significant (p = 0.129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a corresponding significant reduction in the volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and an improvement in the outcome of patients who started treatment within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest that ebselen protected the brain from ischemic damage in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
