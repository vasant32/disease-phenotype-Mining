<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>2-(1-Hydroxypentyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16150">benzoate</z:chebi> (dl-PHPB), a derivate of 3-n-butylphthalide (dl-NBP), is a novel drug candidate used for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological function, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an animal model of 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats received dl-PHPB (1.3, 3.9, or 12.9 mg/kg) intravenously 10 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the vehicle control group (37.4%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in dl-PHPB-treated groups was reduced significantly and dose-dependently to 25.4, 17.4, and 13.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes in neurological deficient were also observed in neurobehavioral test in a dose-dependent manner, and the neuronal score was improved significantly from the vehicle control of 3.2 to 2.7, 2.1, and 1.8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose, the potency of dl-PHPB was similar to those of dl-NBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF was quantified by using laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the regional CBF values of dl-PHPB groups were significantly higher than that of vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, our study showed that dl-PHPB converted into dl-NBP very quickly in blood in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% of dl-PHPB converted into dl-NBP in 5 min when dl-PHPB was added into plasma at final concentrations of 6, 30, and 60 mug/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result demonstrated that the neuronal protection effects of dl-PHPB were mainly induced by dl-NBP, an active compound converted from its precursor, dl-PHPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, dl-PHPB can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve neurobehavioral deficits in a rat model of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those effects may partially be due to an increase in CBF by the active metabolite (dl-NBP) of dl-PHPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results suggest that dl-PHPB may be useful for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
