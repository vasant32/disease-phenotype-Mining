<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We determined whether the effects of antimuscarinics depend on the suppression of C-fiber bladder afferent nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi> intravenously or intravesically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce C-fiber bladder afferent nerve desensitization resiniferatoxin (RTX) (0.3 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously in female Sprague-Dawley rats 2 days prior to left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, we used rats treated with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and saline vehicle (VEH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insertion of a <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> catheter through the bladder dome and MCAO were performed using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of intravenous (0.2 to 2000 nM/kg) or intravesical (0.2 or 2 nM) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi>, an antimuscarinic agent, on cystometrography were investigated in conscious rats with a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">Tolterodine</z:chebi> was instilled intravesically for 30 minutes and cystometry was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity (BC) was markedly decreased after MCAO in RTX treated (RTX-CI) and VEH treated (VEH-CI) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi> doses (0.2 or 2 nM/kg) significantly increased BC in VEH-CI rats without increasing residual volume but it had no effects on BC in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose (2,000 nM/kg) the drug significantly decreased bladder contraction pressure and increased residual volume in RTX-CI and VEH-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravesical administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi> (0.2 or 2 nM) significantly increased BC in VEH-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi> had no effect on BC in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at low doses <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9622">tolterodine</z:chebi> exerts an inhibitory effect on C-fiber bladder afferent nerves, thereby, improving BC during the storage phase </plain></SENT>
