<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The only available treatment for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, which must be administered within three hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of 1,3-di-o-tolyguanidine (DTG), a high affinity sigma receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, as a potential treatment for decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at delayed time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to permanent embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and allowed to recover before receiving subcutaneous injections of 15 mg/kg of DTG at 24, 48, and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 96 hours the rats were euthanized, and brains harvested and sectioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> areas were quantified at the level of the cortical/striatal and cortical/hippocampal regions in control (MCAO-only) and DTG treated animals using a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, Fluoro-Jade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DTG treatment significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in both cortical/striatal and cortical/hippocampal regions by &gt;80%, relative to control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemical experiments using the neuronal marker, mouse anti-neuronal nuclei monoclonal antibody (NeuN), which showed that application of DTG significantly increased the number of viable neurons in these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DTG blocked the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> evoked by MCAO, as indicated by decreases in the number of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia/macrophages detected by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and binding of isolectin IB4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results demonstrate that the sigma receptor-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, DTG, can enhance neuronal survival when administered 24 hr after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the efficacy of sigma receptors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment at delayed time points is likely the result of combined neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of these receptors </plain></SENT>
