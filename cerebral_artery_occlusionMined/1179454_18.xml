<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> itself varied from very low (8 ml/100 gm per minute) to very high (89 ml/100 gm per minute) values and, averaging the values for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> as a whole, it was impossible to distinguish average flows in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> from those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow values in surrounding zones of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> remained significantly lower than those of comparable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemispheres, and, excluding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the mean average hemispheral blood flow was 35.2 ml/100 gm per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This indicates a significant reduction in flow in the cortex, subsequently shown histologically to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood flow values for the baboon hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation was lost in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and impaired in surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity was grossly reduced in the hemisphere as a whole but was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas, even occasionally in electrode placements within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After perfusion fixation of the head, pathological study of the area of infarction showed a fairly consistent distribution, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> itself consisting of many dilated blood vessels of non-capillary nature scattered among fibrous tissue in what was virtually a glial scar </plain></SENT>
