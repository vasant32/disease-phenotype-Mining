<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model consisting of unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber cylinder attached to a nylon surgical thread inserted through the internal carotid artery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recirculation was accomplished by pulling the thread out of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the reliability of this model and studied the influence of reperfusion of the brain by measuring regional cerebral blood flow in 30 rats and by using conventional neuropathologic methods after different periods of occlusion in 48 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anterior neocortex and the lateral part of the caudate putamen, which were supplied by the occluded middle cerebral artery, were the regions most frequently damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 hour of occlusion in five rats, in the cortex supplied by the occluded artery mean +/- SD blood flow was 0.19 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min (approximately 15% of that in the corresponding region of five sham-operated control rats), and mild scattered ischemic cell change was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three (n = 5) or six (n = 5) hours of occlusion reduced blood flow more severely and caused severe ischemic cell changes in the cortex supplied by the occluded artery in proportion to the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, in five rats subjected to 3 hours of occlusion followed by 3 hours of recirculation, blood flow was restored and spongy edematous change was observed in the cortex supplied by the recirculated artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This change resulted in hypoperfusion of the neighboring cortical region surrounding the recirculated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our model should be useful in various investigations of the influence of reperfusion on focal ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
