<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism underlying this effect is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to investigate whether pre-ischemic treadmill training could serve as a form of ischemic preconditioning in a rat model undergoing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six rats were divided into three groups: a sham control group, a non-exercise with operation group and an exercise with operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treadmill training, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by occluding the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> for 2 h, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half of the rats in each group were sacrificed for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detection of mGluR5 and NR2B 80 min after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals were evaluated for neurological deficits by behavioral scoring and then decapitated to assess the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of mGluR5 and NR2B was detected by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that pre-ischemic treadmill training may induce brain ischemic tolerance by reducing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of mGluR5 and NR2B, and thus, the results indicate that physical exercise might be an effective method to establish ischemic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
