<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the putative anti-inflammatory mechanisms employed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we explored the interactions between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and iNOS knockout (iNOSKO) female mice following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female mice were ovariectomized and treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week later, they were subjected to MCAO, and then killed 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of total, cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes confirmed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> is neuroprotective in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were also significantly smaller in female iNOSKO female mice, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> did not further decrease injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that one mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> may act is by decreasing nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 2 gene expression in the cortex and in the striatum of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that the pro-inflammatory actions of iNOS exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced injury within the cortex and striatum, and that iNOS deletion is neuroprotective in ovariectomized and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-replaced female mice </plain></SENT>
