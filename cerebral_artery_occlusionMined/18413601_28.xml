<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These involve pathways induced by endogenous neuroprotective cytokines such as erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, in contrast to its well known deleterious roles, TNF has also been shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which TNF receptor (TNFR)I mediates neuroprotection by comparing the gene expression profiles of lesioned cortex from WT and TNFRI KO mice after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several known neuroprotective molecules were identified as TNFRI targets, notably members of the Bcl-2 family, DNA repair machinery and cell cycle, developmental, and differentiation factors, <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> and growth factors, as well as their receptors, including EPO receptor (EPOR), VEGF, colony-stimulating factor receptor 1, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed that induction of EPOR and VEGF expression in primary cortical neurons after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (GD) largely depended on TNFRI and was further up-regulated by TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, EPO- and VEGF-induced neuroprotection against GD, oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> excitotoxicity depended significantly on TNFRI presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, EPO prevented neuronal damage induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> in WT but not TNFRI KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results identify cross-talk between tissue protective cytokines, specifically that TNFRI is necessary for constitutive and GD-induced expression of EPOR and VEGF and for EPO-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
