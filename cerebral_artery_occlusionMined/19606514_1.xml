<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether EGb 761 modulates the neuroprotective effects through Akt and its downstream targets, Bad and FKHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24 hours after MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential activation was mearsured by phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473), Bad at Ser(136), and FKHR at Ser(256) using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 prevented the injury-induced decrease of pAkt and its down stream targets, pBad and pFKHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EGb 761 prevented the injury-induced increase of cleaved caspase-3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study suggests that EGb 761 prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to brain injury and that EGb 761 protection is affected by preventing the injury-induce decrease of Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
