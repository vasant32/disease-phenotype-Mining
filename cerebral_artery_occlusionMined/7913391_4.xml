<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were treated with 1 mg/kg of MK-801 or saline 30 min before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser irradiation with intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye was used to cause thrombotic distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral common carotid artery was occluded permanently and the contralateral carotid artery for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Head temperature was controlled at 36 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined with laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three days after the ischemic insult, brains were perfusion-fixed and volumes of cortical (complete and incomplete) infarction were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in physiological variables or CBF between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Volumes of complete infarction were equivalent between the two groups (94.9 +/- 15.6 mm3 and 91.6 +/- 14.0 mm3 in the control and MK-801 treated groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MK-801 treated group, the volume of incomplete infarction was reduced by 44% (6.4 +/- 1.7 mm3 vs. 3.6 +/- 2.1 mm3 in control and MK-801 treated groups, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the zone responsive to MK-801 was small in this thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model, our present study revealed that MK-801 has a beneficial effect on the tissue zone containing selective neuronal alterations (incomplete infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results support the concept that this drug is effective in the area of less severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
