<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preventing excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release is known to be neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of increased NAAG is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats to investigate the neuroprotective effect of NAAG via its action as a metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (mGlu) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats received intracerebral injections of NAAG (1, 2, or 4 micromol), or a co-injection of NAAG (2 micromol) and the non-selective mGlu receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, (R,S)-alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-carboxyphenylglycine, (MCPG, 2 micromol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the treatment, the animals received 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 1 or 2 micromol of NAAG significantly reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MCPG partially attenuated the neuroprotective effect of NAAG, indicating that the protective effect of NAAG against ischemic injury may be in part mediated via activation of mGlu receptors </plain></SENT>
