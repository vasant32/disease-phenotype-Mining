<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, EPO does not cross the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EPO has been re-engineered as an IgG-EPO fusion protein, where EPO is fused to the heavy chain of a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the mouse transferrin receptor (TfR), which is designated the cTfRMAb-EPO fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The re-engineered EPO is able to penetrate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> following intravenous (IV) administration owing to transport on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> TfR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the neuroprotective properties of EPO alone and the cTfRMAb-EPO fusion protein following IV injection were investigated in a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in the adult mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, mice were treated IV with low (1000 U/kg) and high (10,000 U/kg) doses of recombinant EPO, or with low (0.05 mg/kg) or high (1.0 mg/kg) doses of the cTfRMAb-EPO fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and neural deficit scores were quantitated 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume or neural deficit following the IV administration of either dose of EPO or the low dose of cTfRMAb-EPO fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after treatment with the 1.0 mg/kg dose of the cTfRMAb-EPO fusion protein, the hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was reduced 81% and the neural deficit was reduced 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate high degrees of neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with EPO when the neurotrophin is re-engineered as an IgG-EPO fusion protein to enable transport across the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> following IV administration </plain></SENT>
