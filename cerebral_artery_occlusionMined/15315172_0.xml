<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to explore whether the member of Bcl-2 gene family, for example, Bcl-2 and Bax, are induced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and whether expression of genes can be modulated by calcium-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, the rat cerebral ischemic models were made by occluding left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was measured by RT-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the expression of both Bcl-2 and Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Level of Bcl-2 mRNA increased steadily and level of Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased gradually at first, reached a peak after 24 h, then decreased slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After administration of nimodipine, Bcl-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the hippocampus 6 and 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, while Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was down-regulated 6 and 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can induce proto-oncogenes to express, which was associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calcium-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> can up-regulate Bcl-2 mRNA and down-regulate Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> may contribute to the anti-apoptic effect of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that pharmacological modulation of Bcl-2 family member expression could become a new strategy to manage neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
