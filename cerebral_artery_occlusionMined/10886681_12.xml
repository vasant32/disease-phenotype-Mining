<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal suture method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat (the suture model) is a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which readily lends itself to studying the pathophysiology of post-ischaemic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, variability of outcome has compromised the potential of the model, but systematic studies might characterize a consistent protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the clinical and neuropathological outcome of temporary MCAO and reperfusion in the suture model were systematically investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours or 4 h of MCAO were employed, measuring the extent of infarction at 24 h with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> or at 72 h with histopathological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was compared in three rat strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following 2 h of MCAO, motor function improved during reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley, but not in Wistar or Fischer-344 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats survived the protocol to 72 h, but 33% of Fischer-344 rats died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extents of infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> were greater and less variable in Wistar and Fischer-344 than Sprague-Dawley rats, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three strains, the extent of infarction increased with reperfusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following 4 h of MCAO, there was no improvement in motor function during reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley rats, and mortality was high at 24 h in Wistar (33%) and Fischer-344 rats (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome was only pursued in Sprague-Dawley rats to 72 h, where the extent of infarction was quite variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the extent and variability of outcome following temporary MCAO in the suture model is strain-dependent, and a consistent protocol with zero mortality was found in Wistar rats using 2 h of MCAO and 70 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
