<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) for 2 h and reperfusion for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain protein (FADD), Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1) caspase-8 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein (Daxx), the pro-apoptotic genes, were examined by methods of RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein for FADD and caspase-8 increased significantly at 1-3 h after reperfusion, peaked at 12 h, then declined markedly at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time course change of FAP-1 was consistent with that of FADD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein (Daxx) increased significantly at 3 h after reperfusion and persisted for 24 h at a high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence double-staining laser scanning showed that the immunoreactivity of FADD was localized in cytoplasm, and Daxx immunoreactivity was translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm at 3 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TUNEL-positive cells could be found in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region at 3 h and increased with time after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a possible association between expression of FADD, caspase-8, Daxx and FAP-1 genes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
