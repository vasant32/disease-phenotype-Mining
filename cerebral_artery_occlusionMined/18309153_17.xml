<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether IGF-1 improves long-term functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine whether IGF-1 overexpression through adeno-associated virus (AAV) -mediated gene transfer enhances neurovascular remodeling and improves functional outcome in a mouse model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Long-term cerebral IGF-1 overexpression was achieved with the AAV transduction system through stereotaxic injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control mice were injected with AAV-green fluorescent protein or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after gene transfer, the mice underwent permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological and behavioral analyses were performed at day 21 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IGF-1 gene transfer compared with control treatment significantly improved motor performance assessed by sensorimotor tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery was accompanied by reduced volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis with endothelial cell marker CD31 revealed that IGF-1 gene transfer potently increased neovessel formation in the periinfarct and injection needle tract area compared with AAV-green fluorescent protein transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased vascular density was associated with increased local vascular perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, AAV-IGF-1 treatment enhanced neurogenesis in the subventricular zone compared with AAV-green fluorescent protein treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that IGF-1 overexpression promoted long-lasting functional recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The improved functional performance was paralleled by enhanced neovascularization and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
