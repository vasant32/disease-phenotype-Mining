<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to study the events that take place with occlusions that last longer than 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based upon <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), the tissue with high oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous sequential PET study in anesthetized baboons, we documented that when reperfusion was initiated at 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the region with the acutely highest OEF was not incorporated within the final magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, suggesting reperfusion prevented such demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this hypothesis, we report here using the same sequential PET paradigm with final <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-stage volume MRI that a 20-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in, on average, 36% of the highest OEF area being recruited into the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the portion of the highest OEF area that went on to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had at the earliest time-point significantly lower cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism (mean reductions relative to unoccluded side, 56% and 32%, respectively) than the portion that did not (41% and 11%, respectively) and that some reperfusion occurred in the latter at second time-point, that is, before recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, apart from duration of occlusion, the fate of the at-risk tissue is predicated by the initial severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as by early secondary events such as partial spontaneous reperfusion </plain></SENT>
