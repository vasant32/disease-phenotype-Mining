<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (15, 30, 60 min) and recirculation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were studied in 18 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The change of cortical oxygen tension (CoPo2) accompanying <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was also recorded in 12 rabbits and was compared with the results of CBF recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF and CoPo2 immediately decreased to a minimal level following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and partially improved in the first 5 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF and CoPo2 values in the first 5 min following occlusion were significantly higher than the minimal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of CBF and CoPo2 recovery in the first 5 min of occlusion had a statistically significant correlation with the minimal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was postulated that local tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was responsible for this recovery in the early occlusive phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF and CoPo2 became relatively stable after 5 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that following embolic occlusion, the degree of recovery of CBF following its initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms that differentiate between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postischaemic hyperperfusion was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after 15 to 60 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of postischaemic hyperperfusion did not correlate with the CBF value just before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of postischaemic hyperperfusion had a significant correlation with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the CBF value just before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It could be concluded from our results that the magnitude of postischaemic hyperperfusion represented the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, at least up to 60 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
