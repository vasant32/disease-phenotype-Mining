<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficient homing of the cells to the injured brain without complications is necessary to realize the therapeutic potential of cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial (IA) infusion of cells bypasses the filtering organs and directs the cells to the target area more efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the biodistribution of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMMSCs) after a direct infusion into the external carotid artery (ECA) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells, which were cultured without animal-derived agents and also treated with a proteolytic enzyme to transiently modify cell surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins, were infused 24h after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT imaging was used immediately after cell infusion and 24h thereafter to track (111)In-oxine-labeled BMMSC in sham-operated and MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IA infusion of BMMSCs in rats resulted in immediate cell entrapment in the brain, but the majority of the signal disappeared during the next 24h and relocated to the internal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MCAO rats, radioactivity counts 24h after infusion were higher in the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that IA infusion through ECA is a safe and efficient administration route for BMMSCs resulting in a transient localization of cells in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
