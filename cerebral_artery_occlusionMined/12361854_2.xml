<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated the effects of EA treatment on the activations of survival Akt and proapoptotic caspase-9 after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of phospho-Akt (p-Akt) increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere after tMCAO with a peak at 8 h, and EA enhanced the Akt expression both in the number and the staining strength mainly in the ischemic penumbra (IP) at 8 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cleaved caspase-9 was strongly induced at 8 h in IP, which was suppressed with EA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EA potentiated the Akt and suppressed the caspase-9 activations, and may have a potential to reduce the number of neuronal cells undergoing apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
