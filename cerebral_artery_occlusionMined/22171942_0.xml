<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the large-scale miRNA microarrays and bioinformatics analysis were used to determine the differentially expressed miRNAs and their PKC-isoform specific gene network in mouse brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> and 6 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found 4 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated miRNAs in the cortex of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> mice, 26 increased and 39 decreased gene expressions of miRNAs in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of 6 h MCAO mice, and 11 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated miRNAs in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> and 6 h MCAO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on Diff Score, 19 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> and 6 h MCAO mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the miRNA-gene-network of 19 specified miRNAs target genes of cPKCβII, γ and nPKCε-interacting protein was predicted by using bioinformatics analysis of genome databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the down-regulated miR-615-3p during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> had a detrimental effect on the oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced N2A cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the identified 19 miRNAs, notably miR-615-3p, might target these genes of cPKCβII, γ and nPKCε-interacting proteins involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
