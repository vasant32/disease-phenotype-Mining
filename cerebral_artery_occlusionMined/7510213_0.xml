<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrastriatal injection of 80 nmol Bic increased DOPAC level except <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and HVA in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increase of striatal DOPAC was statistically significant in the MCAO group as compared with that in the non-ischemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The above effects of intrastriatal Bic on <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and its metabolites were completely reversed with an intranigral injection of 5 nmol of substance P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the effect of intrastriatal Bic on <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> metabolites in the striatum is mediated by substance P in the substantia nigra and that the regulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and SP on striatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> is working in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
