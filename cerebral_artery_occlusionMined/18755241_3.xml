<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the therapeutic effect of autologous transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbit permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) models were intravenously injected with ex vivo expanded autologous BMSCs (n = 8), EPCs (n = 8), or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>14 days after the transplantation, both infusion groups witnessed a functional improvement, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and an increase in the microvessel density in the ischemic boundary area, as compared to vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EPCs treated group also exhibited a diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in comparison with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that few transplanted BMSCs expressed markers for astrocytes (GFAP+) and neurons (NeuN+), and most of EPCs were capable of binding to UEA-1 lectin and were incorporated into capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that both BMSCs and EPCs, despite differences in their action mechanism, can be functional cytoreagents for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
