<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upstream from the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> promoters and executioners are several kinases that, once activated by phosphorylation, may activate several transcription factor substrates involved in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined, by immunohistochemistry, the expression of phosphorylated (active) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p-38 kinase at early stages (1-4 h) following 1 h of MCAO in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of phosphorylation-dependent, active transcription substrates of these kinases, including cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) Alk-1, ATF-2, c-Myc and c-Jun was examined at early stages following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased nuclear phosphorylated SAPK/JNK (SAPK/JNK-P) and c-Jun-PSer63, and reduced CREB-P, occurred in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core at 1 h following reperfusion, suggesting increased phosphorylated SAPK/JNK and c-JunSer63, together with decreased phospho-CREB associated with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, increased cytoplasmic expression of MAPK/ERK-P, SAPK/JNK-P, p38-P, CREB-P, Elk-1-P, c-Myc-P, ATF-2-P and c-Jun-P occurred in the region bordering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core (penumbra) at 4 h following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that different signals converge in the cytoplasm of neurons located at the borders of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 4 h following reperfusion, revealing the struggle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> promoters and life facilitators at the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether phosphorylated kinases and specific substrates participate in promoting cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival in the penumbra probably depends on additional factors and on the interaction with other proteins </plain></SENT>
