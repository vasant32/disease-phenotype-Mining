<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) regulations, typically involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibitors (TIMPs) as mediators, became interesting since tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-related <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown with risk of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was considered to involve these mediators too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite high clinical relevance, detailed interactions are purely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a pilot study addressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> as potential neuroprotective co-treatment to tPA, we analyzed interrelations between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-P), MMPs and TIMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Rats underwent embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (eMCAO) and treatment with normobaric (NBO) or hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), tPA, tPA+HBO, or no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-P was assessed by intravenously applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin at 4 or 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMP-2/-9 and TIMP-1/-2 serum levels were determined at 5 or 25 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time point-corrected partial correlations were used to explore interrelations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-P in ischemic regions (extra-/intravasal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin ratio) and related serum markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-P correlated positively with MMP-2 and MMP-9 in controls, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> led to an inverse association, most pronounced for HBO/MMP-9 (r = -0.606; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, positive coefficients were observed after treatment with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment with HBO attenuated and in part reversed this effect, but to a lower degree than HBO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Amongst MMPs and TIMPs, significant associations shifted from MMP-9 to -2 when comparing treatment with HBO/tPA and tPA+HBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TIMPs were significantly interrelated after tPA, tPA+HBO, and interestingly, HBO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HBO was found to reverse the positively directed interrelation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-P and MMPs after eMCAO, but this effect failed to sustain in the expected amount when HBO and tPA were given simultaneously </plain></SENT>
