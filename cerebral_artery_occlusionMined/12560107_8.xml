<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals received a single injection of vehicle (n=8), 1 mg/kg (n=6), or 3 mg/kg (n=7) 30 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volume was reduced only in the group receiving 3 mg/kg M40401 (163.5+/-18.7 versus 43.4+/-7.0 mm(3), for vehicle and M40401, respectively; P&lt;0.05), with almost complete reduction of lesion volume in the cortex but little protection in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological score was also improved in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose of 1 mg/kg M40401 had smaller and inconsistent effects on lesion parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of a single dose of 3 mg/kg M40401 at 60 min of MCAO or at the end of MCAO (90 min) failed to significantly reduce lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single dose of M40401 plus prolonged infusion into the post-MCAO period also failed to decrease lesion volume significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that M40401 protects cerebral tissue from ischemic insult when administered before MCAO, probably by limiting damage mediated by detrimental actions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
