<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent clinical evidences indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may have beneficial effects on the functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of delayed postischemic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats exposed to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated for 3 months with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> beginning from 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI, behavioral analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> showed the significant recovery in spatial learning without the decrease in serum total cholesterol level and worsening of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microangiography showed a significant increase in capillary density in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi>-treated rats after 3 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, BrdU/CD31-positive cells were significantly increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi>-treated rats after 7 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAP1B-positive neurites were also increased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> showed the reduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> after 7 days of treatment and the reduction of A beta deposits in the thalamic nuclei after 3 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, delayed postischemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> had beneficial effects on the recovery of cognitive function without affecting the infarction size after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pleiotropic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi>, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, neuritogenesis, and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production and A beta deposition, might be associated with a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
