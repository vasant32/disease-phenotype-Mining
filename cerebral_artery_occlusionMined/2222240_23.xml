<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 29 patients with strictly subcortical large striatocapsular infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> or neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or selective carotid angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography for assessment of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and cerebral perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signs were compatible with cortical territorial infarctions rather than lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On both magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans, the lesions corresponded to the territories of the medial and lateral group of the lenticulostriate arteries, Heubner's artery, or the anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarctions were either due to cerebral embolization into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or due to stenosis at the same site, ie, lesions that acutely and simultaneously occluded the orifices of the lenticulostriate or neighboring arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral arteries and a decrease of cortical regional cerebral blood flow were only found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> or neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> or neglect showed a rapid recanalization of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or a stenosis of the M1 segment and no cortical regional cerebral blood flow decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large striatocapsular infarctions occur due to occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery (large-vessel disease) and not due to a disseminated in situ occlusion of the long penetrating arteries (small-vessel disease), as in lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological deficits can be explained by decreased cortical blood flow due to a persistent occlusive lesion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
