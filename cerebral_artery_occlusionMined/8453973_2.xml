<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model in cats, we studied the effect of Duxil (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53778">almitrine</z:chebi> and raubasine combination), which was given either before and after or only after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in terms of neurological function and histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was assessed consecutively for 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion using a categorical rating scale in 18 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was significantly improved in treated animals than in non-treated controls regarding to the motor and sensory function, walking, posture and stepping reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed on the 8th day and histological changes were examined by light and electron microscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in the morphological scores based on the light-microscopy changes were found in animals treated with Duxil compared to non-treated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the electron microscopy, the protective effects of Duxil were characterized by retaining <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphological improvement was associated with the recovery of neurological function and especially profound in penumbra areas of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Duxil has a protective effect against ischemic damage induced by occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in cats </plain></SENT>
