<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel agent, (R)-(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid (ONO-2506), has a unique property in that it modulates functions of activated cultured astrocytes, including pronounced inhibition of S-100beta synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether administration of this agent would mitigate the delayed expansion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the neurologic deficits after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daily intravenous administration of ONO-2506 (10 mg/kg) abolished the delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion between 24 and 168 hours after pMCAO, whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion until 24 hours was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The agent significantly reduced the expression of S-100beta and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the activated astrocytes and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2;-deoxyuridine 5;-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling-positive cells in the periinfarct area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficits were significantly improved, compared with the vehicle-treated groups, as early as 24 hours after the initial administration of ONO-2506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The agent had a wide therapeutic time window of 0 to 48 hours after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that because of the pharmacologic modulation of astrocytic activation induced by ONO-2506, symptoms can regress whereas delayed expansion of the lesion is arrested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic modulation of astrocytic activation may confer a novel therapeutic strategy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
