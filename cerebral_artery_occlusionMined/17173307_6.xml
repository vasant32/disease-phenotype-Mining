<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain uptake of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> was measured in treated (PG+) and untreated (PG-) rats using a (14)C <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> technique in rat brains (N = 10) that had undergone two hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and three hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another group of PG+ and PG- rats (N = 8) underwent MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion-weighted (DW) images were acquired on a 4.7T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rapid T1 mapping protocol was implemented to acquire a baseline data set followed by postinjection data sets at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were postprocessed pixelwise to generate permeability coefficient color maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in (14)C <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> space was observed on the ischemic side of PG+ rats only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permeability coefficient estimates obtained by MRI from the ipsilateral hemisphere in PG+ rats were significantly lower than those in PG- rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change on the contralateral side in PG+ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show that PG protects the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and MRI measurements are sufficiently sensitive to noninvasively detect small drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI is useful for evaluating the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> blocking effect of PG in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model of rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> experiment agree well with findings from the (14)C <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> technique </plain></SENT>
