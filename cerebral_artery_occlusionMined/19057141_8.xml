<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> inhibits the apoptotic signal through the activation of Raf-MEK-ERK and its downstream targets, including 90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly decreases the number of TUNEL positive cells in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that levels of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation decrease in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> prevents the injury-induced decrease of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, it inhibits the injury-induced decrease of p90RSK and Bad phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevents the injury-induced reduction of interaction between pBad and 14-3-3 and inhibits the activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevents the injury-induced an increase of cleaved PARP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting from ischemic brain injury, and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK/p90RSK cascade </plain></SENT>
