<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NMI with miniature biosensors enables neurotransmitter and neuropeptide (NT) imaging; each NT is imaged with a response time in milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A semiderivative electronic reduction circuit images several NT's selectively and separately within a response time of minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial resolution of NMI biosensors is in the range of nanomicrons and electrochemically-induced current ranges are in pico- and nano-amperes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously with NMI, the LDF technology presented herein operates on line by illuminating the living brain, in this example, in dorso-striatal neuroanatomic substrates via a laser sensor with low power laser light containing optical fiber light guides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NMI biotechnology with BRODERICK PROBE(®) biosensors has a distinct advantage over conventional electrochemical methodologies both in novelty of biosensor formulations and on-line imaging capabilities in the biosensor field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NMI with unique biocompatible biosensors precisely images NT in the body, blood and brain of animals and humans using characteristic experimentally derived half-wave potentials driven by oxidative electron transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin is a first line clinical treatment prescribed to halt the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, BRODERICK PROBE(®) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> biosensors and LDF laser sensors are placed in dorsal striatum (DStr) dopaminergic motor neurons in basal ganglia of brain in living animals; basal ganglia influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> such as those correlated with AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these studies is to understand what is happening in brain neurochemistry and cerebral blood perfusion after causal AIS by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in vivo as well as to understand consequent enoxaparin and reperfusion effects actually while enoxaparin is inhibiting blood clots to alleviate AIS symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This research is directly correlated with the medical and clinical needs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data are clinically relevant, not only to movement dysfunction but also to the depressive mood that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients often endure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These are the first studies to image brain <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> while any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> medications, such as anti-platelet/anti-thrombotic and/or anti-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> are working in organ systems to alleviate the debilitating consequences of brain trauma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
