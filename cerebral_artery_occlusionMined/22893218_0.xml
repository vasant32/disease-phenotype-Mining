<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES To assess a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensities score (FVHS) and explore its relationship with recanalization status and clinical outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> unit in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS Consecutive patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, thrombolysed within 6 hours, were selected from our prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FVHS (range, 0-10; divided into low, medium, and high thirds) was quantified on the magnetic resonance image obtained at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rates, infarction size (Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score applied to diffusion-weighted imaging [ASPECTS-DWI]), and 3-month functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor outcomes and large infarctions were defined as a modified Rankin Scale score higher than 2 and an ASPECTS-DWI score of 5 or lower, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Interaction among FVHS, recanalization status, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Thirty-four patients had a low FVHS (≤4), 32 had a medium FVHS (5 or 6), and 39 had a high FVHS (≥7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &amp;gt;2) was higher for the group with low FVHSs than those with medium FVHSs and high FVHSs (82.3% vs 43.7% and 43.5%, respectively; P &amp;lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of 24-hour large infarctions (ASPECTS-DWI score ≤5) was higher for those with low FVHSs than those with medium and high FVHSs (88.2% vs 56.2% and 51.3%, respectively; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recanalization rate was not associated with FVHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis retained low FVHS as an independent early predictor of poor clinical outcome (odds ratio = 9.91; 95% CI, 2.01-48.93; P = .004) and large infarction (odds ratio = 6.99; 95% CI, 1.78-27.46; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low FVHS remained associated with poor outcomes regardless of recanalization status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization in patients with a low FVHS decreased the poor functional outcome rate from 100% to 64.7% (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The FVHS is an early independent prognostic marker for patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Synergy between FVHS and recanalization status appears to be a critical determinant of final outcomes, supporting intensive reperfusion treatment for patients with a low FVHS </plain></SENT>
