<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the question of optimal dosing still remains unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the use of oxygen at different concentrations by either normobaric oxygenation (NBO) or hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) at different pressures in a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 90 min of reperfusion before oxygen treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxygen was applied either by NBO (100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>; 1.0 absolute atmosphere, ATA) or HBO (100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>; 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0 ATA) for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and clinical outcome measured 24 h and 7 days following the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant and long-lasting reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was seen in the HBO 2.5 ATA and 3.0 ATA groups over a period of 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was accompanied with a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcome in the high-dose oxygen-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presented data indicate that oxygen is a highly neuroprotective molecule in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, when applied early and at high doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect is dose dependent and shows a superiority of HBO over NBO, when the primary endpoints <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction and clinical outcome are analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data are important for the development of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment studies in humans </plain></SENT>
