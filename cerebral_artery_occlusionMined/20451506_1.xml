<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the protective effect of post-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi> has not been investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the post-treatment effects of selective beta(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi> in the rat focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi> anesthetized, normothermic adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using the intraluminal suture technique confirmed by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats received intravenous infusion of saline 0.5 mL/h, esmolol 200 microg/kg/min, or landiolol 50 microg/kg/min (n=8 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion was initiated 30 min after MCAO and continued for 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were allowed to survive for 7 days, and the neurological deficit score was evaluated at 1, 4 and 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed and stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> at 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores were lower in the rats treated with esmolol or landiolol, compared with saline-treated rats at 1 day as well as 4 and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of cortical and striatum were less in the rats receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi> than in saline-treated rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current study indicates that administration of selective beta1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi> after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also improved neurological and histological outcomes following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
