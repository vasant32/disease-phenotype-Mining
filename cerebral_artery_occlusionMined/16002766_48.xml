<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> influences neurogenesis similarly in the aged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Young adult (3 months) and old (15 months) rats were subjected to 1 hour of MCAO, and new cells were labeled by intraperitoneal injection of 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (BrdU), a marker for dividing cells, for 2 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 7 weeks after the insult, and neurogenesis was assessed immunocytochemically with antibodies against BrdU and neuronal markers with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Young and old rats exhibited the same increased numbers of new striatal neurons after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, despite basal cell proliferation in the subventricular zone being reduced in the aged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-generated granule cells and basal neurogenesis in the dentate subgranular zone were lower in old compared with young animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the ability of newly formed cells to differentiate into neurons was impaired in the aged dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basal neurogenesis is impaired in the subgranular and subventricular zones of aged animals, but both regions react to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with increased formation of new neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of striatal neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is similar in young and old animals, indicating that this potential mechanism for self-repair also operates in the aged brain </plain></SENT>
