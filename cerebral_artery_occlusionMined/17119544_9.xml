<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored in a mouse model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> potential synergistic neuroprotective effects of two mediators of neuroprotection: (i) neuronal or glial precursor cells and (ii) the inhibitory neuromodulator <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embryonic stem (ES) cells, engineered to release <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> by biallelic disruption of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> kinase gene, and respective <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells were induced to differentiate into either neural or glial precursor cells and were injected into the striatum of mice 1 week before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stem cell-derived graft recipients were characterized by a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, an effect that was augmented by the release of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was strongest in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-releasing glial precursor cell recipients, which were characterized by an 85% reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft-mediated neuroprotection correlated with a significant improvement of general and focal neurologic scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> revealed clusters of implanted cells within the striatum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ES cell derived <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-releasing brain implants provide neuroprotection by synergism of endogenous precursor cell-mediated effects and paracrine <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
