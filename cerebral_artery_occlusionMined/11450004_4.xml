<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the correlation between changes in the trace of diffusion tensor [Trace(D)], regional water content and tissue ultrastructure relating to cellular (cytotoxic) and vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in cats (Kuroiwa T et al., 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was induced in the white matter of cats by a cold lesion (Kuroiwa T et al., 1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, the water content increase correlated linearly with the Trace(D) decrease in both the gray and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, both the slopes and intercepts of the correlation lines were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hydropic astrocytic swelling was seen in both structures, and in the white matter, oligodendrocytic and myelinated axonal swelling were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, the increase in Trace(D) showed a significant linear correlation with the increase in tissue water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, nerve fibers were dissociated and the extracellular space was markedly enlarged with protein-rich fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These result showed that the different slopes and intercepts of the water content--Trace(D) correlation lines for different subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, which reflect different ultrastructural localization of water, should be taken into account when evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> using Trace(D) mapping </plain></SENT>
