<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the incidence and severity of reperfusion-based HT in spontaneously hypertensive rats after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to 30 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> via the suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted, T(2)-weighted, and gradient-echo imaging were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 for longitudinal evaluation of lesion evolution, vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and HT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings on gradient-echo images were classified according to the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>: no HT; punctate or small petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (HI-1); confluent petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (HI-2); <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with absent/mild space-occupying effect (PH-1, &lt;or=30% lesion volume); and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with significant space-occupying effect and potential perihematomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (PH-2, &gt;30% lesion volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic evaluation of HT was performed after final imaging for comparison with magnetic resonance imaging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> scores based on severity were as follows: HI-1 23.1%, HI-2 30.8%, PH-1 30.8%, and PH-2 15.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to clinical observations, only PH-2 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model has a high incidence of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (46.2%) and therefore is appropriate for the evaluation of novel therapeutics targeting blood-brain barrier integrity and the reduction of symptomatic HT events (PH-2), as well as those potentially "at risk" for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> (PH-1) </plain></SENT>
