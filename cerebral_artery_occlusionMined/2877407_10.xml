<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured by hydrogen clearance from electrodes inserted in the caudate and the cerebral cortex within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 16 animals, a prevention of subsequent reactive hyperaemia was attempted by hypovolaemia, produced by withdrawal of blood just before the release of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypovolaemia was successful in prevention of post-ischaemic hyperaemia in five out of eight cats sacrificed at 3 h and in six out of eight animals killed after 3 and 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cats sacrificed 3 h after release of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, ischaemic sites, associated with reactive hyperaemia, showed evidence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown to proteins and significantly more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> than at the ischaemic sites without reactive hyperaemia, which otherwise failed to reveal leakage of EB tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cats sacrificed at 3 and 14 days, the ischaemic sites which showed reactive hyperaemia after release of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, revealed much more severe ischaemic brain tissue injury than was observed at the sites without reactive hyperaemia, which also did not show any EB leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that reactive hyperaemia, which follows release of major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, may play a significant role in the breakdown of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> to proteins, and in increasing the severity of post-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and of ischaemic brain tissue injury </plain></SENT>
