<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have conducted an in vivo optical imaging for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), then evaluated the protective effect of 2 package types of free radical scavenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (A and B) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, autophagy and NVU in mice after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared to vehicle treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravones</z:chebi> A and B showed a significant improvement of clinical scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 48 h after 90 min of tMCAO with great reductions of in vivo fluorescent signal for MMPs and early apoptotic annexin V activations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo imaging of MMPSense 680 or annexin V-Cy5.5 showed a fluorescent signal, while which was remarkably different between vehicle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> groups, and colocalized with antibody for MMP-9 or annexin V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> A and B ameliorated the apoptotic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in immunohistochemistry, and activations of MMP-9 and aquaporin 4 with reducing autophagic activations of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> in both packages showed a similar strong neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which was confirmed with in vivo and ex vivo optical imagings for MMPs and annexin V as well as reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, inhibiting apoptotic/autophagic mechanisms, and protecting a part of neurovascular unit </plain></SENT>
