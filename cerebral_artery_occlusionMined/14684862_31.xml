<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) cause an expansion of core-infarcted tissue into adjacent penumbral regions of reversible injury and have been shown to occur through 6 hr after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation proceeds through 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> occurrence through 72 hr after both transient and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) via continuous DC recordings in nonanesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> occurred an average 13 times before reperfusion at 2 hr and then ceased for an average approximately 8 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After this quiescent period, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> activity re-emerged in a secondary phase, which reached peak incidence at 13 hr and consisted of a mean 52 PIDs over 2-24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phase corresponded to the period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation; rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth through 24 hr coincided with changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> frequency and peaked at 13 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In permanent MCAo, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> also occurred in a biphasic pattern with a mean of 78 events over 2-24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parameters of secondary phase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> incidence correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in transient and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The role of secondary phase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development was further investigated in transient MCAo by treating rats with a high-affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> at 8 hr after injury, which reduced post-treatment <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> incidence by 57% and provided 37% neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Topographic mapping with multielectrode recordings revealed multiple sources of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> initiation and patterns of propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> contribute to the recruitment of penumbral tissue into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core even after the restoration of blood flow and throughout the period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation </plain></SENT>
