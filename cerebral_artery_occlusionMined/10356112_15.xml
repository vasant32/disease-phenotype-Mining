<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> FK506 provides neuroprotection in experimental brain injury and suggest that this action may be mediated by suppression of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activation that occurs after ischemic depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether FK506 reduces histological injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat and whether the neuroprotective effect is mediated via suppression of in vivo nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under controlled conditions of normoxia, normocarbia, and normothermia, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO by the intraluminal occlusion technique in a blinded, randomized experimental trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral parietal cortical laser-Doppler flowmetry was monitored throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to 4 pretreatment groups: intravenous FK506 0.3 mg/kg or 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>0 mg/kg, vehicle (cremaphor), or an equivalent volume of saline administered 30 minutes before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was assessed by a triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, microdialysis probes were placed bilaterally into the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 3 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> for 3 hours and then subjected to 2 hours of right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous 0.3 mg/kg FK506 or cremaphor was given 30 minutes before right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Right-left differences between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> in the effluent were assumed to reflect differences in NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> values are mean+/-SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FK506 at 0.3 mg/kg reduced infarction volume in cortex: 40+/-12 mm3 compared with saline (109+/-15 mm3) and cremaphor vehicle (148+/-23) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Striatal infarction was also reduced by low-dose FK506: 16+/-4 mm3 versus 36+/-4 mm3 and 34+/-4 mm3 in saline and vehicle groups, respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>High-dose treatment reduced infarction volume in cortex (61+/-14 mm3, P&lt;0.05 from saline and vehicle groups) and in striatum (22+/-5 mm3, P&lt;0.05 from saline and vehicle groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> recovery via microdialysis was markedly enhanced in ischemic compared with nonischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> recovery was not different in FK506-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that FK506 provides robust neuroprotection against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of protection in vivo is not through attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked NO production during MCAO and early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
