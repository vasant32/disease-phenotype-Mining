<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are oxygen-sensitive and depict oxygen extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In several studies they have been used to describe the penumbra in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation between rCBF and qT2' has been performed to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study a correlation between rCBF and qT2' was performed in a temporary middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusion</z:e>-reperfusion model of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed on seven Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 60 min of occlusion and 90 min of reperfusion MRI was performed including DWI, dynamic susceptibility contrast-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DSC-MRI) and qT2' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ROIs were placed inside the DWI lesion and transferred to rCBF- and qT2'-maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rCBF and qT2' were compared to corresponding tissue in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: qT2' was lower in the infarcted areas when compared to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation between rCBF and qT2' was r = 0.41, p = 0.14 (Pearson's correlation coefficient), when corrected for outliers it was r = 0.58, p = 0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that there is a moderate correlation between rCBF and qT2' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>qT2'-maps could be used to explore cerebral perfusion without the application of contrast agent or radiation </plain></SENT>
