<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of nestin and vascular endothehal growth factor (VEGF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in rat brain tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury and their changes in response to Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese herbal preparation) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by treatment with Tongxinluo at high and low doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after MCAO, nestin and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in the ependyma, subventricular zone (SVZ), and hippocampal subdentate gyrus zone (HDG) in the ischemic hemisphere were quantitatively analyzed using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operated group, the rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury showed significantly increased nestin-positive neurons and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the SVZ and HDG 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Tongxinluo, especially at high doses, significantly increased the number of nestin-positive neurons and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the rats 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats results in rapid response and proliferation of neural stem cells in the SVZ and HDG in the ischemic hemisphere possibly by increasing VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the adjacent tissues around the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tongxinluo may enhance the differentiation and proliferation capacity of the neural stem cells after MCAO by inducing the expression of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
