<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO; Epoetin-alpha; PROCRITtrade mark) has been shown to exert neuroprotective and restorative effects in a variety of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> injury models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited information is available regarding the dose levels required for these beneficial effects or the neuronal responses that may underlie them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated the dose-response to rhEPO and compared the effects of rhEPO with those of carbamylated rhEPO (CEPO) in a model of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) were treated with rhEPO or CEPO, starting at 6 h and repeated at 24 and 48 h, after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed at 28 days and neurological impairment at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: rhEPO at dose levels of 500, 1150 or 5000 IU kg(-1) or CEPO at a dose level of 50 microg kg(-1) significantly reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reduced neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> doses of rhEPO, but not CEPO, produced a transient increase in haematocrit, while rhEPO and CEPO substantially reduced the number of apoptotic cells and activated microglia in the ischemic boundary region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data indicate that rhEPO and CEPO have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, even with administration at 6 h following embolic MCAo in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these actions of rhEPO and CEPO are likely to contribute to their reduction of neurologic impairment following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
