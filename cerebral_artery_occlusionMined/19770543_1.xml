<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI-selected patients (n=15) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> divided into two groups (&lt;or=3 h and 3-6 h) were treated with intravenous rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was performed before rt-PA, at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed 24 h after thrombolysis, and clinical status was evaluated before rt-PA treatment, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after thrombolysis by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modified rankin scale (MRS) was used to assess clinical outcome at 30 and 90 days after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant between &lt;or=3 h and 3-6 h group in length of hospital stay, recanalization, MRS, and favorable outcome at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization within 24 hours occurred in 9 (60%), and nonrecanalization in 6 (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient in recanalization group and three in nonrecanalization group had an asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) within 24 h after thrombolysis (P=0.235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization with thrombolysis was associated with a better outcome regardless of the time point of rt-PA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison with nonrecanalization group, recanalization was also associated with a lower NIHSS score at 14 days (P=0.003), a lower TIMI grade at 7 days (P&lt;0.001), and a shorter length of hospital stay (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-based thrombolysis using rt-PA was safe and reliable in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in 3-6 hours </plain></SENT>
