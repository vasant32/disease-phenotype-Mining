<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the hypothesis that cerebral ischemic tolerance induced by hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) is associated with an increase of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g, n=74) were divided into sham, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min, and MCAO plus HBO-PC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC was conducted four times by given 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmosphere absolute (ATA), for 1 h at every 12 h interval for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after the last HBO-PC, MCAO was performed and at 24 h after MCAO, neurological function and Nissl Staining were performed to evaluate the effect of HBO-PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content, activity of catalase (CAT), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-px) sampled from the hippocampus, ischemic penumbra or core of cortex were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC decreased mortality rate, improved neurological recovery, lessened neuronal injury, reduced the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and increased the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of CAT and SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrated that an upregulation of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity by HBO preconditioning plays an important role in the generation of tolerance against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
