<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of pretreatment with the p38-inhibitor SB203580 on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown was investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were given SB203580 (n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) in the right lateral ventricle prior to transient (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were examined with serial MRI during MCAO, at reperfusion and after 1 and 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on T2-weighted images after 1 day was significantly higher in the SB203580-treated group than in controls (300 +/- 95 mm3 vs 126 +/- 75 mm3; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> leakage, indicating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown, was significantly larger in the SB203580-treated group than in controls after 1 day (median leakage score 18.5; range 15-21 vs 6.5; 4-17; P &lt; 0.05) and 4 days (11; 6-15 vs 3.5; 1-9; P &lt; 0.05), although no significant difference was seen initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with SB203580 may aggravate ischemic brain injury and cerebral vascular leakage in the present model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
