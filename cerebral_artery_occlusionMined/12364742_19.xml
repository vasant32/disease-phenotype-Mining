<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> are neuroprotective, hormonal effects limit their clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> analogues with neuroprotective function but lacking hormonal properties would be more attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the neuroprotective effects of a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48078">2-adamantyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> analogue, ZYC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytotoxicity was induced in HT-22 cells by 10 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-Estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) or ZYC3 was added immediately before the exposure to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of E2 and ZYC3 to human alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors was determined by ligand competition binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury was induced by temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E2 or ZYC3 (100 microg/kg) was administered 2 hours or immediately before MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was recorded during and within 30 minutes after MCAO by a hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZYC3 significantly decreased toxicity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> with a potency 10-fold that of E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ZYC3 did not bind to either ERalpha or ERbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced to 122.4+/-17.6 and 83.1+/-19.3 mm(3) in E2 and ZYC3 groups, respectively, compared with 252.6+/-15.6 mm(3) in the ovariectomized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During MCAO, both E2 and ZYC3 significantly increased cerebral blood flow in the nonischemic side, while no significant differences were found in the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, E2 and ZYC3 significantly increased cerebral blood flow in both sides within 30 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ZYC3, a non-receptor-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> analogue, possesses both neuroprotective and vasoactive effects, which offers the possibility of clinical application for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without the side effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that both the neuroprotective and vasoactive effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> are receptor independent </plain></SENT>
