<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report that HMGB-1 and its receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4, were expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and in cultured neurons, endothelia, and glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), in mice, HMGB-1 immunostaining rapidly disappeared from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells within the striatal ischemic core from 1 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group box 1 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm was observed within the cortical periinfarct regions 2 h after ischemic reperfusion (2 h MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group box 1 predominantly translocated to the cytoplasm or disappeared in cells that colabeled with the neuronal marker NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RAGE was robustly expressed in the periinfarct region after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular release of HMGB-1 was detected by immunoblotting of cerebrospinal fluid as early as 2 h after ischemic reperfusion (2 h MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group box 1 released from neurons, in vitro, after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity, maintained biologic activity and induced glial expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-HMGB-1 antibody suppressed TNFalpha upregulation in astrocytes exposed to conditioned media from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-treated neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TNFalpha and the cytokine intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 increased in cultured glia and endothelial cells, respectively, after adding recombinant HMGB-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HMGB-1 is released early after ischemic injury from neurons and may contribute to the initial stages of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
