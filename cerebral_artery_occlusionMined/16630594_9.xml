<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The substrates degraded by ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 suggest that they play a role in turnover of extracellular matrix in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS-1 is also known to exhibit anti-angiogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their main endogenous inhibitor is tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 and TIMP-3 expression after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and to examine whether cytokines known to be up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could alter their expression by astrocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat using the filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a significant increase in expression of ADAMTS-1 and -4 in the occluded hemisphere but no significant change in TIMP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein were up-regulated by TNF in primary human astrocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased ADAMTS-1 and -4 in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, together with no change in TIMP-3, may promote ECM breakdown after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, enabling infiltration of inflammatory cells and contributing to brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that the in vivo modulation of ADAMTS-1 and -4 may be controlled in part by TNF </plain></SENT>
