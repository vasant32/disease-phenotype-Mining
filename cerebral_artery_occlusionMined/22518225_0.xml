<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We performed this study to semi-quantitatively characterize the formation of leptomeningeal collaterals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion caused by intravascular balloon inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The anatomic extent of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow from the anterior cerebral artery territory to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory during occlusion of the M1 segment was graded based on angiographically visible retrograde reconstitution of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segments on the delayed venous phase prior to and during inflation of the balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the leptomeningeal collaterals markedly improved in 5 of 7 patients and were graded as 1 (retrograde filling of distal M1 segment) in 3 patients, 2 (retrograde filling of proximal M2 segment) in 1 patient, 4 (retrograde filling of M3 segment) in 1 patient and 5 (none or minimal) in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Leptomeningeal collaterals from the anterior cerebral artery can form rapidly during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with considerable individual variability </plain></SENT>
