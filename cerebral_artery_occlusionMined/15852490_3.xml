<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of water extracts of A. senticosus (ASW) were investigated in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo, 90 min occlusion, 24 h reperfusion) of Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced by 36.6% after the peritoneal injection of ASW (100 mg[sol ]kg) compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the immunohistochemical study, ASW markedly inhibited both cyclooxygenase-2 and OX-42 expressions in the penumbral region at 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
