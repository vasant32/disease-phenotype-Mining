<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">Leukotrienes</z:chebi> are potent <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, which in a number of studies have been found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> pathology: gene variants affecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> synthesis, including the FLAP (ALOX5AP) gene, have in human studies shown correlation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, and animal studies have demonstrated protective properties of various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi>-disrupting drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study has hitherto described a significant effect of a genetic manipulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> system on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we decided to compare the damage from focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and FLAP knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Damage was evaluated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> staining and a functional test after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and 20 knockout male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality-adjusted median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was 18.4 (3.2-76.7) mm3 in the knockout group, compared to 72.0 (16.7-174.0) mm3 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> group (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a tendency of improved functional score in the knockout group (p = 0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of bone marrow cells confirmed that knockout animals had lost their ability to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since the local inflammatory reaction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is known to contribute to the brain tissue damage, the group difference seen in the current study could be a consequence of a milder inflammatory reaction in the knockout group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results add evidence to the notion that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> are important in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and that blocked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> production ameliorates cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
