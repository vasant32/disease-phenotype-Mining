<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in adult male rats by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NT-4/5 was administered intraventricularly one day before and immediately following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 1, 4 and 7 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NT-4/5 treatment reduced infarction volume by 34% when compared to control rats 1 day after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was unaltered by treatment 4 to 7 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> led to a significant reduction in levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> coding for catalytic and truncated TrkB receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This expression was unaffected by NT-4/5 treatment </plain></SENT>
