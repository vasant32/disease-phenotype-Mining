<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure to 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) resulted in an irreversible increase in absolute CP-T(2) relaxation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was not associated with signal change in the relative dynamic-dephasing images, as computed by subtracting short tau(CP) CP-T(2) images from long tau(CP) images and normalizing for long tau(CP) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A day after MCAo strong CP-T(2) hyperintensity and low apparent diffusion coefficient were evident in the striatum with a decline in relative dynamic-dephasing contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low dynamic dephasing contrast prevailed in striatum until day 5 post-MCAo, returning to control levels with similar time course to normalizing T(2) and diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results show a novel behavior of dynamic-dephasing contrast in poststroke brain tissue, providing data to assess the age of infarction in association to T(2) images </plain></SENT>
