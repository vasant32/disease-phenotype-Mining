<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and the involved mechanisms, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced with suture for 2h in rat, and the brain tissue was then reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and cerebral damage area were measured, respectively, with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining was used for histological observation, and immunohistochemistry and Western-blot analysis for detecting the activated caspase-3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both pre- (200mgkg(-1)) and post-treatment of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> decreased the neurology deficit score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> post-treatment (67, 200 and 600mgkg(-1)) showed a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> (200mgkg(-1)) significantly decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0007190'>neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex</z:hpo> and hippocampus, and reduced the expression of caspase-3 as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> was partly blunted by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="28973">strychnine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3092">bicuculline</z:chebi> alone, and almost completely blocked by coapplication of both <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of glycine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> exerts a neuroprotective role on the brain when administered before or after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such effect is possibly mediated by the activation of both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="28973">strychnine</z:chebi>-sensitive glycine receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of caspase-3 expression is involved in this neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results imply a potential therapeutic use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
