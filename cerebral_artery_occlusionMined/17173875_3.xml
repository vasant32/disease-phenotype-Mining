<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although 30-min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (30-min tMCAo) causes reproducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> in rats, it is difficult to evaluate the resulting neurological deficit using common behavioral tests such as the rota-rod test, adhesive-removal test, or narrow beam test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishment of a method of quantitative evaluation would help to develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To solve this problem, we examined whether the neurological deficit could be detected by the Montoya staircase test or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi>-induced rotation, which are commonly used in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> model induced by intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 10 to 14 days after tMCAo, the Montoya staircase test showed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> in forelimb tasks contralateral to the lesion side, whereas sham-operated rats showed no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> in both forelimbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of ipsilateral rotations induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> was also increased in tMCAo-rats at 21 days after tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although Pearson's correlations coefficient showed that the results of these tests were correlated with the infarction volume, there was no significant correlation between the results of these two tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that the neurological deficit detected by both tests might reflect the severity of ischemic injury, but each test might evaluate different aspects of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Montoya staircase test and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi>-induced rotation are useful to evaluate neurological deficit in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> induced by 30-min tMCAo </plain></SENT>
