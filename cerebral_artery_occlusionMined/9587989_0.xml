<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) is an emerging diagnostic technique that allows noninvasive imaging of intracranial vessels within parenchymal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in some patients, transcranial ultrasound is particularly hindered by insufficient ultrasound penetration through the temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates whether or not application of an echo-contrast agent in ultrasound-refractory patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) trunk occlusion enhances image acquisition enough to yield accurate diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced (CE) TCCS examinations, computed tomography scans and angiographic studies were performed in 20 patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion within 12 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 20 control persons without history or clinical signs for cerebrovascular diseases were examined using CE-TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients or control subjects did unenhanced TCCS investigations depict any color-coded vascular signal of an intracranial vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After application of 9 mL of 400 mg/mL <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based microbubbles, CE-TCCS was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, CE-TCCS examinations were repeated within 24 h, 48 h and 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (n = 20), CE-TCCS showed an occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem in 11 patients, and this vessel was clearly demonstrable on the unaffected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the affected side, the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) could be visualized in 8 of 11 subjects; in 3 patients, at least 1 of these vessels was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies confirmed the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In follow-up investigations, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had angiographic and CE-TCCS examinations consistent with vessel reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had a patent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> shown in angiographic and CE-TCCS examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk could be visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects by CE-TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CE-TCCS is a sensitive and specific ultrasound method for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk occlusion that overcomes the anatomical hindrance of inadequate acoustic bone window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This technique may help to identify patients suitable for thrombolytic therapies and monitor their response </plain></SENT>
