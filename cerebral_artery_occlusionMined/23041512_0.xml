<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether transplantation of sub-therapeutic doses of HUCBCs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> enhances cerebral vascular remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats (n=34) were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with: phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, gavaged daily for 7 days); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> (0.5mg/kg, gavaged daily for 7 days); HUCBCs (1×10(6), injected once via tail vein); and combination Simvasatin with HUCBCs, starting at 24h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi>- or HUCBC-monotherapy and MCAo-alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment 24h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly increased the perimeter of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF)-positive vessels, the diameter and density of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive arteries, and the percentage of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive endothelial cells (ECs) in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) compared with MCAo-alone or HUCBC-monotherapy 14 days after MCAo (p&lt;0.05, n=8/group); Combination treatment significantly increased the densities of vWF-vessels and αSMA-arteries as well as the densities of BrdU-ECs and BrdU-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vascular walls in the IBZ compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi>-monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increased BrdU-ECs and BrdU-SMCs were significantly correlated with neurological functional outcome 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment also significantly increased the expression of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), Tie2 and Occludin in the IBZ (p&lt;0.05, n=8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro experiments showed that combination treatment and Ang1 significantly increased capillary-like tube formation and arterial cell migration; anti-Ang1 significantly reduced combination treatment-induced tube-formation and artery cell migration (p&lt;0.05, n=6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that a combination of sub-therapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> and HUCBCs treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases Ang1/Tie2 and Occludin expression in the ischemic brain, amplifies endogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and arteriogenesis, and enhances vascular remodeling which in concert may contribute to functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
