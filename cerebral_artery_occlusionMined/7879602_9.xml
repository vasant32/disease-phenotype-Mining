<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three days after operation, GAP43 immunoreactivity first appeared in some astrocytic populations surrounding the infarcted lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction of GAP43 in those astrocytes persisted for up to 14 days and disappeared at 30 days postoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence staining confirmed that the GAP43-immunoreactive astrocytes examined were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our present data suggest that certain astrocytes could be induced to synthesize GAP43 in vivo in response to an ischemic insult in adult rats </plain></SENT>
