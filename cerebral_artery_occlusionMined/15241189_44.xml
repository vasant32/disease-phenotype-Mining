<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the possible benefits of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> administration after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male mice underwent 60-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and received <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>) 1, 6, and 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume at 48 hours after MCAO was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other mice underwent tests of well being (survival rate and body weight recovery), motor ability (grid test and rotarod), and cognitive ability (water maze) for up to 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO significantly worsened outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these tests compared with shams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">Progesterone</z:chebi> treatment was beneficial in that compared with vehicle, it significantly improved survival rate, weight recovery, and motor ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This improvement was most apparent during water maze testing, where <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>-treated mice were indistinguishable from shams in terms of acquiring the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> administration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and illustrate the need to further investigate the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> action </plain></SENT>
