<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, intravenous tissue type plasminogen activator has been shown to be effective in recanalizing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> in only about one-third of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is poor, leading to long-term disability in &gt;70% and mortality in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization alone is not the name of the game </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only timely, very rapid recanalization, achieved within minutes or at most a few hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has occurred, before irreversible brain damage develops, is effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Is intravenous tissue type plasminogen activator the best available option we have for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With recently introduced stent-based thrombectomy devices, neurointerventionalists have achieved complete recanalization rates of more than 90% in middle cerebral artery and 'T' occlusions, with a mean procedural recanalization time of less than one-hour and negligible complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 80% of patients less than 80 years of age who were treated within eight-hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in our centre achieved a modified Rankin score of 0-2 at three-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The site of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> is a factor driving the choice between a standard intravenous tissue type plasminogen activator protocol and an alternative intervention such as intravenous and/or mechanical thrombolysis to achieve early recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of intravenous tissue type plasminogen activator must be redefined in major occlusions, and the indications for endovascular therapy must also be reappraised </plain></SENT>
