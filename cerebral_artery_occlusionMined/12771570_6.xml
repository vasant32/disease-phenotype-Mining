<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proton magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy were used to measure the lesion size, the level of cerebral perfusion deficit, and ratio of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> to N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) in brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By performing sequential diffusion weighted imaging, gradient echo bolus tracking, steady-state spin echo imaging, and water-suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques, the time course of the early changes of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> peak ratio and perfusion deficit was examined in hyperglycemic rats undergoing 90-minute MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the saline-treated hyperglycemic rats, 2DG treatment at 10 minutes before MCAO significantly reduced diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity by approximately 60% and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> peak ratio by approximately 70% at 4 h after MCAO/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both spin echo-measured cerebral blood volume and dynamic gradient echo-relative cerebral blood flow showed that the restoration of blood supply recovered and remained at approximately 80% of baseline during reperfusion in 2DG-treated hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by 2DG has a beneficial effect in reducing brain injury and minimizing the production of brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> during MCAO/R in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
