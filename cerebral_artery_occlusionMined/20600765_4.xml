<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two models [middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) in primary cultured rat cortical neurons] were employed to mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) damage, in vivo and in vitro, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was measured by tetrazolium staining, and neurological functional deficits were assessed at 24h after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was studied by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal injury was assessed by morphological examination using phase-contrast microscopy and quantified by measuring the amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, cell viability was measured by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> 3'-1- (phenylaminocarbonyl)-3, 4-tetrazolium-bis (4-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-6-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi> (XTT) reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by flow cytometry, and electron microscopy was used to study morphological changes of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and Bcl-2, Bax protein expression were determined by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oral administration of GLPS (100, 200 and 400mg/kg) significantly reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, attenuated neurological functional deficits, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003204'>reduced neuronal apoptosis</z:mp> in ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In OGD model, GLSP (0.1, 1 and 10 microg/ml) effectively reduced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and relieved cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, GLPS decreased the percentage of apoptotic neurons, relieved neuronal morphological damage, suppressed overexpression of active caspases-3, -8 and -9 and Bax, and inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that GLPS protects against cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by downregulating caspase-3 activation and modulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio </plain></SENT>
