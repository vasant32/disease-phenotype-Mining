<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> for endothelial cells and also has the potential to increase vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may contribute to the recovery of brain cells from ischemic insult through potentiating neovascularization or may exacerbate brain damage by forming <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the exact role of this protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated temporal, spatial, and cellular profiles of the induction of VEGF gene expression after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis was performed to assess the chronological pattern of induction and the impact of length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was performed to ensure the selective detection of immunoreactive VEGF with an antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Temporal, spatial, and cellular changes of immunohistochemical VEGF expression were compared with different periods of reperfusion from 1 hour to 7 days after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Northern blot analysis revealed no detectable VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> became evident at 1 hour after reperfusion, peaked at 3 hours, and then decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from 1 to 3 hours made no differences in the degree and temporal profile of the subsequent induction of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(2) Western blot analysis showed no band in the control brain, but two bands with molecular weights of 38 and 45 kD, corresponding to VEGF121 and VEGF165, were induced at 1 hour of reperfusion, peaked at 3 hours of reperfusion, and then decayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) Neurons in the cerebral cortex of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory expressed VEGF at 1 hour after reperfusion with a peak at 3 hours and then diminished by 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pial cells of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory also expressed immunoreactive VEGF from 1 hour of reperfusion that was sustained until 3 to 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid induction of VEGF gene expression after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was demonstrated at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cortical neurons and pial cells were the source of VEGF production in this model, but the temporal profiles of the induction between these cells were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The early but dissociative induction of VEGF between neuronal and pial cells suggests different roles of the protein in their cells after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
