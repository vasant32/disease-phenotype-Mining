<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the potential downstream targets of Akt1 is p70 S6 kinase, p70(S6K), an enzyme implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the changes in total and phosphorylated levels of Akt1 and p70(S6K) during transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 1, 4, and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of total and phosphorylated forms of Akt1 and p70(S6K) were examined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of Akt1 on Ser473 transiently increased at 1 and 4 h of reperfusion, whereas phosphorylation of Akt1 on Thr308 was reduced during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of total Akt1 remained unchanged at 1 and 4 h of reperfusion, but decreased significantly at 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of p70(S6K) on Thr389 decreased at 1, 4, and 24 h of reperfusion, while the levels of total p70(S6K) protein remained unchanged at 1 and 4 h of reperfusion but decreased at 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that cell survival pathways, such as Akt1 and p70(S6K) signaling, are suppressed after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which may contribute to the development of neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
