<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cortex showed the greatest increase in PS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (7-10-fold) at 4 and 8 days posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenilin-1 (PS-1) levels in the contralateral cortex were significantly increased 1 day after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison, PS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content was only modestly elevated in the hippocampus and striatum at 4 and 8 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O (30-100% changes) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a breakdown in this response via cerebrovascular disease and/or genetic mutation may contribute to AD pathology </plain></SENT>
