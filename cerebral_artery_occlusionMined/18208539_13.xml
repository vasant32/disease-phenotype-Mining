<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early growth response-1 (Egr1) is a sequence-specific transcription factor (TF) which is induced under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We presently report that transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) leads to increased expression of Egr1 in the brains of adult mice and rats between 2 h and 5 days of reperfusion with a peak increase of 8-12-fold at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When subjected to transient MCAO and 3 days of reperfusion, Egr1-/- mice showed significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (by 44.9 +/- 8.4%, p &lt; 0.05) and improved neurological function than Egr1+/+ littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following transient MCAO, brains of Egr1-/- mice showed less water accumulation and decreased neutrophil infiltration (by 42 +/- 8%, p &lt; 0.05) compared to Egr1+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of activated microglia/macrophages were also significantly lower (OX42+ cells by 53 +/- 9%, p &lt; 0.05 and ED1+ cells by 59 +/- 11%) in the post-ischemic cortex of Egr1-/- mice compared to Egr1+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, post-ischemic inflammatory gene expression was less pronounced in the brains of Egr1-/- mice compared to Egr1+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preventing cerebral Egr1 protein induction with small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that target Egr1 decreased inflammatory gene expression and led to smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (by 40.2 +/- 6.9%, p &lt; 0.05) and reduced neurological deficits in rats subjected to transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, transient MCAO following adenoviral-mediated Egr1 over-expression exacerbated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by 29 +/- 5.3%, p &lt; 0.05) and worsened the neurological deficits in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate Egr1 as a significant contributor of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neuronal damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
