<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to learn the effects of erythropoietin (EPO), on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to determine neurological behavioral scores and histopathological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: In this study 30 adult Sprague-Dawney rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was constituted by intraluminal filament method with a 4-0-nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was started after two hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly divided into two groups as follow: control and EPO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saline 0.9% (0.5 ml/kg) and EPO (5 000 U/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three coronal slices in two millimeters thickness were obtained from cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem, and were stained with a 2% solution of triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transparent sheets were placed over each section and the areas of the brain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological scores were determined at 24th, 48th and 72nd hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent of ischemic area (%) in cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem level in EPO groups were less than those of control group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined that EPO group was better than controls of neurologic score and histopathologically after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that EPO may decrease ischemic area in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and it seems that EPO may be beneficial </plain></SENT>
