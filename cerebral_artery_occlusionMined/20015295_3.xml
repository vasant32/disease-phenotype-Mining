<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T-cells may play a role in the evolution of ischaemic damage and repair, but the ability to image these cells in the living brain after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to extend the technique of real-time in situ brain imaging of T-cells, previously shown in models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunological diseases</z:e>, to models of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male C57BL6 mice (6-8 weeks) (n= 3) received a total of 2-5 x 10(6) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CFSE)-labelled lymphocytes from donor C57BL6 mice via i.v. injection by adoptive transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, recipient mice underwent permanent left distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by electrocoagulation or by sham surgery under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female hCD2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice that exhibit GFP-labelled T-cells underwent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 or 48 h post-MCAO, a sagittal brain slice (1500 microm thick) containing cortical branches of the occluded middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was dissected and used for multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Our results provide direct observations for the first time of dynamic T-cell behaviour in living brain tissue in real time and herein proved the feasibility of MPLSM for ex vivo live imaging of immune response after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: It is hoped that these advances in the imaging of immune cells will provide information that can be harnessed to a therapeutic advantage </plain></SENT>
