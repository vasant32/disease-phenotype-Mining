<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the last few years, adenoviral gene transfer techniques have achieved increasing interest in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, gene therapy requires that delivered genes are translated into proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may pose a problem in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> where protein synthesis is compromized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to find out the feasibility of adenoviral GDNF and CNTF delivery in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as induced by 30 min of intraluminar middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injections of vehicle, of an adenoviral vector deleted in the E1 region (Ad-dE1) and of vectors expressing the GDNF (Ad-GDNF), CNTF (Ad-CNTF), or GFP (Ad-EGFP) gene from a CMV promoter were stereotactically placed in the dorsolateral striatum, i.e., the core of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced seven days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thread occlusion resulted in disseminated injury of the striatum, but not the overlying cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of viable neurons was significantly increased after 1 and 3 days of reperfusion both in Ad-GDNF and Ad-CNTF as compared with vehicle or Ad-dE1-treated animals, whereas the number of injured cells was significantly reduced, as shown by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining, terminal transferase biotinylated-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL), and immunocytochemistry for activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the protective effects of Ad-GDNF were similarly strong in areas of the striatum adjacent and remote of the adenoviral infusion site, while Ad-CNTF showed pronounced rescue effects in the surrounding, but rather little effects distant to the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that adenoviral delivery of neurotrophic factors may be a useful tool for the treatment of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
