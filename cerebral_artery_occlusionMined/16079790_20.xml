<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein overexpression has been observed in vivo and in vitro under stresses including heat, nutrient deprivation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments in in vivo models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> indicate that transgenically overexpressed or virally delivered <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> can enhance cell survival, but cannot always reduce lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the effects of virally delivered <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> in a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of reversible focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multislice T(2)-weighted images at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> indicated that lesion volume was reduced by 44% in HSP27-treated animals compared with controls (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between HSP70-treated and control animals (P = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blots revealed that HSP27 and HSP70 expression levels were equally high in injected hemispheres, but only the former had an effect on lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first evidence of the efficacy of gene therapy with any <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector expressing HSP27 in an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
