<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of lacidipine on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, and these effects were compared with those of nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drugs were administered orally 5 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores as described by Bederson et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> 17, 472-476, 1986) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (CIS) determined by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining method were measured 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and energy metabolites were determined by the hydrogen clearance method and an enzymatic method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the drug-untreated group, we observed low-CBF of approximate 13 ml/100 g/min during 0.5-6 hr of occlusion and extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> associated with severe neurologic deficits (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lacidipine at 1 and 3 mg/kg, although it lowered blood pressure, improved low-CBF to approximate 20 ml/100 g/min during 1.5-6 hr of occlusion and increased tissue levels of ATP 6 hr after MCAO in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine at 30 mg/kg also improved low-CBF and increased tissue levels of ATP significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the improvement of low-CBF by nicardipine was transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lacidipine at 3 mg/kg reduced CIS and ameliorated ND significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nicardipine at 30 mg/kg could not ameliorate ND in spite of a significant reduction of CIS similar to that of lacidipine (3 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the improvement of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by lacidipine may be partly due to long-lasting improvement of collateral blood supply to the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
