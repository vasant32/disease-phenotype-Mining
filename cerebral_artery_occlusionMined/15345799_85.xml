<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To date, stem cell graft-mediated neuroprotection is equated with graft survival and secretion of neurotrophic factors in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether neuroprotection by systemically delivered human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cells was dependent on their entry into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 1-hour occlusion, animals were randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatments: intravenous injection of HUCB (a subtherapeutic dose of 200,000 cells in 10 microL) with blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeabilizer (1.1 mol/L <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> at 4 degrees C) or vehicle, intravenous vehicle alone, or intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests, using elevated body swing test and passive avoidance test, were conducted at day 3 poststroke, and thereafter, animals were euthanized for: (1) immunohistochemical examination of HUCB, which were lentivirally labeled with green fluorescent protein; (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> analysis using 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>; and (3) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of trophic factors within the striatal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not detect intravenously administered low dose of HUCB cells in the brains of animals at day 3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even when cells were coinfused with a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeabilizer (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, HUCB-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased brain levels of neurotrophic factors, which correlated positively with reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and improved behavioral functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system availability of grafted cells is not a prerequisite for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotection provided that therapeutic molecules secreted by these cells could cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
