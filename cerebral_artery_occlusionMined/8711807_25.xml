<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The temporal and topographical patterns of microvascular E-selectin presentation after experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are relevant to microvascular reactivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The upregulation and fate of E-selectin antigen during 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 4) and 3 hours of occlusion with reperfusion (1 hour, n = 4; 4 hours, n = 6; 24 hours, n = 6) were evaluated in the nonhuman primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E-selectin and E:P-selectin immunoreactivities were semiquantitated with the use of computerized light microscopy video imaging and laser confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patterns of microvascular E-selectin expression, defined by the antibody E-1E4, were confirmed by complete elimination of E-1E4 binding after incubation with soluble recombinant human E-selectin: (1) Low immunoperoxidase intensity was observed in ischemic microvessels at 2 hours of occlusion extending to 4 hours of reperfusion (E-selectin/laminin = 0.32 +/- 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) A significant fraction of ischemic microvessels displayed high-intensity E-selectin signal by 24 hours of reperfusion (0.61 +/- 0.17) compared with control and nonischemic tissues (2P &lt; .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) In the contralateral nonischemic basal ganglia and other nonischemic tissues, low but significant E-selectin levels appeared by 24 hours of reperfusion (2P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter were further confirmed by an E:P-selectin immunoprobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: E-selectin antigen is distinctively and significantly upregulated in nonhuman primate brain after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The late appearance of E-selectin in nonischemic cerebral tissues suggests stimulation by transferable factors generated during brain injury </plain></SENT>
