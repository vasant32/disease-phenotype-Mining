<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of activated microglia after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (SCI) remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we established a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) rat model and treated pMCAO rats with N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ34) (an inhibitor of microglial activation), or with vehicle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we determined the differences between the PJ34-and vehicle-treated rats with respect to neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and the expression of CD11b (a marker of microglial activation), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the PJ34-treated rats had more severe neurological deficits and a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and exhibited a decreased CD11b expression, more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, decreased expression of GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein but increased expression of TNF-α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein compared with the vehicle-treated rats at 3 and 7 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that activated microglia provide a neuroprotective role through balancing GDNF and TNF-α expression following SCI </plain></SENT>
