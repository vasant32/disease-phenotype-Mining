<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data with respect to cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> patterns, posttreatment arterial recanalization, and the clinical categories of favorable/unfavorable outcome and survival/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, recanalization in patients who received thrombolytic therapy correlated significantly with clinical outcome; in 19 of 43 patients, recanalization was demonstrated angiographically, while in 24 patients the occlusion persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients without recanalization died, but 14 of the 19 patients displaying recanalization survived (p = 0.000007), 10 with a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three of the 22 patients who received conventional therapy survived, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with a moderate clinical deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we compared the treatment groups, highly significant differences in both outcome quality (p = 0.017) and survival (p = 0.0005) were found to depend on establishing recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data support the concept that technically successful thrombolysis of vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> is associated with beneficial clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
