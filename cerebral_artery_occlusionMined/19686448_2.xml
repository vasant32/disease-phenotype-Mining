<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protective effect has been demonstrated under a variety of different treatments and injury paradigms, such as in vivo and in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> is less defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, cultured cortical and midbrain mouse neurones and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells (SH-SY5Y) were exposed to combined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-serum deprivation (CGSD), which is regarded as a reliable model mimicking the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was assayed using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release and metabolic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditions for CGSD treatment were chosen to yield half-maximal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The validity of CGSD in vitro was compared with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CGSD for 4 h induced half-maximal neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO in vivo for the same period resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, also suggesting the validity of CGSD as a suitable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined steroid treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-oestradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>) but not the application of single steroids abolished CGSD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of cortical neurones in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no cell protection was found in midbrain neurones or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The co-application of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> (ICI 182,780) or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (RU-486) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> did not obviously counteract the protective steroid effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests the operation of nonclassical steroid mechanisms and their implication in mediation of hormonal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The surplus of combined protective hormonal effects might be a result of the observed influence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> application on neuronal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The data obtained in the present study clearly highlight the potential of a combined steroid treatment under toxic degenerative brain pathologies </plain></SENT>
