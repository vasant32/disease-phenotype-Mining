<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A short ischemic event [ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>)] can result in a subsequent resistance to severe ischemic injury (ischemic tolerance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to the brain damage found after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, its expression and neuroprotective role in models of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding the role of TNF-alpha convertase (TACE/ADAM17), we have recently shown its upregulation in rat brain after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and that subsequent TNF-alpha release accounts for at least part of the neuroprotection found in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now used an in vitro model of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> using rat cortical cultures exposed to sublethal oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) to investigate TACE expression and activity after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and the subsequent mechanisms of ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OGD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> by sublethal OGD 24 hr before, an effect that was inhibited by the TACE inhibitor BB3103 (1 microm) and anti-TNF-alpha antibody (2 microg/ml) and that was mimicked by TNF-alpha (10 pg/ml) preincubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that TACE expression is increased after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> caused TNF-alpha release, an effect that was blocked by the selective TACE inhibitor BB-3103 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> diminished the increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> caused by OGD and increased cellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake and expression of EAAT2 and EAAT3 <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters; however, only EAAT3 upregulation was mediated by increased TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that neuroprotection induced by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> involves upregulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake partly mediated by TACE overexpression </plain></SENT>
