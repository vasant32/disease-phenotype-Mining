<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The investigations that have thus far evaluated the cerebral protective properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> have provided conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protection would be most likely to occur in the circumstances of incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in which there is a penumbral zone of marginal perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present investigation sought to evaluate further the protective properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> in that circumstance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized with 1.2 MAC concentrations of either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of four hours of MCAO, the brains were removed, sectioned and incubated in the histochemical stain 2-3-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An image analysis system was used to measure the area of reduced or absent TTC staining in four coronal planes spanning the distribution of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anaesthetized animals with respect to the area of brain with evidence of histochemical dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> is not protective (relative to the status of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anaesthetized control animals) when administered at 1.2 MAC concentration during four hours of focal (incomplete) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
