<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hb in the carboxy state (COHb) may provide protection at relatively low volumes by enhancing vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether transfusion of rats with 10 ml/kg PEGylated COHb [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>)-COHb] at 20 min of 2-h MCAO was more effective in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with non-<z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO) <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-COHb transfusion, whole blood and plasma COHb was &lt;3%, indicating rapid release of CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-COHb transfusion significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (15 ± 5% of hemisphere; mean ± SE) compared with that in the control group (35 ± 6%), but non-CO <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-Hb did not (24 ± 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemically dissimilar COHb polymers were also effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of MCAO initially produced 34 ± 2% dilation of pial arterioles in the border region that subsided to 10 ± 1% at 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfusion of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-COHb at 20 min of MCAO maintained pial arterioles in a dilated state (40 ± 5%) at 2 h, whereas transfusion of non-CO <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-Hb had an intermediate effect (22 ± 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When transfusion of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-COHb was delayed by 90 min, laser-Doppler flow in the border region increased from 57 ± 9 to 82 ± 13% of preischemic baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-COHb is more effective than non-CO <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-Hb at reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, sustaining cerebral vasodilation, and improving collateral perfusion in a model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> when given at a relatively low dose (plasma Hb concentration &lt; 1 g/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of acellular Hb as a CO donor that is rapidly converted to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38849">oxygen carrier</z:chebi> in vivo may permit potent protection at low transfusion volumes </plain></SENT>
