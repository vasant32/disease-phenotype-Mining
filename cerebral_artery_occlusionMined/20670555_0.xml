<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the usefulness of diffusionweighted MRI (DWI) for determining an indication of emergent thrombolytic revascularization therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of twenty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the middle cerebral artery within six hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, nine patients performed thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In results, seven patients of them obtained revascularization and good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI findings on admission were correlated to the cerebral blood flow measured by SPECT and classified into four types; Type 1: no high intensity, Type 2: high intensity only in the perforator's territory, Type 3: limited high intensity in the cortical branches' territory, Type 4: extended high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As presented cases, the high intensity area seen on DWI became obvious infarction regardless of implementation of revascularization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, thrombolytic therapy could rescue the area of low CBF on SPECT and could improve clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered that the area of low CBF without high intensity on DWI was "ischemic penumbra" and classification of DWI findings could be a valuable indicator in determining an indication of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
