<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 30 adult cats, anesthetized with nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, the middle cerebral artery was occluded using a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracellular volume changes were assessed by recording cortical impedance, and correlated with blood flow, tissue osmolality, and water and electrolyte content of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, cortical impedance, after a free interval of about 1 min, sharply increased and after 30 to 60 min gradually stabilized between 180 and 200% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calculated extracellular fluid volume decreased from 23.8 +/- 1.2 to 1.3 +/- 1.0% after 1 h and to 12.5 +/- 1.0% after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shortly after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, extracellular volume shifts correlated with blood flow over a range from 3 to 50 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hours later, a threshold-like dependency existed: below 25 ml/100 g/min extracellular space was reduced to about 50% of control; above 32 ml/100 g/min extracellular space was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-threshold correlations existed between extracellular space, tissue osmolality, and the electroencephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final water content of brain tissue correlated with the size of the extracellular space after 15 min, but ont after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the narrowing of the extracellular compartment and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> are relatively independent consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
