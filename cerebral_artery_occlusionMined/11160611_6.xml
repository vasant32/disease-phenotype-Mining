<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded by inserting a thread through internal carotid artery for 2 h, and then recirculated for 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NS-7 (0.125-1 mg/kg), when injected i.v. immediately after recirculation, significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment with NS-7 at 1 h after recirculation produced an equivalent inhibition of the infarction, and was still effective, although to a lesser extent, when injected at 2 h but not 3 h after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> (4 g/kg) suppressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> but did not reduce the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the cerebral cortex or striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> does not always lead to the reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NS-7 treated in combination with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> further decreased the water content in the occluded brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NS-7 significantly lowered the mortality observed up to 10 days after a transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these data, it is suggested that the presence of NS-7 in plasma during 1 to 3 h after recirculation is important for producing the neuroprotective action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To determine the pharmacologically effective plasma concentration of NS-7, the effect of continuous infusion of this compound on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infusion of NS-7 at 0.3 mg/kg over 2 h, starting immediately after recirculation, significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its plasma concentration during 1 to 3 h was 14.5 to 28.5 ng/ml (36.9-72.3 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these finding it is suggested that NS-7 has a potent anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> action in addition to antiedema action in the rat transient MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its effective plasma concentration was assumed to be 36.9 to 72.3 nM </plain></SENT>
