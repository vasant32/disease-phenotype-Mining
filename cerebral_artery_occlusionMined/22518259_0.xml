<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the relationship between the magnitude of leptomeningeal collaterals (LMC) on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV)/regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) mismatch on computed tomography perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records, and neuroimaging studies in consecutive patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M1-segment) and proximal branch (M2-segment) occlusion undergoing endovascular treatment following the demonstration of mismatch on <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DSA images acquired prior to the treatment were used to grade collateral flow from the anterior cerebral artery to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, based on retrograde reconstitution of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segments in the late arterial phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> images were reviewed and rCBV/rCBF mismatch was categorized as minor (â‰¤ 1/3 of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory), moderate (1/3-2/3 of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory), or severe (&gt; 2/3 to complete territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical association was assessed using Pearson exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of sixteen patients were studied (10 were men; mean age of 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was 146 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with M1-segment occlusion (n=10) had more severe rCBV/rCBF mismatch compared to patients with M2-segment occlusion (p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the magnitude of LMC and severity of rCBV/rCBF mismatch on <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: The magnitude of LMC on DSA does not correlate with the severity of rCBV/rCBF mismatch in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that additional factors, such as micro vascular failure, may contribute to altered cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
