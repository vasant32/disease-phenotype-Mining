<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment options to date are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To meet the need for novel therapeutic approaches, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research frequently employs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most researchers use permanent or transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in mice or rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) via the intraluminal suture technique (so called filament or suture model) is probably the most frequently used model in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal MCAO model offers the advantage of inducing reproducible transient or permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in a relatively non-invasive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal approaches interrupt the blood flow of the entire territory of this artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Filament occlusion thus arrests flow proximal to the lenticulo-striate arteries, which supply the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Filament occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> results in reproducible lesions in the cortex and striatum and can be either permanent or transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, models inducing distal (to the branching of the lenticulo-striate arteries) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion typically spare the striatum and primarily involve the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition these models do require craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the model demonstrated in this article, a silicon coated filament is introduced into the common carotid artery and advanced along the internal carotid artery into the Circle of Willis, where it blocks the origin of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients, occlusions of the middle cerebral artery are among the most common causes of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since varying ischemic intervals can be chosen freely in this model depending on the time point of reperfusion, ischaemic lesions with varying degrees of severity can be produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion by removal of the occluding filament at least partially models the restoration of blood flow after spontaneous or therapeutic (tPA) lysis of a thromboembolic clot in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this video we will present the basic technique as well as the major pitfalls and confounders which may limit the predictive value of this model </plain></SENT>
