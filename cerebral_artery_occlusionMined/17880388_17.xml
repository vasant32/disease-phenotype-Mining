<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are important autologous transplantation tools in regenerative medicine, as they can secrete factors that protect the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether adult NSPCs genetically modified to secrete more glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) could protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NSPCs were harvested from the subventricular zone of adult Wistar rats and cultured for 3 weeks in the presence of epidermal growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NSPCs were treated with fibre-mutant Arg-Gly-Asp adenovirus containing the GDNF gene (NSPC-GDNF) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene (NSPC-EGFP; control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one experiment, cultured cells were transplanted into the right ischemic boundary zone of Wistar rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week later, animals underwent 90 min of intraluminal right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by magnetic resonance imaging and behavioural tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NSPC-GDNF group had higher behavioural scores and lesser <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume than did controls at 1, 7 and 28 days postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, we transplanted NSPCs 3 h after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, rats receiving NSPC-GDNF had decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and better behavioural assessments at 7 days post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed on day 7 and brains were collected for GDNF ELISA and morphological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, more GDNF was secreted, more NSPC-GDNF cells migrated toward the ischemic core and more NSPC-GDNF cells expressed immature neuronal marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the NSPC-GDNF group showed more effective inhibition of microglial invasion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that NSPC-GDNF may be useful in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
