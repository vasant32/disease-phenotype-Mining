<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P2X7 receptor, a subtype of a family of P2 purinoceptors, is primarily expressed in microglia and macrophages, suggesting that it regulates immune function and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of ATP in such microglial responses after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is not yet understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of ATP, especially through the P2X7 receptors, in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemical analysis, P2X7 receptor-like immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in microglia, and then activated microglia accumulated in the ischemic region, in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection with P2X7 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (BzATP) improved behavioral dysfunction accessed by rota-rod test and ischemic neural injury induced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, P2X7 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-2',3'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38124">dialdehyde</z:chebi> (OxATP) exacerbated ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that microglia play an important role in neuroprotection against rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which is regulated by a P2X7 receptor-mediated ATP signal </plain></SENT>
