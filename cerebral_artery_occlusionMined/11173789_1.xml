<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few in vivo studies were available about the relation between cerebral blood flow, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and the appearance of apoptotic cells in the development of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, we measured local cerebral blood flow (lCBF), local cerebral metabolic rate in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (lCMRglc), and histopathology in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced for 2 h in Wistar-ST rats (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A histopathological study with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining and the TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>lCBF was measured by means of the (14)C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography technique during MCAO (n = 6), and 1, 22 and 70 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>lCMRglc was also measured by autoradiography with (14)C-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> in the animals 22 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters were assessed in each region of interest: the ischemic core, boundary zones (BZ-I and BZ-II) and remote area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The boundary zones were defined as the area based on TUNEL positivity (more than 5/field) at 22 h after reperfusion (BZ-I) and at 70 h after reperfusion (BZ-II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the BZ-I, lCBF was decreased to 18% of the control during MCAO, and lCBF and lCMRglc showed 44 and 62% of the control, respectively, 22 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this area, TUNEL-positive cells increased at 22 h, then markedly decreased 70 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the BZ-II, lCBF decreased to 39% of the control during MCAO, then returned to about 90% of the control 22 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>lCMRglc was maintained near its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (82% of the control) 22 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histopathology of BZ-II was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 22 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The TUNEL positivity of neurons in our study was assumed to be a marker of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that the apoptotic process plays an important role in the maturation of a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both lCBF and lCMRglc were maintained with only a mild reduction in the predisposing phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that sufficient blood supply and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism are required to promote the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
