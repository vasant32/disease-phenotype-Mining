<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to assessment of regional cerebral blood flow and water content, the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier and morphological changes detected by light microscopy were studied at various time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our observations revealed that although a similar reduction of blood flow during <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was found both in the caudate nucleus and the cerebral cortex, the reactive hyperaemia was consistently higher in the caudate nucleus than in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 h the caudate nucleus also revealed a significantly higher water content and <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> than the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological observations at 24 h in areas affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> showed widespread, marked ischaemic neuronal injury, whereas at 3 d there was, in addition, a vigorous proliferative reaction of vascular elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cats sacrificed at 14 d revealed a remarkably good preservation of neurons, both in the caudate nucleus and cortex which otherwise showed a few circumscribed, small, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> surrounded by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nerve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that neurons injured at threshold level have a considerable capacity for recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, with a similar degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, the caudate nucleus appears more prone to <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> than the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
