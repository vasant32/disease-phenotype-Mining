<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the potential benefits of the CXC chemokine-binding protein Evasin-3, which potently inhibits chemokine bioactivity and related neutrophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in two mouse models of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first model, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with Evasin-3 as compared with Vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) was investigated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E-deficient mice implanted of a 'cast' carotid device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Evasin-3 treatment (5â€‰minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) was assessed in mice subjected to transient left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although CXCL1 and CXCL2 were upregulated in both atherosclerotic plaques and infarcted brain, only CXCL1 was detectable in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, treatment with Evasin-3 was associated with reduction in intraplaque neutrophil and matrix metalloproteinase-9 content and weak increase in collagen as compared with Vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, treatment with Evasin-3 was associated with reduction in ischemic brain neutrophil infiltration and protective oxidants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other effects in clinical and histological outcomes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that Evasin-3 treatment was associated with reduction in neutrophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in both mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, Evasin-3 administration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> failed to improve poststroke outcomes.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 19 December 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.198 </plain></SENT>
