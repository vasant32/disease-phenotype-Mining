<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>) gene and subsequent accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, which might either directly or indirectly affect the outcome of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a transgenic rat overexpressing human <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>, which was used to explore the effect of abnormally high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> concentration in the brain on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The transgenic rats were produced by the pronuclear injection technique with the use of cloned human <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was permanently occluded through craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were assayed in the infarcted and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was used to quantify T2 relaxation time, apparent diffusion constant (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which was also determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in extensive activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>, which was approximately sevenfold greater than in syngenic animals at 20 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> increased from approximately 10 and 230 pmol/mg to 160 and 410 pmol/mg in the infarcted hemisphere of syngenic and transgenic animals, respectively, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> in the transgenic rats did not influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size evolution, as determined by MRI, T2, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, or the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from the <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> transgenic rat model show that the development of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was not influenced by extensive levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, indicating that this endogenous <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> is not involved in maturation and spread of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems that <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activation reflects an endogenous adaptation of neural cells to a noxious stimulus that does not directly influence lesion development </plain></SENT>
