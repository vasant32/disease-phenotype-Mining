<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Netrins are chemotropic factors for axon with chemoattractant or chemorepellant guidance activities, and deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and neogenin are receptors for netrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined expressions of netrin-1, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, and neogenin in the brain after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 was expressed in neurons at the peri-ischemic area with a peak at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> was expressed both in neurons and astrocytic feet with a peak at 14 days, though neogenin was expressed in endothelial cells at <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory with a peak at the same time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that netrin-1 is involved in the promotion of axonal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> was overlapped both in the spatial and temporal patterns, indicating that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> plays a role in netrin-1's axonal growth promoting effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The location of neogenin positive cells differed from that of netrin-1 positive cells, thus its angiogenic activity may not have relevance with netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
