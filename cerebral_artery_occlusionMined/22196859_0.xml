<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Diallyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfide</z:chebi> (DAS) is the main organosulfur component of garlic and it is known for multiple pharmacological actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that DAS has neuroprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While some of the possible mechanisms behind this protection have been explored, its ability to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has yet to be fully explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of DAS on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats were tested and its anti-apoptotic action was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To examine the protective effects of DAS, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion was induced in rats by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours followed by reperfusion for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals received DAS in quantities of 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg (intraperitoneal; every day), for 7 days before transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological score and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured at 24 hours after the end of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cells were counted by terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining and apoptotic mechanisms were studied by fluorescence immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For animals with induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, those pretreated with 200 mg/kg DAS showed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (22.36 ± 0.67%) significantly lower than that of the non-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion group (38.23 ± 0.72%), and the percentage of terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling-positive cells (23.46 ± 1.02%) of the DAS-pretreated group was also significantly decreased compared to non-treated (36.41 ± 1.58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis indicated that DAS reduced caspase-3 expression and increased Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the mechanism by which DAS protects the brain from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury is related to its anti-apoptotic effects in part </plain></SENT>
