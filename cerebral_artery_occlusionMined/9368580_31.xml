<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to analyze, in an experimental model of short-term (&lt; 25 minutes) focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and long-term (&lt; or = 28 days) reperfusion, the extent and nature of the structural abnormalities affecting neurons and glia located within the territory of the transiently occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Wistar rats (n = 121) had the origin of one middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occluded with a nylon monofilament for periods of 10 to 25 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were terminated at variable periods ranging from 1 day to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control experiments consisted of (1) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion without reperfusion (n = 7) lasting 7 to 14 days and (2) sham operations (n = 2) followed by 1- to 4-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After in situ fixation, brain specimens were serially sectioned and subjected to detailed morphometric evaluations utilizing light and electron microscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistical method used to evaluate the results was based on ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's corrected t test and Student's t test comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain lesions</z:e> were not detectable in the sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> brains with permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (7 to 14 days) had large infarctions with abundant macrophage infiltration and early cavitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-five (37%) of the experiments involving transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion had no detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> after 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found in 76 of 121 rats (63%) with transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> always involved the striatum, and in 29% of the brains with ischemic injury, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> also included a short segment of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the striatum, the length of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was the main determinant of the number of necrotic neurons (20 minutes [22.6 +/- 19] is worse than 10 minutes [4.9 +/- 7]) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the cortex, the length of reperfusion determined the number of necrotic neurons appearing in layer 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Experiments with reperfusion of 4 to 7 days' duration yielded more necrotic neurons per microscopic field (2.02 +/- 3) than those lasting fewer days (0.04 +/- 0.1) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The histological features of these lesions underwent continuous change until the end of the fourth week, at which time necrotic neurons were still visible both in the striatum and in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Arterial occlusions</z:mp> of short duration (&lt; 25 minutes) produced, in 76 of 121 experiments (63%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> characterized by selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and various glial responses (or incomplete infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This lesion is entirely different from the pannecrosis/cavitation typical of an infarction that appears 3 to 4 days after a prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Delayed neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, secondary to a transient <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> or increasing numbers of necrotic neurons in experiments with variable periods of reperfusion, was a response observed only at a predictable segment of the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
