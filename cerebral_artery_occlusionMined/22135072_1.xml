<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Information on the clinical and hemodynamic profile of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator nonresponders, at different locations of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, may improve the selection of candidates for rescue reperfusion therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aim to investigate predictors of failing intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy according to occluded vessel and location of the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted within the first 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five hundred forty-eight patients with documented intracranial occlusion were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to site of vessel occlusion into 4 distinct groups: proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=251), distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=194), internal carotid artery bifurcation occlusion (n=61), and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed on transcranial Doppler at 1 hour of tissue-type plasminogen activator bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the presence of severe extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.15-4.84; P=0.02) and age &gt;74 years (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.02-3.31; P=0.04) independently predicted no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No independent predictors of no recanalization were identified in patients with distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with internal carotid artery bifurcation occlusion, a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 12.77; 95% CI, 2.12-76.88; P=0.05), and absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.40-47.44; P=0.02) emerged as independent predictors of no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, among patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was as an independent predictor of no recanalization (OR, 7.50; 95% CI, 1.40-40.35; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of relevant predictors of no recanalization and a rapid neurovascular evaluation may improve the selection of patients for more aggressive rescue strategies </plain></SENT>
