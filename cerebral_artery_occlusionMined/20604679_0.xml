<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of permanent unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) on the generation of bone marrow (BM)-derived astrocytes in female mice previously transplanted with enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing BM from male donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to an untreated PMCAO group, one group of mice also received intracerebral infusion of transforming growth factor-alpha, resulting in a decrease in the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two months after PMCAO, we found a specific type of astrocyte of BM origin in the side of the injury, near the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These astrocytes did not express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by conventional fluorescence immunostaining; however, GFAP was easily detectable by tyramide signal amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells also expressed S100Î², confirming their astrocytic character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the endogenous reactive astrocytes, these BM-derived astrocytes did not proliferate during the first week of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and did not contribute to the glial scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-alpha infusion increased the number of BM-derived astrocytes, without affecting their distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, exclusively by tyramide signal amplification staining, we found that endogenous astrocytes displaying an identical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were also present in control mouse and human brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that a subpopulation of nonreactive astrocytes expressing low levels of GFAP can originate from transplanted BM in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that these cells represent a subpopulation of astrocytes earlier considered to be GFAP negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high number of astrocytes with identical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and chemical character in control brains suggest that these type of astrocytes may have important functional role in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system that calls for further studies </plain></SENT>
