<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations have indicated that the detection and quantification of omega 3 (peripheral type <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi>) binding site densities that are associated with reactive astroglia and macrophages could be of widespread applicability in the localization and indirect assessment of neural tissue damage in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyze the usefulness of this approach in a number of experimental models that are characterized by (or putatively involve) <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One week after the systemic administration of the excitotoxin, kainate, a marked increase in omega 3 site densities (as assessed by [3H]PK 11195 binding) was noted, an increase that was most prominent in known regions of selective vulnerability (hippocampus and septum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the kainate-induced omega 3 site proliferation was not a function of the dose administered, a marked interstudy variation was observed, and the binding increase was prevented by the administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi>, clonazepam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The densities of omega 3 sites were studied, by autoradiography (using [3H]PK 11195 or [3H]PK 14105 as ligands), in 4 groups of Fischer 344 rats aged 3, 12, 22 and 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No age-related changes were noted except in the 30-month-old group in which discrete and focal increases (reflecting tumoral processes) were observed in various brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spontaneously hypertensive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats, omega 3 binding increases were observed concomitant with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With autoradiography, the omega 3 site increase was localized to focal increases in the boundary zones between major cerebral arteries (and corresponding to regions of ischaemic or haemorrhagic infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was studied in rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in normotensive (Wistar/Kyoto) and spontaneously hypertensive rats, the density of omega 3 sites in the ipsilateral hemisphere was markedly elevated, the increase being greater in the spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increases in omega 3 labelling in these two strains matched the absolute volumes of infarctions, determined previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the mouse also increased hemispheric levels of omega 3 sites; the maximum values were obtained between 4 and 8 days following the induction of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the feasibility of using omega 3 sites as a marker of excitotoxic, ischaemic and proliferative damage in the rodent brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Binding measurement in tissue homogenates is an economic and time-efficient approach, whereas the autoradiographic detection of omega 3 sites allows the localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> with a macroscopic or microscopic level of anatomical resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
