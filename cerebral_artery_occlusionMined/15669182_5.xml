<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To confirmed reliability and feasibility of intranasal nerve growth factor (NGF) bypassing the blood-brain barrier and its potential neuroprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (1) To assay NGF concentrations in different brain regions after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly divided into intranasal (i.n.) NGF, intravenous (i.v.) NGF, and untreated group (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of NGF of different brain regions in the three groups after MCAO were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) To observe neuroprotective action of NGF on focal cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: i.n. vehicle, i.n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NGF, i.v. vehicle, i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGF (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 30 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO and given again 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three neurologic behavioral tests were performed 24 and 48 hours following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The olfactory bulb in i.n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NGF group obtained the highest concentration (3252 pg/g) of NGF among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, followed by the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The NGF concentrations in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus in i.n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NGF group were markedly higher than that in i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NGF and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in i.n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>NGF group was markedly reduced by 38.8% compared with i.n. vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>I.n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>NGF group vestibulum function markedly improved compared with i.n. vehicle group at 24 and 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO (P24h = 0.02 and P48h = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intranasal NGF could pass through the blood-brain barrier, reach the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and improve neurologic function in rats following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Intranasal delivery of NGF may be a promising treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
