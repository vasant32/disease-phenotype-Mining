<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced striatal neurogenesis, we intraventricularly injected human VEGF(165)-expressive plasmid (phVEGF) mixed with liposome into adult rats after a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that EGFP, a reporter protein, positive cells appeared at 2 hr, further enhanced at 4 hr, reached the maximum at 3 days and still remained at 14 days after a single injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with phVEGF <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp>, as indicated by double staining of vWF, a marker of endothelial cells, and 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phVEGF treatment dose-dependently reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of brain at 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection by VEGF could be obtained when the plasmid was injected within 2 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, VEGF overexpression significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> in the ipsilateral SVZ and the numbers of BrdU(+)-CRMP-4(+) and BrdU(+)-Tuj1(+), two markers of immature newborn neurons, and BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+), a marker of mature newborn neurons, cells in the ipsilateral striatum to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present results show that VEGF plasmid treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and enhance striatal neurogenesis in adult rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that VEGF overexpression acquires significant functions of neuronal protection and repair in the injured brain, which provides a possibility to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
