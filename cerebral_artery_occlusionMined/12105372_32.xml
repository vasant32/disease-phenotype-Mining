<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In contrast to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, the effects of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have not been widely addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on secondary ischemic injury, MRI lesion size, and neurological outcome after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats (n=30) were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO, 120 minutes) by use of the intraluminal filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals of the treatment group (n=12) were exposed to whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> of 33 degrees C for 5 hours starting 3 hours after MCAO, whereas the control group (n=18) was kept at 37 degrees C throughout the whole experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The normothermia- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-treated animals were investigated daily by using the Menzies neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial MRI was performed 1, 3, and 6 hours after MCAO and on days 1, 2, 3, and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the final MRI scan, the rats were euthanized, and brain slices were stained by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> resulted in a significant increase of survival rate and a significant improvement of the Menzies score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant decrease in the extent of hyperintense volumes in T2-weighted scans and a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> as calculated from T2-weighted scans throughout the examination period were obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> examined by MRI was consistent with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that even delayed postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> can reduce the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
