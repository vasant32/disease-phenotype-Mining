<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, more effective, newer methods are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that combining the use of ferumoxide labeling and magnetic fields could enhance targeted delivery of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of a magnetic field on proliferation, viability, and differentiation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) were determined in culture, and the results indicated that the difference between control and cultures exposed to a magnetic field were insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess migration in vitro, ferumoxide-labeled cells were seeded into a culture dish that had a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi> magnet below its center, and the labeled NSCs were found to aggregate above the magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate targeted delivery of NSCs in vivo, rats were separated into three groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> only (IO), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with injection of ferumoxide-labeled cells (IC), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with injection of labeled cells and magnet exposure (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), labeled human NSCs were injected into the tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAo, ICM rats had a larger number and greater distribution of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi>-positive NSCs as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in ICM rats was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that this use of a magnetic field may be useful for improving the efficacy of targeted migration of stem cells in stem-based cell therapy in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
