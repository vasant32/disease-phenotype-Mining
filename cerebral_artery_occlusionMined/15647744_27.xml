<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A short ischemic event (ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>)) can result in subsequent resistance to severe ischemic injury (ischemic tolerance (IT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression and neuroprotective role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) have been described in models of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and we have showed the participation of its processing enzyme, the TNF-alpha convertase enzyme (TACE) in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now decided to explore the expression and localization of TNF receptors (TNFR) as well as other signalling mechanisms involved in IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A period of 10 mins of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) was used for focal <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the ability of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> to produce IT, permanent MCAO was performed 48 hours after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning produced a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, as we showed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning caused upregulation of neuronal TNFR1 that was reduced by the selective TACE inhibitor BB1101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral administration of TNFR1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, which caused a reduction in TNFR1 expression, inhibited the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-induced protective effect, showing that TNFR1 upregulation is implicated in IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment with BB1101, TNFR1 antisense and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi>-a specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi>-blocked <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-induced NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed the expression of TACE and TNFR1 in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data show that <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> produces neuronal upregulation of TACE and TNFR1, and that the pathway TACE/TNF-alpha/TNFR1/NF-kappaB is involved in IT </plain></SENT>
