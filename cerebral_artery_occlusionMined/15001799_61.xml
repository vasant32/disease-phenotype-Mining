<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes microvessel matrix degradation and generates proteases known to degrade this matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, proof that the proteases generated do indeed degrade vascular matrix is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that active proteases derived from ischemic tissue after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and transferred to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue can degrade vascular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an ex vivo bioassay, the effects of supernatants from ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basal ganglia of nonhuman primates, proteases, and control buffer on the immunoreactivity of vascular matrix constituents in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue sections were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protease families were identified with specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasmin, active matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and active MMP-9 significantly reduced microvessel-associated collagen, laminin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> (HSPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vascular HSPG perlecan was more sensitive than collagen or laminin in the bioassay and in the ischemic core 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-hour and 7-day ischemic tissue samples significantly degraded matrix perlecan and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibitor studies confirmed that while active MMPs were generated, active cysteine proteases significantly degraded microvessel perlecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L were generated in the microvasculature and adjacent neurons or glial cells 2 hours after MCAO and decreased perlecan in the bioassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first direct evidence that active proteases are generated in ischemic cerebral tissues that are acutely responsible for vascular matrix degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Degradation of vascular perlecan, the most sensitive matrix component thus far identified, may be due to cathepsins B and L, generated very rapidly after MCAO </plain></SENT>
