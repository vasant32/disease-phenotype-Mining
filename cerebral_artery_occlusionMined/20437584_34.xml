<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in tissue repairing and regeneration in ischemic organs, including the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the cause of EPC migration and the function of EPCs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated the effects of EPCs on ischemic brain injury in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Circulating human EPCs were characterized with immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPCs (1 x 10(6)) were injected into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice after 1 hour of tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis and behavioral tests were performed from day 0 to 28 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EPCs were detected in ischemic brain regions 24 hours after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EPC transplantation significantly reduced ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 3 days after tMCAO compared with control animals (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 was expressed in the majority of EPCs, and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) induced EPC migration, which was blocked by pretreated EPCs with AMD3100 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 was upregulated in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with control animals, injecting AMD3100-pretreated EPCs resulted in a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 3 days after tMCAO, suggesting that SDF-1-mediated signaling was involved in EPC-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, EPC transplantation reduced mouse cortex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> 4 weeks after tMCAO and improved neurobehavioral outcomes (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EPC injection potently <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> in the peri-infarction area (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: We conclude that systemic delivery of EPCs protects the brain against ischemic injury, promotes neurovascular repair, and improves long-term neurobehavioral outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that SDF-1-mediated signaling plays a critical role in EPC-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
