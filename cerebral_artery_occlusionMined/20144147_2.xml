<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether the changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels are predictive of the degree of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels measured by (1)H-MRS and neuronal cell damage in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was used to evaluate focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After MCAO for 90 min T2-weighted images (T2WIs), diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), and (1)H-MRS data were obtained from brains immediately, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured in T2WIs obtained 4 weeks after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of neuronal damage was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in three rats from each group at the same time as brain images were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> (Cr)-normalized <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels ([Lac+Lip]/Cr) were negatively correlated with Cr-normalized N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29993">L-aspartate</z:chebi> levels (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr) and positively correlated with TUNEL-positive cell numbers up to 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(Lac+Lip)/Cr at 6 hours and 9 hours was significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr at 7 days, but there was no significant correlation between (Lac+Lip)/Cr during the first 24 hours and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Up to 24 hours after reperfusion, (Lac+Lip)/Cr was strongly negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr, and was a good predictor of neuronal damage at 7 days; however, it was not predictive of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
