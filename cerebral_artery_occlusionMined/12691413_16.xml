<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> is an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">antiinflammatory drug</z:chebi> that disrupts leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions by limiting expression of endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules such as intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), also known as CD54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> could reduce the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> associated with transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by inhibition of ICAM-1 expression, and they evaluated its effects in rats treated with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> treatment was compared with mild systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, which is known to be neuroprotective and is commonly used during neurosurgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The maximum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> dose (240 mg/kg/day) that could be tolerated with no systemic toxicity was established in the initial experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the efficacy experiment, rats were pretreated with vehicle, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) prior to 2 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; then their brains were harvested at 24 hours of reperfusion for histological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine autoradiography in additional cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of ICAM-1 within ischemic compared with nonischemic caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum) or cortex was evaluated using immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle treatment, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> produced a 46.2% reduction (p = 0.01) in striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which was comparable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (48.7% reduction, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> did not alter end-ischemic CBF in any region studied, and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> treatment group had the lowest proportion of animals with marked ICAM-1 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> given in maximum tolerated doses reduces the striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective mechanism does not work through preservation of intraischemic CBF and is consistent with inhibition of ICAM-1 expression; however, at the doses used in this study, other effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> on platelet and endothelial function are possible </plain></SENT>
