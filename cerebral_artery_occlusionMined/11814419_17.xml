<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO) model was produced using the intraluminal filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of occlusion, 24 h of reperfusion, brains were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three atmospheres absolute HBO for 1 h was administered at 6 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evaluated by 2,3,7-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 mRNA expression was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and COX-2 protein expression was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HBO applied at 6 h after reperfusion significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as compared with no-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HBO decreased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels, which were upregulated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HBO had no direct effect on COX-2 protein expression in matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) early intervention with HBO within 6 h reduces infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) The neuroprotective effect of HBO might lead to an inhibition of COX-2 over-expression in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
