<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work in our laboratory has provided evidence that preadministration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> at subthreshold levels for neuroprotection enhanced the neuroprotective capacity when injected in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present investigation was designed to determine whether a co-drug consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> functional groups bound by a covalent bond, named UPEI-100, is capable of similar efficacy using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male rats were anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg iv), and the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 6 h or allowed to reperfuse for 5.5 h following a 30-min occlusion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preadministration of UPEI-100 dose-dependently decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the I/R model (P &lt; 0.05), but not in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the optimal dose, we then injected UPEI-100 during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or at several time points during reperfusion, and significant neuroprotection was observed when UPEI-100 was administered up to 90 min following the start of reperfusion (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time course for this neuroprotective effect showed that UPEI-100 resulted in a decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following 2 h of reperfusion compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time course of this neuroprotective effect was also used to study several mediators along the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> pathway and showed that UPEI-100 increased the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and decreased a marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (HNE-His adduct formation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data suggest that UPEI-100 may utilize similar pathways to those observed for the two parent compounds; however, it may also act through a different mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
