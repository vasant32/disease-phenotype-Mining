<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of BOLD-based reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2') MRI in detecting ischemic penumbra (IP) in a monkey model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and time evolution of relative R2' (rR2') in infarcted core, IP, and oligemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6 monkeys were used to make MCAO by the microcatheter method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans were performed at 0 h (1 h after MCAO), 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R2' was calculated using quantitative T2 and T2* maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic area was subdivided into infracted core, IP and oligemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rR2' was calculated respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reversible MCAO model for 4/6 monkeys was made successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rR2' values were significantly different at each time point, being highest in oligemia followed by IP and infarcted core (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With reperfusion time evolution, rR2' in infarcted core showed a decreased trend: sharply decreased within 6 hours and maintained at 0 during 6-48 hours (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rR2' values in IP and oligemia showed similar increased trend: sharply increased within 6 hours, maintained a plateau during 6-24 hours, and slightly increased until 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BOLD-based R2' MRI can be used to describe changes of cerebral oxygen extract in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and it can provide additional information in detecting IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The time evolution rR2' in infarcted core, IP, and oligemia is in accordance with the underlying pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
