<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the microvascular matrix (ECM), which participates in microvascular integrity, is degraded and lost when neurons are injured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of microvascular basal lamina antigens coincides with rapid expression of select matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen activators (PAs) may also play a role in ECM degradation by the generation of plasmin or by MMP activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The endogenous expressions of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase (uPA), and PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were quantified in 10-microm frozen sections from ischemic and matched nonischemic basal ganglia and in the plasma of 34 male healthy nonhuman primates before and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the ischemic basal ganglia, tissue uPA activity and antigen increased significantly within 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O (2P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>tPA activity transiently decreased 2 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O (2P=0.01) in concert with an increase in PAI-1 antigen (2P=0.001) but otherwise did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transient decrease in free tPA antigen was marked by an increase in the tPA-PAI-1 complex (2P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant relations to neuronal injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were discerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in endogenous PA activity is mainly due to significant increases in uPA, but not tPA, within the ischemic basal ganglia after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>:O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increase and an increase in PAI-1 coincided with latent MMP-2 generation and microvascular ECM degeneration but not neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
