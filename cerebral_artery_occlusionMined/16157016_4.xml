<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor increases intracellular cGMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of the PDE5 inhibitor on the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cGMP concentration, and infarction volume were measured in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), PDE5 inhibitor, zaprinast (10 mg/kg), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50868,7959">penicillamine</z:chebi> (SNAP, 100 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured continuously by laser-Doppler flowmetry in the ischemic penumbra of the ischemic and contralateral sides under continuous blood pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cGMP concentrations were determined using the enzyme immunoassay and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were estimated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The administration of zaprinast significantly increased rCBF in the ischemic brain compared with the pre-drug control value despite the decreased mean blood pressure, whereas it did not affect rCBF in the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cGMP concentration was significantly higher in the ischemic cortex compared with the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SNAP infusion increased the cGMP concentration in the bilateral cortices to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly decreased by zaprinast administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PDE5 inhibitor zaprinast may selectively increase CBF in the ischemic brain via increased cGMP levels, thus providing a new strategy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
