<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Membrane potential was evaluated based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> fluorescence in the mitochondria as detected using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with equivalent samples from the contralateral hemisphere, the geometric mean fluorescence was significantly lower in mitochondria prepared from the striatum and perifocal tissue in the cortex at 3 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, this property was decreased in mitochondria from tissue in the striatum and cortex that had been part of severely ischemic core tissue during the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings provide additional evidence that mitochondria develop changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion that are likely to limit their ability to respond to changing energy requirements and contribute to cell dysfunction and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also demonstrates the ability to gain a sensitive measure of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
