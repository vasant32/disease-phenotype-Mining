<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of inflammatory processes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> would be greatly beneficial in both designing individual therapeutic strategies and monitoring outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently developed a new approach to imaging components of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, namely endovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression on the brain endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show specific imaging of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (VCAM)-1 expression in a mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and a reduction in this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, associated with improved behavioral outcome, as a result of preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spatial extent of VCAM-1 expression is considerably greater than the detectable lesion using diffusion-weighted imaging (25% versus 3% total brain volume), which is generally taken to reflect the core of the lesion at early time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, VCAM-1 imaging seems to reveal both core and penumbral regions, and our data implicate VCAM-1 upregulation and associated inflammatory processes in the progression of penumbral tissue to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that such molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches could be important clinical tools for patient evaluation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> monitoring of therapy, and design of specific treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
