<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of brain injury is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defensive and offensive factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may play important roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, only individual factors were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>What are the relationships among them in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study is to investigate simultaneously the expression of PDGF-BB, 5-LO, AQP-4 and IGF-1 in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 5-LO and IGF-1 reached the peak level at 24h after reperfusion, AQP-4 at 72 h and PDGF-BB at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With these results we inferred that both defensive factors, such as PDGF-BB, AQP-4 and IGF-1, and offensive factor, like 5-LO, play some roles in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
