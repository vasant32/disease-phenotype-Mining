<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dexanabinol is a noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with anti-inflammatory effects and tempol is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored whether their combined use results in smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as compared with their individual administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) and were given vehicle, dexanabinol alone, tempol alone, or a combination of dexanabinol and tempol (n = 13 per group) 1 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five animals in each group were evaluated with a motor rating scale 24 h after PMCAO and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were then measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals were examined with motor and behavioral scales up to 30 days after PMCAO and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor disability and water maze latencies at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points examined and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at days 1 and 30 were significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active treatment groups when compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences were observed between the active treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, combination therapy with dexanabinol and tempol does not appear to have additional neuroprotective effects compared to those conferred by each agent alone even when administered at optimal timing and dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a ceiling neuroprotective effect that is impossible to overcome may exist </plain></SENT>
