<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with WIN at doses of 0.4 to 400 micrograms/kg 15 min, 3 hr and 6 hr after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O had significantly higher mean arterial blood pressure than saline controls (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O, WIN-treated rats had significantly greater recovery of EEG activity and higher neurological scores than the controls; these actions were greatest at a dose of 40 micrograms/kg (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome correlated with recovery of the ipsilateral EEG (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate 24 hr after occlusion and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were not significantly different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 hr after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O, there were no significant differences in regional concentrations of endogenous opioid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (dynorphin, Leu-enkephalin and beta-endorphin) between the injured and uninjured hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These are the first studies to evaluate the effects of an opiate <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> over a wide dose range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dose-related beneficial actions were found with regard to several, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of regional opioid changes after regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in contrast to previous studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> and brain trauma, was unexpected, but may reflect limited regional and temporal sampling </plain></SENT>
