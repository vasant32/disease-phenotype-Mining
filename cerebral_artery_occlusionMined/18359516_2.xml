<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, adult male Wistar rats subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 60 min were allocated to treatment of the anti-inflammatory compound alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi>) or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to evaluate the effects of alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI volumetry was performed to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and MRI measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were performed to evaluate changes in the extra/intracellular volume ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was used as a reference method to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area decreased significantly two days after MCAO in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume determined from the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map decreased in the alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> treated group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five days after MCAO, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> returned to baseline levels in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> group was smaller compared to the saline treated group as demonstrated both by MRI and TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study showed that the extra/intracellular ratio (reflected by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) following focal brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> could be affected by alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we showed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by alpha-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The volumetric dimensions of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas measured by MRI were comparable to those measured by histology </plain></SENT>
