<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and potential utility of intraoperative computed tomographic angiography (iCTA) in identifying unexpected residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 6 consecutive patients with ruptured anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent craniotomy and clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>iCTA was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after the surgeon was satisfied that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was completely obliterated and the clip did not occlude a major artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the iCTA images with regard to residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and compared them with the postoperatively acquired angiographic images, which served as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient age and sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location and size, clinical presentation after rupture, and postoperative course, as well as postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores, were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the 6 patients had a residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> detected on the iCTA images, and it was confirmed on the immediate postoperative digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> on iCTA imaging or postoperatively acquired angiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: iCTA is both feasible and potentially useful in identifying unexpected residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> after surgical clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
