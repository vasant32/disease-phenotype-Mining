<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young adult rats were subjected to 60-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under either normothermia (37.5 degrees C) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging was used to monitor changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> throughout the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33377">dysprosium</z:chebi> contrast was used at the end of the ischemic period to verify that the occlusion was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C-fos and hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were examined with in situ hybridization at the end of the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the size of the region that exhibited reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was smaller during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> than during normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> also decreased the frequency of occurrence of transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reductions, especially in dorsal aspects of cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of both c-fos and hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were markedly reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction and c-fos expression are associated with spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, which is believed to contribute to lesion expansion during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that part of the neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may be due to a reduced incidence of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
