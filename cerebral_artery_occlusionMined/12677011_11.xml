<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to examine baseline factors to determine predictors of good outcome and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected from the baseline clinical, radiologic, and angiographic data variables that considered possibly related to outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A univariate analysis was performed to examine the association between these baseline factors and good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score &lt;or=2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model then selected the most important variables independently influencing prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A risk score for each patient was constructed on the basis of the patient's individual values for each independent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into risk quartiles based on their risk scores, and an odds ratio for each risk quartile was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment effects of each quartile were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, screening National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) score and age were strongly associated with good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate model selected age, NIHSS score, and CT hypodensity as the most important prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dividing patients into quartiles based on risk scores achieved a uniform gradient of probability of good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A trend toward benefit of r-proUK treatment was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk quartiles, and no differential treatment effect was observed across risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of differential effect of r-proUK across subgroups of patients stratified by risk </plain></SENT>
