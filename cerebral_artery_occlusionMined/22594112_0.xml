<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the randomized and controlled principle 1384 rats were divided into the basic control group (including the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham, model control, model without intervention, Nimodipine, and para-Renzhong groups) and the acupuncture group (including the Neiguan (PC 6), Weizhong (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 40), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Chize (LU 5), Renzhong (GV 6) and non-acupoint groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was modeled by Zea-longa's thread ligation and rats with scores of 1-3, as assessed by Zausinger's six-point method, were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the acupuncture group each acupoint was set with 12 different parameters by the orthogonal intersection method, resulting in 78 groups with 18 rats per group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were treated by acupuncture once every 12 h for a total of six sessions and neurobehavioral scores were measured after each session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurobehavioral scores were compared by one-way ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS 17.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After acupuncture therapy the mean neurobehavioral scores in MCAO rats increased gradually at each time point with a significant difference among the six scores, but with no significant differences between the fourth (48 h) and the fifth score (60 h), and between the fifth (60 h) and the sixth (72 h) score (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MCAO rats gradually recovered movement function over multiple acupuncture sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the fouth acupuncture session (48 h), the neurobehavioral scores of rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture treatment had a reliable curative effect on movement function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> rats </plain></SENT>
