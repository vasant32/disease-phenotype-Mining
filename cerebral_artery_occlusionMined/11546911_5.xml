<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to investigate the effects of EPC-K1, a free radical scavenger, on reducing <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in a rabbit model of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) photothrombosis and to investigate whether the combination of EPC-K1 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> enhances neuroprotection from cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-alone group (n=8), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered intravenously for 24 hours, starting from 3 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the EPC-K1-alone group (n=8), EPC-K1 was administered as a bolus injection (10 mg/kg) twice at 3 and 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the combination group (n=8), EPC-K1 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> both were administered as in the single-drug procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle group (n=10), saline were infused for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> by approximately 3 times that of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-treated animals, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> size was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001) and neurological symptoms were significantly worse (P&lt;0.01) than in control animals at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of EPC-K1 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dramatically reduced <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001), with a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (reduction by 63.2% and 57.2% of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-alone and control animals, respectively, P&lt;0.0001) and a significant improvement in neurological symptoms (P&lt;0.01 versus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-alone and control animals, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that free radical formation may play a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> exacerbated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment and that the combination of a free radical scavenger and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> augmented neuroprotection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study may suggest a potential clinical approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
