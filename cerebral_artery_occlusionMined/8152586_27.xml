<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the chemokine alpha superfamily, most of which have neutrophil chemotactic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since brain chemokines may play a significant role in neutrophil accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> which can contribute to the extent of tissue injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we examined the expression of CINC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant CINC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed in the ipsilateral (ischemic) cortex from 6 h (17.3 +/- 3.7%, n = 6, P &lt; 0.05) to 24 h (32.1 +/- 3.7%, n = 5, P &lt; 0.01) with a peak at 12 h (43.9 +/- 3.7%, n = 6, P &lt; 0.01) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five days post-MCAO, CINC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were no longer elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant CINC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed in the contralateral (control) cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that message for the neutrophil chemoattractant CINC is induced early in brain tissue subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and therefore supports the possibility that brain-derived chemokines support the infiltration of circulating inflammatory cells following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
