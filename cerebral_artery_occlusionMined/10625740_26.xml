<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) that occur in ischemic boundary zones of the cerebral cortex of experimental animals have been shown to promote rather than simply to indicate the evolution of the lesion and are especially prominent in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the influence of one factor, species, on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> incidence, we compared the frequency of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> in a primate species, the squirrel monkey, with that in the cat after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reviewed as a possible cause of interexperiment variability in the cat experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In open-skull experiments under chloralose anesthesia, changes in cortical fluorescence believed to indicate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15846">NAD(+)</z:chebi> redox state, as markers of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>, were recorded by serial imaging of the cortical surface in vivo for 4 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fluorescence transients occurred in squirrel monkeys at a frequency (mean+/-SD) of 0.7+/-0.8 hours(-1) (n=5), which was not significantly less than in that observed in cats (1.3+/-1.6 hours(-1), n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from the cat experiments indicated a relationship between number of transients (dependent) and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, with a striking increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> frequency in association with values of mean postocclusion plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;4.1 mmol/L (Mann-Whitney U=15.0, P=0.034); this observation agrees well with other published findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transient changes in fluorescence strongly suggestive of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations, either transient or terminal, occur and propagate in the ischemic cerebral cortex of a nonhuman primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that the relationship of frequency of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> requires further examination, to confirm the finding and to determine a safe lower limit for a target range for control of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> if insulin is used in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
