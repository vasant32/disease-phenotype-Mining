<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>]) increases gradually and incessantly during the initial hours of experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> but only in severely damaged brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose that this steady increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>] can be used to estimate the time after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with bilateral common <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 100 to 450 minutes, diffusion-weighted MRI was used to generate apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined with (14)C-iodoantipyrine (in a subset of 7 animals), and the brain was frozen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic CBF sections and punch samples for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> analysis were obtained from the brain at the same level of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severely at risk regions were identified with an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of &lt;520 microm(2)/s and, in the subset, with both <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of &lt;520 microm(2)/s and CBF of &lt;40 mL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both CBF and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> dropped quickly and remained stable in the initial hours after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linear regression revealed strong linearity between [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>] and time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, with a slope of 0.95 or 1.00 (mEq/kg DW)/min, with both <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-plus-CBF criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 95% CIs at 180 and 360 minutes were between 41 and 52 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The time after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> can be estimated with this 2-step process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>First, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF are used to identify severely endangered regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Second, the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>] in these regions is used to estimate time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The favorable 95% CIs at the time limits for thrombolytic therapy and the availability of measurements of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, CBF, and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>] in humans through the use of MRI suggest that this time-estimation scheme could be used to assess the appropriateness of thrombolysis for patients who do not know when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
