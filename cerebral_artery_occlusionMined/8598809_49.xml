<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> caudate-putamen (CP), 869 +/- 145 ms and 72 +/- 2 ms for T1 and for T2, respectively, were found; the corresponding values for cortex were 928 +/- 117 ms and 73 +/- 2 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> showed significant dependence on gradient direction: diffusion along x resulted in 534 +/- 53 microns 2/s (CP) and 554 +/- 62 microns 2/s (cortex), and along y in 697 +/- 58 microns 2/s (CP) and 675 +/- 53 microns 2/s (cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic territory, a continuous increase over time of both relaxation times was observed in the CP, leading to an increase of 29 +/- 20% (T1) and 51 +/- 41% (T2) above control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> dropped to 63 +/- 15% of control in the CP and to 74 +/- 4% of control in the temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant change was noted in proton density during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strongest <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction was in the center of the ischemic territory (&lt; or = 60% of control) surrounded by a region of lesser reduction (&lt; or = 80% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the early part of the study, the area of reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was larger than that of elevated relaxation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toward the end of the experiment, the area of increased relaxation times approached that of decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> at &lt; or = 80% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good agreement of histological presentation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with the total area of decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (&lt; or = 80%) was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
