<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a novel therapeutic for AD, a transducible humanin with an extended caspase-3 cleavage sequence (tHN-C3), was developed and showed multiple mechanisms of therapeutic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included targeted delivery of anti-apoptotic protein humanin through the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) to neuronal cells, specific inhibition of caspase-3 activation to inhibit the early triggering of AD progression, and delivery of humanin into the cytoplasm of neuronal cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> where it exerts its anti-apoptotic functions effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tHN-C3 prevented neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>, or soluble AÎ²(42), via Bax binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In animal models of AD induced by amyloid beta, in Tg2576 mice, and in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, tHN-C3 effectively prevented neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, inflammatory cell infiltration into the brain, and improved cognitive memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effectiveness of tHN-C3 was comparable to that of Aricept, a clinically approved drug for AD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, tHN-C3 may be a new remedy with multiple therapeutic functions targeting the early and late stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in AD and other brain injuries </plain></SENT>
