<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of cell-swelling-activated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channels, including the antiestrogenic compound <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (TAM), have been shown to attenuate the increase in excitatory amino acids (EAA) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since TAM enters the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> we tested whether it provides protection from damage due to reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TAM (5 mg/kg, i.v.) infused 25 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, potently reduced the total volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> from 328 +/- 34 mm3 to 41 +/- 21 mm3, a reduction of 87%, as measured by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was equally effective when infused starting at 1 h after reperfusion, i.e. 3 h after initiation of rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protection of neurons was also found histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAM had no effect on CBF as measured by hydrogen clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This appears to be the first report of a marked neuroprotective effect of TAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether its effects are due to inhibition of EAA release and/or other potential neuroprotective sites of action </plain></SENT>
