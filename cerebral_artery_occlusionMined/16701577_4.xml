<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to neurotoxic effect in ischemic brain, inducible NOS (iNOS) also adversely affect ischemic outcome by blocking neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, therefore, we studied the chronological and spatial change of the distribution of iNOS and cell proliferation in subventricular zone (SVZ) after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO), iNOS-positive cells decreased in the ischemic core at 1 to 21 days, and increased in the ipsilateral periischemic area at 1 and 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells appeared in the ischemic core at 3 to 21 days, appeared in the periischemic area at 3 and 7 days, and increased in the ipsilateral SVZ at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ED-1-positive cells appeared in the ischemic core at 3 to 21 days, and some of them were double positive with BrdU or iNOS, but the majority were BrdU-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that astrocytes are born within the periischemic area at early stage after tMCAO and migrate from SVZ into periischemic area at later stage, and that time-dependent and spatial changes of iNOS expression may be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of adult neurogenesis after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
