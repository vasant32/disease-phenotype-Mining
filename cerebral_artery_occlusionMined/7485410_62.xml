<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of ischemic injury to the myocardium and other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we asked whether inhibiting the effects of IL-1 would affect the outcome of an experimental brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats (n = 13) with permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery were given IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group (n = 13) with the same type of brain injury was given a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third group, subjected to a sham operation, was given either IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (n = 2) or a placebo (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated after either 24 hours or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, animals treated with IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> improved their neurological score (P &lt; 0.05), experienced less pronounced changes in body weight (P &lt; 0.05), and had fewer necrotic neurons (P &lt; 0.001) and fewer leukocytes in the ischemic hemisphere (P &lt; 0.001) as well as a smaller area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) in the ischemis hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that inhibiting the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 with a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> is an effective way of influencing the leukocyte responses elicited by an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such leukocyte inhibition seemingly attenuates the number of necrotic neurons resulting from the occlusion of a large brain artery </plain></SENT>
