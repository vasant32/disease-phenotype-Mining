<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) are administered intravenously after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, they reliably produce behavioral and anatomical recovery, and protect neural tissue from progressive change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, our results indicate that the cells do not exert their effects by engraftment in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, even though they migrate to the site of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine if the cells induce recovery by decreasing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies to show that HUCBCs decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and thereby enhance neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and transplantation, there was a decrease in CD45/CD11b- and CD45/B220-positive (+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This decrease was accompanied by a decrease in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity in the brain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals treated with HUCBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to modulating the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, we demonstrate that the cord blood cells increase neuronal survival through non-immune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once thought of as "cell replacement therapy," we now propose that cord blood treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and provides neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both of these components are necessary for effective therapy </plain></SENT>
