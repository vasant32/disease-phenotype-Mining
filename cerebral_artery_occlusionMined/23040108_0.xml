<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that RA has protective effects against damage caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> or oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in mesangial and PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 9-cis-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (9cRA) reduced infarction and TUNEL labeling in cerebral cortex as well as attenuated neurological deficits after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine a protective role of 9cRA in dopaminergic (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) neurons in a typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protective role of 9cRA was first examined in rat primary ventromesencephalic culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and TUNEL labeling in cultured dopaminergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was also examined in adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals received unilateral 6-OHDA lesioning at the left medial forebrain bundle on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">Methamphetamine</z:chebi> -induced rotational behavior was examined on days 6, 20 and 30 after lesioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were separated into 2 groups to balance rotational behavior and lesion extent on day 6 and were treated with either 9cRA or vehicle (i.c.v. on day 7 + intra-nasal from day 8 to day 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> -mediated ipislateral rotation at 20 and 30 days after lesioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vivo voltammetry was used to examine <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> overflow in striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 9cRA significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> -evoked <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> release in the lesioned striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9cRA also increased tyrosine hydroxylase (+) cell number in the lesioned nigra as determined by unbiased stereology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that early post-treatment with 9cRA has a protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in nigrostriatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> neurons in an animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
