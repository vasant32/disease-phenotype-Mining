<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several proteins are known to be markedly expressed in the brain during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; however, the changes in protein profiles within the ischemic brain after an ischemic insult have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the changes in the ischemic brain proteome after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LCMS-IT-TOF mass spectrometry was used to detect the changes in ischemic brain protein patterns after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the protein expression detected in the ischemic area, by western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine unique proteins were identified from the ischemic area at 10 h after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these proteins, we focused on Rab33b, a member of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> oncogene family and we found that Rab33b was up-regulated in the ischemic striatum and the number of Rab33B-positive cells increased in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rab33B colocalized with Iba-1 positive microglia in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that LCMS-IT-TOF is useful for identifying changes in proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that Rab33B is partially related to the pathogenesis of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
