<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent cellular reaction to this type of damage has been found to be trophic or proliferative changes in glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined dynamic changes in glial cells adjacent to the infarcted tissue in response to oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that astrocyte proliferation was seen more at 3 than at 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, while their numbers with and without oxygenation were almost the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of microglia, however, was seen more with than without oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, microglia seem to be able to secrete an angiogenetic factor under hypoxic conditions, and are active in terms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow is directly related to tissue oxygen content and its autoregulatory capacity has been found to be greater as the volume contracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, we suggest that the application of oxygen-treated microglia to ischaemic tissue could diminish tissue damage, and that the most effective oxygenation can be achieved by the withdrawal of blood and reduction of the intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
