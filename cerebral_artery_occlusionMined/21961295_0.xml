<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32988">amides</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and glycine (CrGlyOEt), phenylalanine (CrPheNH2), thyrosine (CrTyrNH2), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> (CrGABAOEt) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain injury was evaluated on day 2 after transient MCAO using a TTC staining of brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the MCAO control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CrAms showed decreased cerebral injury (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However CrPheNH2, CrTyrNH2, and CrGABAOEt were toxic after intravenous administration and investigated only after intraperitoneal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CrGlyOEt did not show any toxicity at dose of 1 mmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data evidenced that creatinyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32988">amides</z:chebi> can represent promising candidates for the development of new drugs useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
