<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain injury is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, leading to accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokines influence the recruitment of leucocytes and play a key role in the inflammatory injury processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated a close relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a newly identified T-cell-specific cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the source and the action of IL-17 over the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats (Sprague-Dawley) and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-17 in the ischemic hemisphere of the human brain, which was removed at necropsy, were assayed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) was obtained by inserting nylon monofilament into the right external carotid artery, occluding the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-17 mRNA in rat was assayed using oligoprobe in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-17 production by neuroglial cells was assayed by double-staining using antibody glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and antibody IL-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-17 were elevated in the ischemic hemispheres of human brain compared with the opposite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemispheres and peaked at days 3-5 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The IL-17-positive cells were found in the ischemic lesion region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IL-17 mRNA was also elevated in ischemic hemispheres of pMCAO-operated rats, which were slightly elevated after 1 h and peaked at 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IL-17 and GFAP double-stained were extensive in rat ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced IL-17 expression in human brain reported here for the first time was very similar to that in rat model except that the peak was slightly earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found for the first time that IL-17 was involved in an intense inflammatory reaction of brain ischemic injury in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In pMCAO-operated rats, our findings suggest that IL-17 is produced by the neuroglial cells in the brain region undergoing ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in additional to T cells the neuroglial cell may be another cellular origin of IL-17 in later progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
