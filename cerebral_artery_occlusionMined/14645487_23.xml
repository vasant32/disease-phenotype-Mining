<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine whether we could produce occlusions in older rats with an acceptable mortality rate and then detect reliable, long-lasting functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reversible intraluminar suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) procedure was used to produce small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in middle-aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an acceptable mortality rate, and robust disabilities were detected in functional assays, although the degree of total tissue loss measured 90 d after MCAO was quite modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarcted animals were functionally impaired relative to sham control animals even 90 d after the occlusions, and when animals were subgrouped based on amount of tissue loss, MCAO animals with only 4% tissue loss exhibited enduring neurological-behavioral impairments relative to sham-operated controls, and the functional impairments in the group with the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (20% tissue loss) were more severe than the functional impairments in the rats with 4% tissue loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this model, using reversible MCAO to produce small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and long-lasting functional-behavioral deficits in older rats, may represent an advance in the relatively higher-throughput modeling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its recovery in rodents and may be useful in the development and characterization of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
