<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine (i) whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is able to increase ischemic brain damage in mutant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD2) mice and (ii) whether the reduction of SOD2 activity has a profound effect on HIF-1 protein expression under hyperglycemic ischemic condition </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the HIF-1alpha protein levels were not significantly decreased in hyperglycemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> animals subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the increased brain damage observed in hyperglycemic SOD2(-/+) mice is associated with HIF-1alpha suppression, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se does not seem to exert its detrimental effects on ischemic brain via modulating HIF-1 pathway </plain></SENT>
