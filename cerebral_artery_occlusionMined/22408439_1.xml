<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">Carnitine</z:chebi> plays important roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism and in modulating the ratio of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> (CoA)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the neuroprotective effects of l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (LC) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">Acetyl</z:chebi>-l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (ALC) pre-treatment on ischemic insults under the same experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model to evaluate the protective roles of LC and ALC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo and to understand the possible mechanisms using model of PC12 cell cultures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that ALC, but not LC, decreased infarction size in SD rats after MCAO in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, both LC and ALC pretreatment reduced oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced cell injury and decreased OGD-induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro; at the same time, both of them increased the activities of super <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and ATPase, and decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggested that LC and ALC pre-treatment are highly effective in the prevention of neuronal cell against ischemic injury in vitro, however, only ALC has the protective effect on neuronal cell injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
