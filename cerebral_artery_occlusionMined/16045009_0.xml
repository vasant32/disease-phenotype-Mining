<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided randomly into 4 groups: sham-operated group and MCAO and reperfusion model groups which were randomly divided into control group, saline group, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> aescinate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry staining and microscope image were used to observe the dynamic Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 protein expression in the ischemic penumbra after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bcl-2 protein expression in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> aescinate group was significantly higher than that of the saline group and control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While Caspase-3 protein expression in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> aescinate group was then compared with those of the saline group and control group, and showed the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the saline group and control group, the number of apoptotic cells in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> aescinate group was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> aescinate increases Bcl-2 protein expression and decreases Caspase-3 protein expression,through which it can protect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> brain on reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
