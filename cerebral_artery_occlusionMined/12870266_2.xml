<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased ApoE immunoreactivity was recognized in astrocytes 3-14 days after MCAO in the affected side of cortex, and in neurons 4-14 days after MCAO in the same area </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in astrocytes and macrophages, but not in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that neuronal ApoE was not synthesized in neurons, but derived from astrocytes </plain></SENT>
