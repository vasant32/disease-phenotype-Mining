<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and brains were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteins that were differentially expressed after EGb 761 treatment during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein spots with more than a 2.5-fold change in intensity between vehicle- and EGb 761-treated groups were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of peroxiredoxin-2 and protein phosphatase 2A subunit B were significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated group in comparison to the EGb 761-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of the collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) were significantly increased in vehicle-treated animals, while EGb 761 prevented the injury-induced increase of CRMP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EGb 761 protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain injury through the specific up- and down-modulation of various proteins </plain></SENT>
