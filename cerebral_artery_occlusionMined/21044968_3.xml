<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a natural response to injury and disease, neutrophils activate, adhere to the microvasculature, migrate into brain tissue, and release toxic substances such as reactive oxygen species and proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This neutrophil response occurs when blood flow is returned to brain tissue (reperfusion) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of activated systemic neutrophils increases the potential for tissue injury during reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although experiments in rat models suggest that activated neutrophils play a pivotal role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury, little is known about systemic neutrophil activation during reperfusion following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize systemic leukocyte responses and neutrophil CD11b expression 15-min and 24-hr post-reperfusion in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal filament method of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) with reperfusion or a sham procedure was performed in male C57Bl/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated leukocyte counts and manual white blood cell (WBC) differential counts were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to assess systemic neutrophil surface CD11b expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the damaging potential of systemic neutrophil activation begins as early as 15 min and remains evident at 24 hr after the initiation of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, because transgenic mouse models, bred on a C57Bl/6 background, are increasingly used to elucidate single mechanisms of reperfusion injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, findings from this study are foundational for future investigations examining the damaging potential of neutrophil responses post-reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in genetically altered mouse models within this background strain </plain></SENT>
