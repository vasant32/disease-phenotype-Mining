<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that this Zn(2+) is released upon the excitation of nerves in vitro, there has been little study of the release of Zn(2+) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using brain microdialysis, the release of vesicular Zn(2+) was investigated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the vesicular Zn(2+) was released into the synaptic cleft by a depolarizing stimulation achieved by perfusion with Ringer's solution containing high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (100mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>), a significant increase in the extracellular concentration of Zn(2+) could be detected by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, we investigated the release of vesicular Zn(2+) in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model using microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the extracellular Zn(2+) level in the cortex increased within 15 min of the start of occlusion and reached a peak at 30 min, which was about twice the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 30 min, it declined with time returning to the basal level 15 min after reperfusion, which was performed after 60 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that vesicular Zn(2+) would be released into the synaptic cleft during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
