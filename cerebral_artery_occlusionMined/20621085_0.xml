<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maximum vasoconstrictions (E(max)) caused by 120mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in endothelium-denuded ring preparations were measured in ischemic and control cerebral arteries of rats after a 1-h right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 0-min (I/NR) or 2-3-min (I/SR) reperfusion, and in peripheral arteries after I/SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, vasoconstrictions to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and 120mmol/lK(+) were attenuated in remote brain vessels after I/SR, i.e. in the contralateral middle cerebral artery and the basilar artery, while I/NR depressed E(max) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> only in the ischemic middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with N-(2-mercaptopropionyl) glycine (MPG, 100mg/kg i.p.), a free radical scavenger, fully prevented the impairment of vasomotor function in the middle cerebral artery on both sides after I/SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, vasomotor functions were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the coronary, renal and pulmonary arteries after I/SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion impaired vasoconstrictor responses in remote brain arteries of rats by a mechanism involving free radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of similar effects in peripheral vessels indicates poor defence of brain arteries against remote injury caused by reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
