<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the volume of infarcted tissue as defined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was determined in rabbits at 28 h, 7 days, and 3 weeks after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to values at 28 h, infarcted tissue volume did not change at 7 days after occlusion, but decreased significantly by three weeks after occlusion (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarcted tissue volume expressed as a percent of hemispheric volume did not significantly change at either timepoint (p &lt; 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicated that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume changes were not due to glial infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total hemispheric volume decreased by 7 days (p &lt; 0.01) and 3 weeks (p &lt; 0.01) after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that changes in hemispheric volume may confound comparison of injury volumes in animals at differing times after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In experiments where drug treatments increase survival after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, comparisons of the absolute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume may not be valid if drug-treated animals survive greater than 1 week and untreated animals do not </plain></SENT>
