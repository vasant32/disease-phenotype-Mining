<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chlormethiazole (1 mmol/kg i.p.) or saline was administered 60 min after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and the animals sacrificed after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cross sectional area of the left hemisphere was increased by 21.8 + 1.9% in saline treated rats, but only by 8.4 + 2.4% in chlormethiazole treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the reduction in the absolute area of neurodegenerative damage (mm2) following chlormethiazole administration was considerably greater than the reduction in hemispheric swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical tissue water content of ischaemic brain increased from 76.4% to 84.2% and this was attenuated to 78.8% by chlormethiazole administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that, providing damage is measured by fitting tissue slices onto prematched stereotactic maps, the decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> which accompanies a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> does not result in erroneous estimates of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
