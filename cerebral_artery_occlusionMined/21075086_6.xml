<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BI-1's cytoprotective activity is manifested in the context of ER stress, with previous studies showing that BI-1 modulates several ER-associated functions, including Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the role of BI-1 in neuroprotection by generating transgenic mice in which BI-1 was constitutively expressed from a neuronal-specific promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultured primary cortical neurons from BI-1 transgenic mouse embryos exhibited greater resistance to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by agents known to cause ER stress compared to their non-transgenic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and vasculature of BI-1 mice appeared to be unchanged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-transgenic mice, BI-1 transgenic mice showed reduced brain lesion volumes and better performance in motoric tests, compared with non-transgenic littermates, in two models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by controlled cortical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, brain tissue from BI-1 transgenic mice showed reduced levels of apoptotic cells and reduced induction of markers of ER stress after brain injury, including CHOP protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, our findings demonstrate that enforced neuronal expression of BI-1 reduces ER stress and provides protection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury, suggesting that strategies for enhancing BI-1 expression or activity should be considered for development of new therapies for counteracting the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain trauma </plain></SENT>
