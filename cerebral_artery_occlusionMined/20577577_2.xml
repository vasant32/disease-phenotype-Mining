<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to limited penetration of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, many therapeutic agents in clinical use require higher doses in order to reach effective concentrations in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some instances, these high doses elicit severe side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the case of erythropoietin (EPO), an established neuroprotectant against ischemic brain injury, its low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability requires such a high therapeutic dose that it can induce dangerous complications such as polycythmia and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to generate a modified EPO that has increased facility crossing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> without losing its neuroprotective element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have engineered a fusion protein (EPO-TAT) by tagging a protein transduction domain derived from HIV TAT to the EPO protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This sequence enhanced the capacity of EPO to cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in animals at least twofold when IP administered and up to five-fold when IV administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments showed that this EPO fusion protein retained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> its protective properties against neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> elicited by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The needed therapeutic dose of the EPO-TAT was decreased by ~10-fold compared to that of regular EPO to achieve equivalent neuroprotection in terms of reducing volume of infarction induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the approach of using a protein transduction domain coupled to therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this way, not only can the therapeutic doses be lowered, but agents without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability may now be available for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
