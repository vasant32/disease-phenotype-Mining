<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work was designed to study the antiischemic effects of scutellarin and its mixture with another substance, breviscapine, in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ligature of left anterior descending arteries was performed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), and the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was created to induce focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MI size was significantly reduced by scutellarin (15 and 50 mg/kg) but not by breviscapine (5 to 50 mg/kg); the effect of scutellarin on the anti-MI was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, scutellarin (50 mg/kg) reduced the myocardium cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two drugs together (5 to 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarction size in focal brain ischemic rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the 3 dosages in breviscapine-treated rats, and the effect of scutellarin on the anticerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the protective effects of scutellarin on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were better than its mixture, breviscapine, in rats </plain></SENT>
