<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 2 models of severe ischemic injury, we have evaluated the neuroprotective action of D-JNKI1, a cell-penetrating and protease-resistant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> selectively inhibiting the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hippocampal slices from newborn rats were subjected to oxygen (5%) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1 mmol/L) deprivation for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>, and the evoked potential responses were recorded in the CA1 region after stimulation in CA3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male ICR-CD1 mice were subjected to permanent endoluminal "suture" middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion size was determined after 24 hours by triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, and neurological scores and rotarod treadmill performance were used to evaluate the neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, D-JNKI administration 6 hours after oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 24 hours from 21%+/-8% (n=10) to 5%+/-3% (n=7, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protective effect was still seen at 48 hours, paralleled by an improved amplitude of the evoked potential response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo in the mouse, D-JNKI1 administration 3 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 162+/-27 mm(3) (n=14) to 85+/-27 mm(3) (n=9, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: JNK inhibition prevents cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in hippocampal slice cultures in vitro and by permanent suture MCAo in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>D-JNKI1 is a powerful neuroprotectant in models of both mild and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, with an extended therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are needed to identify the relevant JNK target(s) mediating ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
