<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several Golgi studies have argued for de novo growth and branching of dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the spared hemisphere, but the results could not always be replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional brain imaging studies in humans and rodents suggest that significant neuronal plasticity occurs in areas surrounding the cortical lesion, but whether dendritic rearrangements occur there has been less well studied, especially after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used in vivo two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy in adult mice expressing green fluorescent protein to monitor longitudinally the length and branch complexity of entire apical dendritic arbors from layer 5 pyramidal neurons distributed over a large peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex region after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find no evidence of growth of dendrites or addition of new branches to their arbors over a period of 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, we observed a two-step pruning process: an initial decrease in dendritic length, followed by a loss of dendritic branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the shortening of branch tips reflected a general shrinkage in the dendritic apical tree, suggesting that mechanical forces attributable to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> contributed to the changes in dendritic length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results help resolve a long-standing debate regarding the role of large-scale dendritic plasticity of pyramidal neurons in functional recovery after cortical injury </plain></SENT>
