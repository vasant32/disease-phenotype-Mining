<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy six Wistar rats were divided randomly into middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group and MCAO plus cerebral lymphatic blockade (MCAO+CLB) group for the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contents of water and electrolytes, the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in the ischemic brain tissue were detected at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morphologic examination was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In MCAO group, contents of water, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium in the ischemic brain tissue increased significantly at any time after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SOD activity decreased while the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content increased markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphologic findings showed severe damage of ischemic brain tissue and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MCAO+CLB group, the above parameters were altered more obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present observation suggests that blockade of cerebral lymphatic drainage may deteriorate ischemic brain damage after MCAO </plain></SENT>
