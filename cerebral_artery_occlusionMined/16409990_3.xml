<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many transcripts were induced in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, including genes associated with transcriptional pathways, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, stress responses and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, EASE analysis of the regulated genes indicated molecular functions and biological processes unique to each model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathways associated with tMCAO included <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle, while pMCAO was associated with the induction of genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, growth factors and signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An intriguing finding was the involvement of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following tMCAO and pMCAO involves distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings may give new insight to the molecular mechanisms involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may lead to novel neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
