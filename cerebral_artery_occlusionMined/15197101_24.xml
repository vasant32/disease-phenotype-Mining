<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Massive production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> results in continuous formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> even several hours after IR insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This can produce DNA strand nicks, hydroxylation and/or nitration of cytosolic components of neuron, leading to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrite</z:chebi> decomposition catalysts 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4'-pyridyl)porphyrinato iron (III) (FeTMPyP) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron (III) (FeTPPS) have been demonstrated to protect neurons in in vitro cultures; however, their neuroprotective efficacy in cerebral IR injury has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and the therapeutic time window of FeTMPyP and FeTPPS in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (FCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FCI was induced according to the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of MCAO and 70 h of reperfusion, the extent of neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume were measured in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FeTMPyP and FeTPPS were administered at different time points 2, 6, 9 and 12 h post MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FeTMPyP and FeTPPS (3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) treatment at 2 and 6 h post MCAO produced significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, treatment at latter time points did not produce significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in blood and nitrotyrosine in brain sections was observed on FeTMPyP and FeTPPS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As delayed treatment of FeTMPyP and FeTPPS produced neuroprotection, we tested whether treatment had any influence over the apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation and in situ nick end-labeling assays showed that FeTMPyP and FeTPPS treatment reduced IR injury-induced DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> decomposition catalysts (FeTMPyP and FeTPPS) produced prominent neuroprotection even if administered 6 h post MCAO and the neuroprotective effect is at least in part due to the reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
