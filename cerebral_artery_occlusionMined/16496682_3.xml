<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg x kg(-1) of HSYA were administrated to three groups of rats, separately, via sublingular vein injection 30 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats, neurological deficit scores were evaluated and the infarction area of brain was assessed by quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro neuroprotective effect of HSYA was tested in cultured fetal cortical neurons exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33192">sodium cyanide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33192">NaCN</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HSYA at doses of 3.0 and 6.0 mg x kg(-1) exerted significant neuroprotective effects on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury as expressed by neurological deficit scores and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as compared with saline group, and the potency of HSYA at dose of 6.0 mg x kg(-1) was similar to that of 0.2 mg x kg(-1) of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies, HSYA significantly inhibited neurons damage induced by exposure to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33192">NaCN</z:chebi> in cultured fetal cortical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HSYA has potential neuroprotective action against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and cultured rat fetal cortical neurons as well </plain></SENT>
