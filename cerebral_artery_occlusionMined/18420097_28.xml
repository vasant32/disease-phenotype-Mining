<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate vascular effects of diet supplementation with plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35915">sterol esters</z:chebi> (PSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35915">sterol esters</z:chebi> are used as food supplements to reduce cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their effects on endothelial function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or atherogenesis are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In mice, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> concentrations were correlated with endothelial function, cerebral lesion size, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma and tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 82 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with those fed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chow (NC), <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice fed with NC supplemented with 2% PSE showed increased plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> but equal cholesterol plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PSE supplementation impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and increased cerebral lesion size after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test the effects of cholesterol-lowering by PSE, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE)-/- mice were randomized to Western-type diet (WTD) with the addition of PSE or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> (EZE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with WTD, both interventions reduced plaque sizes; however, WTD + PSE showed larger plaques compared with WTD + EZE (20.4 +/- 2.1% vs. 10.0 +/- 1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> plasma concentration strongly correlated with increased atherosclerotic lesion formation (r = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we examined plasma and aortic valve concentrations of plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> in 82 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients eating PSE-supplemented margarine (n = 10) showed increased plasma concentrations and 5-fold higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> concentrations in aortic valve tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">Food supplementation</z:chebi> with PSE impairs endothelial function, aggravates ischemic brain injury, effects atherogenesis in mice, and leads to increased tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> concentrations in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prospective studies are warranted that evaluate not only effects on cholesterol reduction, but also on clinical endpoints </plain></SENT>
