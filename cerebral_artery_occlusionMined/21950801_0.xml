<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unmet need in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research is to identify viable targets and to understand their interplay during the temporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a temporal signature of the ischemic hemisphere revealed by the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based 2D-LC-MS/MS strategy in an in vivo middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of focal cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To recapitulate clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, two hours of MCAO was followed by 0, 4, and 24 h of reperfusion to capture <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> durations of reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subsequent iTRAQ experiment identified 2242 proteins from the ischemic hemisphere with &lt;1.0% false discovery rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data mining revealed that (1) about 2.7% of detected proteins were temporally perturbed having an involvement in the energy metabolism (Pygb, Atp5b), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity (Slc1a3, Glud1), neuro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (Tf, C3, Alb), and cerebral plasticity (Gfap, Vim, Gap43); (2) astrocytes participated actively in the neurometabolic coupling underlining the importance of a cerebro-protective rather than a neuro-protective approach; and (3) hyper-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> yet progressive opening of the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), accompanied by stimulation of an innate immune response and late activation of a regenerative response, which provides an extended therapeutic window for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several regulated proteins (Caskin1, Shank3, Kpnb1, Uchl1, Mtap6, Epb4.1l1, Apba1, and Ube1x) novel in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were also discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our result supports a dynamic multitarget therapy rather than the traditional approach of a unilateral and sustained modulation of a single target to address the phasic regulation of an ischemic proteome </plain></SENT>
