<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the NOS activity of neurons in cortex was increased significantly at 15 min after MCAO, reached its peak at 30 min after MCAO and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels at 60 min after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NOS activity of neurons in the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>-treated group was decreased significantly as compared with that in the ischemic group at 15 min and 30 min after MCAO respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> could inhibit the elevated NOS activity of neurons in cortex induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
