<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that the knockdown or knockout of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) isoforms, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, worsens ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the activation of these antiporters exerts a neuroprotective action against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, drugs able to increase the activity of NCXs are not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have here succeeded in synthesizing a new compound, named neurounina-1 (7-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2(3H)-one), provided with an high lipophilicity index and able to increase NCX activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) radiotracer, Fura-2 microfluorimetry, and patch-clamp techniques revealed that neurounina-1 stimulated NCX1 and NCX2 activities with an EC(50) in the picomolar to low nanomolar range, whereas it did not affect NCX3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by using chimera strategy and site-directed mutagenesis, three specific molecular determinants of NCX1 responsible for neurounina-1 activity were identified in the α-repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, NCX3 became responsive to neurounina-1 when both α-repeats were replaced with the corresponding regions of NCX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies showed that 10 nM neurounina-1 reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation followed by reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro, neurounina-1 also reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) release, enhanced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) currents, and inhibited both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More important, neurounina-1 proved to have a wide therapeutic window in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when administered at doses of 0.003 to 30 μg/kg i.p., it was able to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> even up to 3 to 5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the present study shows that neurounina-1 exerts a remarkable neuroprotective effect during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and increases NCX1 and NCX2 activities </plain></SENT>
