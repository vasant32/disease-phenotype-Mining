<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of these deflections on cerebral blood flow, tissue oxygen tension, and electrophysiology was studied in rats submitted to intraluminal thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and compared with the changes following <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>)-induced spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, cortical laser-Doppler flow (LDF) in the periphery of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory sharply decreased to 35 +/- 14% of control (mean +/- SD; p &lt; 0.05), tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> declined from 28 +/- 4 to 21 +/- 3 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.05), and EEG power fell to approximately 80% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 7-h occlusion, 3-11 DC deflections with a mean duration of 5.2 +/- 4.8 min occurred at irregular intervals, and EEG power gradually declined to 66 +/- 16% of control (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the passage of DC deflections, LDF did not change, but <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> further declined to 19 +/- 4 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced depolarizations of intact rats were significantly shorter (1.4 +/- 0.5 min; p &lt; 0.05) and were accompanied by a 43% increase in LDF (p &lt; 0.05) and a slight but significant increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> from 22 +/- 4 to 25 +/- 4 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison of periinfarct and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced depolarizations demonstrates that oxygen requirements are not coupled to an appropriate flow response in the periinfarct zone with severely reduced blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
