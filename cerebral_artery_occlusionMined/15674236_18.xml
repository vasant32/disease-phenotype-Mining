<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, another <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> derivative, provide protection in permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wt FVB/N, Balb/C, and two lines of MMP-9 ko and their wt C57Bl/6 control mice were subjected to 24- or 72-hour permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug administration was started either 12 hours before or 2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In wt strains, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> treatments started before MCAO reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 25% to 50%, whereas the treatment started after MCAO was not protective </plain></SENT>
