<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BAO patients enrolled from the Japanese multicenter registry involving 600 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with the low-dose intravenous alteplase were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had BAO (8 women ranging from 32-92 years of age; mean baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS] score 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was cardioembolic in 15 patients and atherothrombotic in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAO was recanalized during hospitalization in 18 (78%) of 23 patients undergoing follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the initial 24 hours, 14 patients (56%) had a ≥8-point decrease in the NIHSS score, being more common than 267 patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCO) from the same registry (odds ratio [OR] 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-5.97) after adjustment by sex, age, and baseline NIHSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 4 patients (16%) had a ≥4-point increase in the score, being marginally more common than MCO patients (OR 3.13; 95% CI 0.81-10.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> within the initial 36 hours (8% v 5%), independence at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2, 48% v 52%), and mortality at 3 months (4% v 6%) were similar when comparing BAO and MCO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared with previous studies of BAO, vital and functional outcomes at 3 months were relatively better in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of low-dose alteplase resulted in similar outcomes when comparing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO and MCO patients </plain></SENT>
