<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) improves clinical outcome which may, however, be partially offset by significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> (ICB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objects: The comparative effects of microplasmin (microPli) and tPA on ICB were evaluated in a thrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A dose of microPli (5 mg kg(-1)) or tPA (4 mg kg(-1)) which are comparably effective for reduction of brain damage, or a double dose (10 or 8 mg kg(-1), respectively) or the microPli excipient as a control were intravenously administered as a bolus at 30 min or 4 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICB was measured at 24 h by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> assay of exsanguinated brain extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> time was measured by tail cutting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In controls given solvent at 4 h, ICB was on average 8.8 micro L, which was significantly increased with 10 mg kg(-1) microPli and with 4 and 8 mg kg(-1) tPA to 12-13 micro L (P &lt; 0.05 each vs. controls, n = 7-9), whereas 5 mg kg(-1) microPli did not affect <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (8.5 micro L P = NS vs. controls, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When given at 30 min, neither microPli nor tPA altered ICB (6.3-6.8 micro L, mean; n = 7-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>tPA but not microPli <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding time</z:hpo>; from 2.4 min in controls to 5.9 min (median, P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) and 8.7 min (P &lt; 0.01 vs. controls) with 4 and 8 mg kg(-1), respectively, and to 2.3 and 2.9 min with 5 and 10 mg kg(-1) microPli, respectively (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: microPli at a dose comparably effective as tPA for brain damage reduction induced significantly less ICB, and less <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolongation in mice with thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
