<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavenger 1,3-dimethyl-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36946">thiourea</z:chebi> (DMTU) reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine whether this protection results from a preservation of the CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with DMTU (750 mg/kg i.p.) or saline vehicle 1 h before right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-half 4, or 24 h after MCAO, animals were killed and samples were taken from the central, intermediate, and outer zones of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution of each cortical mantle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate groups of animals were used to analyze these samples for water content (wet and dry weight), CBF [( <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]butanol), or blood-brain barrier permeability [( 3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF was reduced in a graded fashion in the ischemic cortex: 0.169 +/- 0.020, 0.261 +/- 0.017, and 0.435 +/- 0.023 ml/g/min (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, n = 8) after 4 h in the central, intermediate, and outer zones, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was present in a similar pattern, while blood-brain barrier permeability remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with DMTU significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in the central and intermediate zones at both 4 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, CBF in the DMTU-treated animals was identical to that of the vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> play a role in the development of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, but the mechanism does not appear to involve a direct effect on CBF </plain></SENT>
