<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition blocks the early disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, but the long-term consequences of short-term MMP inhibition are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a method to quantify <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability by graphical methods was described, which provides a way to study both early disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and long-term effects on recovery in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB1101, to determine both the usefulness of the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for treatment studies and the long-term effects on recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed in control (N=6) and drug-treated (N=8) groups on a dedicated 4.7-T MRI scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult Wistar-Kyoto underwent a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by an MRI study after 3 h of reperfusion, which consisted of T2- and diffusion-weighted techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a rapid T1 mapping protocol was also implemented to acquire one pre-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid</z:chebi> baseline data set followed by postinjection data sets at 3-min intervals for 45 mins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same animal was imaged again at 48 h for lesion size estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data was postprocessed pixel-wise to generate apparent diffusion coefficient and permeability coefficient maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with BB-1101 significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability at 3 h, but failed to reduce lesion size at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Behavioral studies showed impairment in recovery in treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging allowed for the monitoring of multiple parameters in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our studies showed that BB-1101 was an excellent inhibitor of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, results show that BB-1101 may be responsible for significant deterioration in neurologic status of treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although these preliminary results suggest that BB-1101 is useful in reducing early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage owing to reperfusion injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, further studies will be needed to determine whether the later detrimental effects can be eliminated by shorter time course of drug delivery </plain></SENT>
