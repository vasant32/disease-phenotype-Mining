<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to H(2), hydrogen-rich saline (HS) may be more suitable for clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether HS can offer a neuroprotective effect in a rat model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and what mechanism(s) underlies the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different doses of HS or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline were intraperitoneally administered at 5min after pMCAO or sham operation followed by injections at 6h, 12h and 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that HS treatment significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurobehavioral outcomes at 24h, 48h and 72h after pMCAO operation in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that HS treatment dose-dependently increased the activities of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes (SOD and CAT) as well as decreased the levels of oxidative products (8-iso-PGF2α and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and HMGB1) in injured ipsilateral brain tissues at 6h, 12h and 24h after pMCAO operation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, hydrogen-rich saline dose-dependently exerts a neuroprotective effect against permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and its beneficial effect is at least partially mediated by reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular hydrogen may be an effective therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
