<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Age is a primary risk factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that is often overlooked in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We contend that using aged animals yields insight into aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury and recovery that are masked, or not elicited, in younger animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined effects of co-administration of a plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, Glu-Glu-Iso-Iso-Met-Asp (EEIIMD), with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and functional outcome in aged rats following a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of our study showed aged (18-20 months) rats treated with EEIIMD along with tPA had reduced cortical infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, aged rats showed no improvement in total infarction volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, or functional outcome as compared to aged rats administered only tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young adult rats (3-4 months) treated with EEIIMD showed significant improvement in cortical and total infarction volumes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Striatal infarction volume was unaffected by EEIIMD treatment in both young adult and aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize that physiological differences exist between young adult and aged rats and suggest that taking aging processes into account when assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may improve our ability to discern which therapeutics can be translated from bench to bedside </plain></SENT>
