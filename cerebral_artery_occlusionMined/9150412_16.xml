<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the neuroprotective activity of DM following both transient (2 h) and permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats using the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were dosed s.c with 20 mg/kg DM at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of brain injury was performed 24 hours after permanent occlusion or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following transient MCAO, vehicle treated rats exhibited a total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 203 +/- 33 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DM produced a 61% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 79 +/- 13 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO produced a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (406 +/- 44 mm3) which was not significantly reduced in size by treatment with DM (313 +/- 58 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarcted hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was not different in vehicle treated rats following transient or permanent MCAO and was not reduced by DM in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following transient MCAO, rectal temperature was elevated 1,2 and 5 hours post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While not inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> or altering physiological parameters such as blood pressure and blood gases, DM attenuated this injury-related increase in temperature, an effect which appeared to correlate with its ability to protect neurons in temperature regulating hypothalamic centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The DM-induced reduction in infarction demonstrated in our model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> provides further support for the in vivo neuroprotective activity of this compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these data demonstrate the limited neuroprotective efficacy of DM when attempting to combat more severe focal ischemic injuries and imply that drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is not ultimately responsible for its protective action </plain></SENT>
