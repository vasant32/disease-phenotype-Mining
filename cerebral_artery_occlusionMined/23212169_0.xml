<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dramatic recovery was defined as a ≥10-point reduction or a total National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 0 to 1 at 24 hours and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization was defined as recanalization within 1 hours after intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome at 3 months was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (median age [interquartile], 79 [70-85] years, male; 34 [52%]) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI-ASPECTS was 6 (5-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dramatic recovery was seen in 16 (24%) and 26 (39%) patients at 24 hours and on day 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization occurred in 22 (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DWI-ASPECTS ≥7 was an independent predictor of dramatic recovery at 24 hours (odds ratio, 100.85; 95% confidence interval, 4.29-2371.40; P=0.004) and 7 days (odds ratio, 14.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.21-90.48; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the favorable outcome rate was not significantly different between patients with DWI-ASPECTS ≥7 with and without early recanalization (60% versus 31%; P=0.228), it was statistically more frequent in patients with DWI-ASPECTS &lt;7 with early recanalization than those without early recanalization (38% versus 0%; P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DWI-ASPECTS predicted short-term recovery in patients with middle cerebral artery trunk occlusion receiving intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with lower DWI-ASPECTS, there may still be benefit from early recanalization </plain></SENT>
