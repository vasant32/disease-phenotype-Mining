<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the therapeutic time window of oral ONO-1301 and the effect of a single subcutaneous injection of ONO-1301-loaded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53493">poly(lactide-co-glycolide)</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>) microspheres (ONO-1301 PLGA MS) on infarction volume, functional deficits and plasma ONO-1301 levels following a 1 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were treated with ONO-1301 (3 mg/kg) orally twice-daily starting 1 (directly), 6 or 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats received a single subcutaneous injection of ONO-1301 PLGA MS (10 mg/kg) directly after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were evaluated directly after, 1 and 6 h, 1, 2, and 3 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and plasma ONO-1301 levels were measured three days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Neurological scores, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly improved in rats repeatedly treated with oral ONO-1301 and subcutaneous ONO-1301 PLGA MS directly after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma ONO-1301 levels were significantly lower in rats treated directly after MCAO (either with ONO-1301 or ONO-1301 PLGA MS) than in rats treated 6 h or 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ONO-1301 PLGA MS subcutaneous treatment directly after MCAO showed a neuroprotective effect as well as oral ONO-1301 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This treatment should be clinically more convenient than ONO-1301 oral administration since it is delivered as a single treatment after MCAO </plain></SENT>
