<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been clinically reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> can develop after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the detailed mechanisms underlying this are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on the relationship between post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and the development of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, we investigated the time course of alterations in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (FBG) and the development of neuronal damage, including neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (the development of infarction), behavioral abnormality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e>, using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed from 6 h, reaching a maximum on day 3 and was gradually aggravated up to day 5 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 12 h and 1 day after MCAO, FBG was significantly increased and insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory capacity were decreased on 1 day after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the basal plasma insulin levels were significantly higher and adiponectin levels were significantly lower on day 1 in the MCAO group compared with the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was observed on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the neuronal damage observed on day 3 was completely suppressed by continuous administration of insulin during the first 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the early phase of ischemic stress may be involved in the development of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
