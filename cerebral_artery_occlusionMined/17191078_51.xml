<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is known to induce proliferation of neural progenitors in adult rodent brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We presently report that doublecortin positive neuroblasts formed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the posterior peri-ventricle region migrate towards the cortical and striatal penumbra after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in adult rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured neural progenitor cells grafted into the non-infarcted area of the ipsilateral cortex migrated preferentially towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As chemokines are known to induce cell migration, we investigated if monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) has a role in post-ischemic neuroblast migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient MCAO induced an increased expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed that the expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 was localized in the activated microglia and astrocytes present in the ischemic areas between days 1 and 3 of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, infusion of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> striatum induced neuroblast migration to the infusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The migrating neuroblasts expressed the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 receptor CCR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In knockout mice that lacked either <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 or its receptor CCR2, there was a significant decrease in the number of migrating neuroblasts from the ipsilateral SVZ to the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is one of the factors that attract the migration of newly formed neuroblasts from neurogenic regions to the damaged regions of brain after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
