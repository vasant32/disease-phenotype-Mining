<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether near-infrared (NIR)-emitting fluorescence tracer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dots</z:chebi>, would be useful to noninvasively visualize the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) transplanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain in living animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat BMSCs were labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52762">QD800</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo conditions to visualize NIR fluorescence were precisely optimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52762">QD800</z:chebi>-labeled BMSCs were stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the NIR fluorescence imaging technique, the behaviors of BMSCs were serially visualized during the 8 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NIR fluorescence imaging could noninvasively detect the NIR fluorescence emitted from the transplanted BMSCs engrafted in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> neocortex through the scalp up to 8 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensity gradually increased and reached the peak at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were supported by the findings on ex vivo NIR fluorescence imaging and histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NIR fluorescence imaging is valuable in monitoring the behaviors of donor cells in the rodent brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results would allow new opportunities to develop noninvasive NIR fluorescence imaging as a modality to track the BMSCs transplanted into the brain </plain></SENT>
