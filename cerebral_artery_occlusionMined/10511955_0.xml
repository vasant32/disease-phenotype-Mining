<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) used in tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its indication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion on angiographic degree of leptomeningeal collateral flow in a series of 26 patients (mean age: 67.2 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusion types were classified into three types: (1) M 1 proximal occlusion (N = 8) involved the lenticulostriate arteries (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>), (2) M 1 distal occlusion (N = 6) without involvement of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> to M 2 bifurcation, (3) M 2-3 occlusion (N = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In M 1 proximal and distal type, 100% patients had complete or partial recanalization till 5.3 and 6 hours, and 91.7% recanalized in M 2-3 type within 3.96 hours from attack on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> post LIF showed in 50%, but had no clinical change for the worse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was 65% in excellent or good prognosis on 2 months after attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the range of 600,000-2,400,000 units of t-PA (mean = 1,107,000 units), small hemorrhagic transformation were developed in 5 cases (19.2%) without influence on its outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It means that below 2,400,000 units t-PA for LIF were safety amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with poor collateral flow in angiographic findings, good prognosis could be possible in 75% within 4 hours (M = 3.96 hours) recanalization on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that LIF used in t-PA would be efficatious in M 1 proximal occlusion within 4 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and in patients with poor collateral flow when recanalized within 4 hours after attack </plain></SENT>
