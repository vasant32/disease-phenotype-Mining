<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether cannabinoids act as neuroprotectants or, on the contrary, even worsen neuronal damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is currently under discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that treatment with the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716A reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by approximately 40% after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it is suggested that SR141716A may exert neuroprotection besides its cannabinoid receptor-blocking effect, we addressed the question whether SR141716A may act via modulation of postischemic ligand binding to excitatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and/or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35595">isoxazole</z:chebi>-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, rats (n = 12) were treated with either intravenous saline (control) or CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716A (1 mg/kg) 30 min after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, quantitative receptor autoradiography was performed using [(3)H]CP 55,940, [(3)H]MK-801, and [(3)H]AMPA for labeling of CB1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, and AMPA receptors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ligand binding was analyzed within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, cortical penumbra, and corresponding areas of the contralateral hemisphere and compared to that of sham-operated rats (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both in ischemic controls and SR141716A-treated rats [(3)H]CP 55,940 ligand binding was not specifically regulated in the cortical penumbra or contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in SR141716A-treated rats were associated with maintained [(3)H]MK-801 binding to excitotoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors in the penumbra, compared to a decrease in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data suggest that SR141716A may possess additional intrinsic neuroprotective properties independent of receptor-coupled pathways or due to action as a partial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
