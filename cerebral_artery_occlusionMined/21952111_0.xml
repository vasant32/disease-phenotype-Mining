<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and receptors (PDGFRs) are abundantly expressed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, their functions largely remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of PDGFR-β in tissue responses and functional recovery after photothrombolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult mouse brain, PDGFR-β was mainly localized in neurons and in pericyte/vascular smooth muscle cells (PC/vSMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 3 to 28 days after MCAO, postnatally induced systemic PDGFR-β knockout mice (Esr-KO) exhibited the delayed recovery of body weight and behavior, and larger infarction volume than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Esr-KO, PC/vSMC coverage was decreased and vascular leakage of infused fluorescent-labeled albumin was extensive within the ischemic lesion, but not in the uninjured cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> levels were comparable between Esr-KO and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another PDGFR-β conditional KO mouse (Nestin-KO), PDGFR-β was deleted in neurons and astrocytes from embryonic day 10.5, but was preserved in PC/vSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After MCAO, vascular leakage and infarction volume in Nestin-KO were worse than controls, but partly improved compared with Esr-KO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Astroglial scar formation in both Esr-KO and Nestin-KO was similarly reduced compared with controls after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that PDGFR-β signaling is crucial for neuroprotection, endogenous tissue repair, and functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by targeting neurons, PC/vSMCs, and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
