<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pial artery pressure and blood flow were measured in the center of the middle cerebral artery territory, and changes of segmental resistance were determined upstream and downstream of the pial arterial recording site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, pial arterial pressure fell from 59 to 13 mm Hg, and blood flow from 67.4 to 19.6 ml/100 gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Downstream (intracortical) vascular resistance slightly decreased from 0.93 to 0.72 mm Hg X ml-1 X 100 gm X minute, and upstream (extracortical) resistance rose from 0.89 to 6.18 mm Hg X ml-1 X 100 gm X min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, intracarotid infusion of papaverine (625 micrograms/kg/min) and prostacyclin (500 ng/kg/min) caused a reduction of downstream resistance, and intracarotid infusion of nimodipine (670 ng/kg/min) reduced both downstream and upstream resistance </plain></SENT>
