<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exchanger gene superfamily comprises two arms: the K+-independent (NCX) and K+-dependent (NCKX) exchangers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the brain, three different NCX (NCX1, NCX2, NCX3) and three NCKX (NCKX2, NCKX3, NCKX4) family members have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up to now, no sutides about the role played by NCKX proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NCKX2 in an in vivo model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of this protein in the development of ischemic damage was assessed by knocking-down its expression with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN), intracerebroventricularly infused by an osmotic minipump for 48 h, starting from 24 h before pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NCKX2 knocking-down by using antisense strategy increased the extent of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that NCKX2 could exert a neuroprotective effect during ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
