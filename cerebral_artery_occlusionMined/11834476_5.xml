<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of hemodilution on cerebral blood flow (CBF) during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is mitigated by reduced arterial oxygen content (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48233">CaO2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In anesthetized cats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the time course of regional CBF was evaluated after isovolemic exchange transfusion with either albumin or a tetrameric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38849">oxygen carrier</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transfusion started 30 min after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that bulk oxygen transport (CBF x <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48233">CaO2</z:chebi>) to ischemic tissue is increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> transfusion at a hematocrit of 18% compared with albumin-transfused cats at a hematocrit of 18% or control cats at a hematocrit of 30% and equivalent arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the nonischemic hemisphere, CBF increased selectively after albumin transfusion, and oxygen transport was similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic cortex, albumin transfusion increased CBF, but oxygen transport was not increased above that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> transfusion increased both CBF and oxygen transport in the ischemic cortex above values in the control group, but the increase was delayed until 4 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury volume measured at 6 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was not significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the cortex, CBF in the ischemic caudate nucleus was not substantially increased by either albumin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in a large animal model of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in which transfusion starts 30 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, tetrameric cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> transfusion can augment oxygen transport to the ischemic cortex, but the increase can be delayed and not necessarily provide protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an end-artery region such as the caudate nucleus is less likely to benefit from hemodilution </plain></SENT>
