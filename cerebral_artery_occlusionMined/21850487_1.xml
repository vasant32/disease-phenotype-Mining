<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi>, a plant-derived polyphenolic compound, has <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> has protective effects against cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, this study identified the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> pretreatment and elucidate the Nrf2/ARE signaling mechanism after focal cerebral I/R injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham-operated group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion physiological saline-treated group, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>-pretreatmented (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were pretreatmented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> or physiological saline of corresponding volume administered intraperitoneally for 7 days before surgery and 30 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and brain water content were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was evaluated by malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes of brain tissue were observed by HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analysed the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining detected apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells significantly decreased compared with the physiological saline-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>HE staining also showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> significantly improved neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> pretreatment had neuroprotective effects on cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotective effect is likely exerted by upregulated expression of transcription factor Nrf2 and HO-1 to ameliorate oxidative damage, decreased the protein expression of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our finding is important for understanding the neuroprotective mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> and promoting its clinical therapeutic utility </plain></SENT>
