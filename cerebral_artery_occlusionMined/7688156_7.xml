<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: One explanation for inconclusive results with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials may be incomplete information about the time course of calcium-mediated ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores the temporal relation between duration of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the functional activity of increased intracellular calcium as measured by calcium-calmodulin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Calcium-calmodulin binding, determined by immunohistochemical assay of free calmodulin, was measured in 60 male spontaneously hypertensive rats after 2 minutes and after 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours of permanent tandem common carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and after 1 and 2 hours of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 1 and 22 hours of reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic histological damage was measured after 1 hour of occlusion with 23 hours of reperfusion and after 24 hours of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant loss of calmodulin staining in the core of the infarction was noted by 1 hour and became maximal after 4 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No reversal of calmodulin staining loss was noted after reperfusion following 1 and 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> seen by light microscopy correlated well with the area of maximal calcium-calmodulin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The border zone area, represented by a mild loss of calmodulin staining surrounding the central core of maximal binding, gradually decreased in size and became incorporated into the central core after 4 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; it may represent an area of reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-calmodulin binding correlates with duration of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and histological neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> corresponds to the cortical areas displaying a significant loss of calmodulin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as loss of calmodulin staining represents a marker for calcium-mediated activity after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, it suggests a window of opportunity within 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for therapeutic intervention with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
