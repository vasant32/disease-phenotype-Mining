<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological response ranged from severe irreversible damage (<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cavitation) to relatively mild and apparently reversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNMR was the only NMR parameter which demonstrated a statistically significant change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions of brain studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, rho was significantly increased only in the region of brain studied which eventually progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cavitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, data are presented which indicate that changes in T2, DNMR, and rho can occur independently of one another </plain></SENT>
