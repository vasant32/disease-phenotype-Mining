<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reaction of neuroactive substances to ischemic conditions in the rat retina evoked by different methods was immunochemically evaluated in adult Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular ischemic conditions were unilaterally produced by elevating intraocular pressure (EIOP) or by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two EF-hand calcium binding proteins, calbindin D28K (CB) and calretinin (CR), in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retina showed similar immunolocalization, such as the amacrine and displaced amacrine cells, the ganglion cells, and their processes, particularly CB in horizontal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CB immunoreactive neurons in the ganglion cell layer in both types of ischemic retinas were more reduced in number than CR neurons compared to those in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CB protein level in both ischemic retinas was reduced to 60-80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CR protein level in MCAO retinas was reduced to about 80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but increased gradually to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value, whereas that in the EIOP showed a gradual reduction and a slight recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SMI32 immunoreactivity, which detects a dephosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of neurofilaments-M and -H, appeared in the axon bundles of ganglion cells in the innermost nerve fiber layer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reactivity in the nerve fiber bundles appeared to only increase slightly in EIOP retinas, whereas a moderate increase occurred in MCAO retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SMI32 protein level in MCAO retinas showed a gradual increasing tendency, whereas that in the EIOP showed a slight fluctuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the MCAO retinas showed additional SMI32 immunoreactivity in the cell soma of presumed ganglion cells, whereas that of EIOP appeared in the Müller proximal radial fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity appeared in the astrocytes located in the nerve fiber layer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional GFAP immunoreactivity appeared in the Müller glial fibers deep in EIOP retinas and at the proximal end in MCAO retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the neurons in the ganglion cell layer undergo degenerative changes in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, although EIOP retinas represented a remarkable Müller glial reaction, whereas MCAO retinas had only a small-scaled axonal transport disturbance </plain></SENT>
