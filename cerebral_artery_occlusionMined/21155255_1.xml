<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis on the expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 mRNA after the ischemic brain injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats randomly divided into two groups: group A rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 hours by suture, group B rats underwent MCAO for 2 hours meanwhile received treatment with Angelica sinensis (5g/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 st d, 3 rd d and 7 th d after reperfusion, 36 rats( n = 18 in each group) were assessed by neurological scale and brain tissue was taken to assess the lesion ration with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other rats (n = 3 at different time points in each group) were decapitated at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h , 1 st d, 3 rd d, 7 th d after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to examine the gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurologic deficit score of rats in group B decreased significantly compared with group A at the same time point (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of group A was significant greater than group B at the same time point after reperfusion (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of RT-PCR revealed that the gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 in the two groups increased from 3 h after reperfusion and reached its peak at the time of 3 rd d after reperfusion, then declined gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 in the group B was significantly increased than group A at the same time point (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of Flk-1 was positive correlated with Flt-1 in two groups (r = 0.957) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increasing amount of Flt-1, Flk-1 expression was enhanced by Angelica sinensis following transient interruption of cerebral blood flow in rats </plain></SENT>
