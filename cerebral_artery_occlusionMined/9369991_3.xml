<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reduced brain tissue oxygenation is frequently seen in severe head injury and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and this is considered a major cause of secondary ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, in a previous study, we found a tight correlation between low brain tissue oxygen tension and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that an allosteric modifier of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, which improves oxygen transport to tissue, could reduce the size of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in a feline model of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This compound produces a shift in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> dissociation curve to the right and therefore facilitates the unloading of oxygen during low oxygen tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen adult cats were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced through a transorbital, permanent, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven animals received saline, and 10 received the allosteric Hb modifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three different endpoints were used to determine the effect of the allosteric modifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delta p50 values were measured in the arterial blood; the intra-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> oxygen tension was measured, and finally, the volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was assessed using TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean delta p50 changes varied from 10.4 +/- 9.2 mmHg up to 15.0 +/- 6.8 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean intra-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> oxygen tension was 27 +/- 6 mmHg for the control group and 33 +/- 7 mmHg for the drug-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (measured as percentage of hemisphere volume) in the control group was 32 +/- 9% and for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>-13 animals 22 +/- 10% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A definitive trend towards improvement in brain oxygen tension was seen, such that animals pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>-13 showed a higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> oxygen tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced in the drug group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>-13 is potentially beneficial in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Since human studies with this compound are already completed, and other compounds which increase oxygen delivery, such as perfluorocarbons, are already being evaluated, it is likely that oxygen delivery enhancement will rapidly become the first 'neuroprotective' modality, employed in patients with severe brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
