<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A model for reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in rats was used to study changes in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 5, 15, or 30 min in normoglycemic rats, the tissue was frozen in situ, and samples from the lateral caudoputamen and from two neocortical areas were collected for metabolite analyses, together with a control sample from the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other groups, subjected to 30 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, were made hyperglycemic by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion or by prior injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic techniques were used for measurements of phosphocreatine, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, ATP, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neocortex of the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere had labile metabolites that were similar to those measured in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral neocortex bordering the focus, and thus constituting the "penumbra," showed mild to moderate ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the "focus" (lateral caudoputamen plus the overlying neocortex), deterioration of energy state was rapid and relatively extensive (ATP content 20-40% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 5 min of occlusion, no further deterioration of metabolic parameters was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substrate levels were markedly reduced, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content rose to approximately 10 mM kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
