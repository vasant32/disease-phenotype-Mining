<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In-bore middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) enables investigators to acquire preischemic MRI data and to image ischemic changes immediately after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a highly successful in-bore MCAO method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes the methods and pertinent techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to temporary (n=36) or permanent (n=31) MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occluding device consisted of a supporting tubing, a driving line, and a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated 4-0 nylon suture occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outside the magnet, the occluder was positioned in the carotid canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO was achieved in the magnet bore by remotely advancing the driving line until resistance was felt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) were acquired before and immediately after occlusion and were used to document the presence of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine (88.1%) rats were successfully occluded, demonstrating hyperintensity on DWI, perfusion deficits on PWI, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> at postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average values of the apparent diffusion coefficient in both the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen significantly decreased as early as 3 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The failures included preocclusion damage (1/67), sliding out of the occluder during occlusion (1/67), no occlusion (2/67), and arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (4/67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our in-bore MCAO method is easily performed and is as successful as MCAO induced outside the magnet </plain></SENT>
