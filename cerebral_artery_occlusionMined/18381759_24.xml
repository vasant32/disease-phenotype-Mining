<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports indicate that inhibiting the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enhances neurosurvival and limits expansion of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immune response that is initiated in the spleen has been linked to the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that removal of the spleen significantly reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats splenectomized 2 weeks before permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had a &gt;80% decrease in infarction volume in the brain compared with those rats that were subjected to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy also resulted in decreased numbers of activated microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils present in the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the peripheral immune response as mediated by the spleen is a major contributor to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that enhances <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
