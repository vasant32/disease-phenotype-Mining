<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from another hematopoietic source, bone marrow, have been found to differentiate into neural cells and are effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we administered hUCB cells intravenously into the femoral vein or directly into the striatum and assessed which route of cell administration produced the greatest behavioral recovery in rats with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were immunosuppressed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When spontaneous activity was measured using the Digiscan automated system, it was found to be significantly less when hUCB was transplanted 24 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with nontransplanted, stroked animals (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, behavioral recovery was similar with both striatal and femoral hUCB delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the step test, in which significant improvements were found only after femoral delivery of the hUCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the passive avoidance test, transplanted animals learned the task faster than nontransplanted animals (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that hUCB transplantation may be an effective treatment for brain injuries, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, intravenous delivery may be more effective than striatal delivery in producing long-term functional benefits to the stroked animal </plain></SENT>
