<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the potential relationship between pretreatment ASPECTS and tPA-induced recanalization in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS &amp; METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were treated with standard IV-tPA and assessed with transcranial Doppler (TCD) for arterial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization was determined with previously validated Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow-grading system at 120 minutes after tPA-bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pretreatment CT-scans were prospectively scored by trained investigators blinded to TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome at 3 months was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IV-tPA was administered in 192 patients (mean age 68 +/- 14 years, median NIHSS-score 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete recanalization (n= 51) had higher median pretreatment ASPECTS (10, interquartile range 2) than patients with incomplete or absent recanalization (n= 141; median ASPECTS 9, interquartile range 3, P= .034 Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An ASPECTS &lt; or =6 was documented in 4% and 17% of patients with present and absent recanalization, respectively (P= .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment ASPECTS was associated with complete recanalization (OR per 1-point increase: 1.54; 95% CI 1.06-2.22, P= .023) after adjustment for baseline characteristics, risk factors, NIHSS-score, pretreatment TIBI grades and site of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> on baseline TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization (OR: 33.97, 95% CI 5.95-185.99, P &lt; .001) and higher ASPECTS (OR per 1-point increase: 1.91; 95% CI 1.17-3.14, P= .010) were independent predictors of good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher pretreatment ASPECT-scores are associated with a greater chance of complete recanalization and favorable long-term outcome in tPA-treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
