<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male SOD-transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates (30-35 g) were subjected to 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h of reperfusion, the mice were decapitated and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evaluated in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the nontransgenic mice, L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> significantly increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as compared with the vehicle, while 7-NI significantly decreased it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the SOD-transgenic mice, L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>-treated animals showed a significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume than vehicle-treated ones, whereas there were no significant differences between 7-NI- and vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that selective inhibition of neuronal NOS ameliorates ischemic brain injury and that both neuronal and endothelial NOS inhibition may result in the deterioration of ischemic injury due to vasoconstriction of the brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neurotoxic role of NO might not be dependent on NO itself, but the reaction with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, because of no additive effects of SOD and a neuronal NOS inhibitor </plain></SENT>
