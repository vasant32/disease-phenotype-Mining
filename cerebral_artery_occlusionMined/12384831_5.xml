<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats aged twelve to fourteen weeks were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their ovaries were removed one week prior to the implantation of the pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> group, a 500 microg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> 21 day-release pellet was implanted and for the control group, a vehicle pellet was implanted 21 days before the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia, the transfer coefficient of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> (104 Daltons) and the volume of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (70,000 Daltons) distribution were determined to represent the degree of blood-brain barrier disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressures and blood gases were similar between controls and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the transfer coefficient of the ischemic cortex was higher than that of the corresponding contralateral cortex (control: Ischemic Cortex 12.5 +/- 5.9 microl/g/min, Contralateral Cortex 3.0 +/- 1.6, p &lt; 0.001; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>: Ischemic Cortex 6.7 +/- 3.3 micro l/g/min, Contralateral Cortex 2.2 +/- 0.9, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the transfer coefficient of the contralateral cortex between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the transfer coefficient of the Ischemic Cortex of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated animals was 46 % lower than that of the control, vehicle-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
