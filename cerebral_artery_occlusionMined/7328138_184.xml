<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A procedure for occluding the stem of the proximal middle cerebral artery of the rat is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The operation is performed under anaesthesia through a small subtemporal craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After occlusion, 3 animals were perfused with carbon block and 8 with a FAM <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> (40% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>, glacial <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carbon black studies demonstrated an area of impaired perfusion corresponding to the territory of the occluded artery in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological studies invariably showed that there was ischaemic brain damage in the cortex and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frontal cortex was involved in every animal, as was the lateral part of the neostriatum; the sensorimotor and auditory cortex were involved in most animals, whereas the occipital cortex and medial striatum were involved only infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The damage produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> could be readily distinguished from the small local lesion seen at the surgical site in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability to produce a consistent focal ischaemic lesion in the rodent brain provides a technical approach that is sufficiently reproducible to enable investigation of the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> using recently developed autoradiographic and neurochemical methods </plain></SENT>
