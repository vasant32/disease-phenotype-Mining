<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that regional cerebrovascular reactivity (rCVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> can be a reliable predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven symptomatic patients were enrolled in this prospective, longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met inclusion criteria of cerebral angiography, no or localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on MRI or CT, and no or minimal neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and rCVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were quantitatively determined by (133)Xe SEPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were categorized into 4 types on the basis of SPECT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 42.7 months, 16 total and 7 ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual risks of total and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with decreased rCBF and rCVR were 35.6% and 23.7%, respectively, risks that are higher than those in other types of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were categorized into patients with and without decreased rCBF and rCVR, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the risks of total and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with decreased rCBF and rCVR were significantly higher than in those without (P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.0001, respectively, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relative risk conferred by decreased rCBF and rCVR was 8.0 (95% CI, 1.9 to 34.4) for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 9.3) for total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased rCBF and rCVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> may identify a subgroup of patients who have a higher risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> when treated medically </plain></SENT>
