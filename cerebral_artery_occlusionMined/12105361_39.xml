<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of local intra-arterial thrombolysis (LIT) using urokinase in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed clinical and radiological findings and functional outcome 3 months after LIT with urokinase of 100 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To measure outcome, the modified Rankin scale (mRs) score was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiography showed occlusion of the M1 segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 57 patients, of the M2 segment in 21, and of the M3 or M4 segment in 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at admission was 14, and, on average, 236 minutes elapsed from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to LIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (47%) had an excellent outcome (mRs score 0 to 1), 21 (21%) a good outcome (mRs score 2), and 22 (22%) a poor outcome (mRs score 3 to 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (10%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excellent or good outcome (mRs score &lt; or =2) was seen in 59% of patients with M1 or M2 and 95% of those with M(3) or M(4) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization as seen on angiography was complete (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] grade 3) in 20% of patients and partial (TIMI grade 2) in 56% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age &lt;60 years (P&lt;0.05), low NIHSS score at admission (P&lt;0.00001), and vessel recanalization (P=0.0004) were independently associated with excellent or good outcome and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with poor outcome (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 7 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LIT with urokinase that is administered by a single organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> team is safe and can be as efficacious as thrombolysis has been in large multicenter clinical trials </plain></SENT>
