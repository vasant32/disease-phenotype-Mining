<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We initially established the model of WM intervention for rats and identified possible effects of willed movement on motor recovery and on expression of Kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> core (IC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> penumbra (IP) regions of rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two adult male Sprague Dawley rats after successful 120-min period of occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery were selected and randomly divided into three groups: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), WM and environmental modification (EM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological and neurobehavioral assessments were performed and the rats were killed at various recirculation times after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-PCR were used to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of GluR1-GluR4 subunit of AMPA receptors in the areas of IC and IP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats following WM intervention showed significantly better acquisition of climbing (every time point tested), forelimb mobility and neurological functions at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the expression levels of GluR1-GluR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> among three groups in IC region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, GluR1 and GluR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of rats in group WM were significantly upregulated as compared with rats in group MCAO and group EM in IP region at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early willed movement treatment can increase the expression level of AMPA receptor subunits and thus might increase synaptic transmission and enhance brain plasticity after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
