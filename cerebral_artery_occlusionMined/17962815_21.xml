<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the role of TIMP-3 in Fas-mediated neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, using both gene deletion and pharmacological approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In culture, exposure of primary cortical neurons to 2 h of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) resulted in delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that was dependent on activation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor, Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical cultures derived from timp-3(-/-) mice displayed partial resistance against OGD-induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and also displayed increased shedding of Fas ligand (FasL) into the culture media, compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the increased neuroprotection and increased FasL shedding in timp-3(-/-) cultures were reversed by addition of exogenous metalloproteinase inhibitors, recombinant TIMP-3 or GM6001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, timp-3(-/-) mice showed marked resistance to a brief (30 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), but were not protected against more severe lesions induced by 90 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that TIMP-3 facilitates Fas-mediated neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following OGD and plays a pro-apoptotic role in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
