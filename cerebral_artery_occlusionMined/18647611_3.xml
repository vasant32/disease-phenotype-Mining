<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Three animal models were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first, saponin conjugated with substance P (SP-SAP) was injected into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to block the central baroreflex arc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second model, sinoaortic denervation (SAD) was performed to destroy the peripheral baroreflex arc in SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the third model, SD rats were divided into two groups according to their naturally occurring BRS values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After determining hemodynamic indexes and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), we subjected the animals to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 were detected both in SAD/sham operation groups and low/high BRS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three animal models, baroreflex dysfunction significantly increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of inflammatory factors were markedly elevated in SAD and low BRS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that the function of arterial baroreflex is an important determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
