<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence points to a role for circulating endothelial progenitor cells, including populations of CD34- and CD133-positive cells present in peripheral blood, in maintenance of the vasculature and neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immature populations, including CD34-positive cells, have been shown to contribute to vascular homeostasis, not only as a pool of endothelial progenitor cells but also as a source of growth/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> factors at ischemic loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that diminished numbers of circulating immature cells might impair such physiological and reparative processes, potentially contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The level of circulating immature cells, CD34-, CD133-, CD117-, and CD135-positive cells, in patients with a history of atherothrombotic cerebral ischemic events was analyzed to assess possible correlations with the degree of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong inverse correlation between numbers of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no correlation between the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and populations of circulating immature cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> revealed a significant positive correlation between circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and regional blood flow in areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a possible contribution of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells in maintenance of the cerebral circulation in settings of ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate the utility of a simple and precise method to quantify circulating CD34-positive cells, the latter providing a marker of cerebrovascular function </plain></SENT>
