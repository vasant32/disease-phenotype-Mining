<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, according to our search of the literature, only four cases of aneurysmal subarchnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (SAH) associated with bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) have been reported in addition to the case we report here with a summary of the previously reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A healthy 82-year-old female was found unconscious and admitted to our hospital where her neurological state was diagnosed as Hunt &amp; Kosnik grade II, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General physical examination yielded no abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (Fisher's classification group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An aortogram demonstrated the presence of both vertebral arteries (VA), but the origins of the common carotid arteries (CCAS) were not visible at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left vertebral angiogram (VAG) revealed anastomosis between the muscle branch of the VA and the occipital artery, with retrograde blood flow through the external carotid artery supplying the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings were also visible on the right VAG, but there was severe stenosis of the C2 portion of the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right enlarged posterior communicating artery (Pcom) supplied the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the junction of the right posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and the enlarged right Pcom and the P2 segment of right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, respectively were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in this case was probably caused by hemodynamic stress secondary to bilateral CCAO induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
