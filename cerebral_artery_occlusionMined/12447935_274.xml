<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether focal ischemic injury in adult rat would increase SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration and neuronal differentiation of endogenous precursors in damaged regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced in adult rats by 90-minute right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains examined 10-21 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed markedly increased SVZ neurogenesis and chains of neuroblasts extending from the SVZ to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many BrdU-labeled cells persisted in the striatum and cortex adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but at 35 days after tMCAO only BrdU-labeled cells in the neostriatum expressed neuronal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Newly generated cells in the injured neostriatum expressed markers of medium spiny neurons, which characterize most neostriatal neurons lost after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that focal ischemic injury increases SVZ neurogenesis and directs neuroblast migration to sites of damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neuroblasts in the injured neostriatum appear to differentiate into a region-appropriate phenotype, which suggests that the mature brain is capable of replacing some neurons lost after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
