<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> affects parvalbumin expression in focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg) 2 hr after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">Nicotinamide</z:chebi> significantly decreases the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proteomic approach revealed that MCAO induces decreases of parvalbumin levels, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> treatment prevents injury-induced decreases in parvalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> restores injury-induced decreases in parvalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the numbers of parvalbumin-positive cells were decreased in vehicle-treated animals with MCAO, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> averted this decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cultured hippocampal cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> treatment prevents the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> exposure-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and decrease in parvalbumin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the fact that the maintenance of parvalbumin expression is mediated to the neuroprotective function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
