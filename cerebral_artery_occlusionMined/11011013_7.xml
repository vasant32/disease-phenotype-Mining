<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most transient IDs are akin to spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD), although a negative DC shift is not observed in half the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other IDs may represent transient anoxic depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using cortical DC and blood flow recordings, following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats, we show here that: (i) these later depolarizations do indeed represent transient anoxic depolarizations; (ii) SD-like IDs, DC and haemodynamic parameters are similar to those of SDs when blood flow remains close to base line and; (iii) when blood flow decreases, the hyperaemia associated with SD-like IDs is largely reduced and there is an increasing proportion of cortical sites which fail to display a DC shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the coexistence of two mechanisms of IDs, and yield new information as to the flow-dependence of DC and haemodynamic correlates of SD-like IDs, the pathophysiological significance of which remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
