<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">Nicotinamide</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt, also known as visfatin), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> (+) biosynthesis, protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> through inhibiting neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was taken to determine the involvement of autophagy in neuroprotection of Nampt in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) in cultured cortical neurons were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nampt was overexpressed or knocked-down using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunochemistry (LC3-II), electron microscope and immunoblotting assays (LC3-II, beclin-1, mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> [mTOR], S6K1 and tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex-2 [TSC2]) were performed to assess autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that overexpression of Nampt increased autophagy (LC3 puncta immunochemistry staining, LC3-II/beclin-1 expression and autophagosomes number) both in vivo and in vitro at 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the early stage of OGD, autophagy inducer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> protected against neuronal injury induced by Nampt knockdown, whereas autophagy inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> abolished the neuroprotective effect of Nampt partly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression or knockdown of Nampt regulated the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K1 signaling pathway upon OGD stress through enhancing phosphorylation of TSC2 at Ser1387 but not Thr1462 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in cultured SIRT1-knockout neurons, the regulation of Nampt on autophagic proteins LC3-II and beclin-1 was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that Nampt promotes neuronal survival through inducing autophagy via regulating TSC2-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway in a SIRT1-dependent manner during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
