<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to compare the neuroprotective effects of low-dose and high-dose of selective β1-adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in rats after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> contribute to neuroprotection of the β-adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 120 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats received intravenous infusion of saline 0.5 mL/h, esmolol 200, esmolol 2000, landiolol 50, or landiolol 500 μg/kg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the drugs were started 30 minutes before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and continued for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores were evaluated at 1, 4, and 7 days, whereas the brains were removed and stained at 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the esmolol 200, and landiolol 50 μg/kg/min groups of additional rats, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentrations in the striatum were measured separately by microdialysis during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, 120 min; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, 110 min) and reperfusion (40 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological deficit scores were smaller in rats treated with esmolol or landiolol than in saline-treated rats at 1, 4, and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were smaller in rats receiving β-adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> than in the saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in neurological score or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between the groups receiving the different doses of β1-adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the esmolol-treated or landiolol-treated rats was significantly smaller than that in the saline-treated rats, whereas no significant differences were noted in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the improvement in neurological and histologic outcomes by selective β1-adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is partly attributed to attenuation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
