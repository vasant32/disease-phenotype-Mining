<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extracellular <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> associates with its high-affinity binding protein, hemopexin (HPX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemopexin is shown here to be expressed by cortical neurons and it is present in mouse cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> model (90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 96-h survival), we provide evidence that HPX is protective in the brain, as neurologic deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly greater in HPX(-/-) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addressing the potential protective HPX cellular pathway, we observed that exogenous free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> decreased cell survival in primary mouse cortical neuron cultures, whereas the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> bound to HPX was not toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi>-HPX complexes induce HO1 and, consequently, protect primary neurons against the toxicity of both <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> and pro-oxidant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi>; such protection was decreased in HO1(-/-) neuronal cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that HPX protects against <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-induced toxicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and that HO1 is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-HPX system protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related damage by maintaining a tight balance between free and bound <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, regulating extracellular free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> levels, such as with HPX, could be neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
