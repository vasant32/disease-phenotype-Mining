<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats that underwent microsurgical middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were blindly assigned to a single intraperitoneal injection of nilvadipine (0.32 mg/kg) or the same amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> either 15 minutes before, immediately after, 1 hour after, or 3 hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic conditions of rats were closely examined, and rats were killed 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Removed brains were sliced coronally, stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no neurologic improvements were observed in the treated rats, the area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was significantly reduced in the groups treated before, immediately after, and 1 hour after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
