<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of many pro-inflammatory genes including the cytokine interleukin-6 is known to be controlled by C/EBPbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) significantly increases C/EBPbeta gene expression in mouse brain at between 6 and 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the functional significance of C/EBPbeta in postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and brain damage, we induced transient MCAO in cohorts of adult C/EBPbeta null mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 days of reperfusion following transient MCAO, C/EBPbeta null mice showed significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, reduced neurological deficits, decreased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling-positive cells, decreased intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM1) immunopositive vessels, decreased extravasated neutrophils and fewer activated microglia/macrophages, compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GeneChip analysis showed that postischemic induction of many transcripts known to promote <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neuronal damage was less pronounced in the brains of C/EBPbeta-/- mice compared with C/EBPbeta+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a significant role for C/EBPbeta in postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and brain damage </plain></SENT>
