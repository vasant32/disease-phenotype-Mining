<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, using a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in Wistar rat, we showed autonomic disturbances similar to those seen clinically and observed striking neurochemical changes in cortical and subcortical sites at 5 days following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurochemical changes may account for functional recovery and/or autonomic disturbances after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the possible mechanisms and to facilitate future studies, it is necessary to define the time-courses of these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemical staining with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction, the changes in several neuropeptides over the peri-ischemic region and the ipsilateral central and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were investigated at different times after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the experimental group, neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity appeared to increase by 6 hours in the peri-ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using image analysis to quantify the staining intensity, the change became statistically significant at 1 day, peaked around 3 days, and subsided at 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a delayed increase in neuropeptide Y in the ipsilateral basolateral nucleus of the amygdala with a peak around 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive staining for leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> demonstrated an increase that was localized to the ipsilateral central nucleus of the amygdala with a peak around 3 days and a return to baseline levels by 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results support a specific time-course for each of the neuropeptides studied and indicate that a survival time of 3 days after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the critical period for examining the relationship between neuropeptide responses and neuronal or functional recovery </plain></SENT>
