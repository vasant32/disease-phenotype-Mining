<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic time window of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in rats, and related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=6), sham-operation group, vehicle group, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h treatment group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced with the method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats, and reperfusion was emerged by removing the thread 2 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg ip) was begun at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after MCAO respectively, and subsequently repeated once 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vehicle group was intraperitoneally injected with isodose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological behavior score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was measured 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismetase (SOD), the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and ultrastructure of neuron in brain tissue were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle group, treatments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> both 3 and 6 h after MCAO decreased the neurology deficit score and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only neurology deficit score had been reduced 12 h after MCAO, while no neuropmrotective effects had been observed during 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> elevated the content of SOD, decreased the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in ischemic brain tissue, and alleviated the injury of the neuronal ultrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> exerted a time-dependent neuroprotective effect on the brain after MCAO in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect might be possibly mediated through following mechanisms: lessening <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
