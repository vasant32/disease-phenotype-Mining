<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the protective effect and the relevant mechanisms of DH on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral I/R injury was induced through four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male SD rats were randomly divided into six kinds of groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, sham-operated group, I/R injury group, DH-treated groups at doses of 0.5ml/kg, 1.0ml/kg and 2.0ml/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of DH on murine neurological deficits and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, 6-keto-prostagladin F(1α) (6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1α)) level, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) level and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity in brain tissue, as well as the activities of plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) after I/R were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax protein were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the control group and the sham-operated group based on the measurement indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the vehicle-treated group, rats treated with DH showed dose dependent reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size, and improvement of neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1α) and the activities of SOD and plasma t-PA were enhanced significantly, whereas the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and the activity of plasma PAI were declined significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical staining results also revealed that the expression of Bcl-2 protein was up-regulated and that of Bax protein was down-regulated when exposed to DH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DH demonstrates a strong ameliorative effect on cerebral I/R damage in rats by its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, antithrombotic, antifibrinolytic and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, suppressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through regulating Bcl-2 and Bax protein expressions should be another potential mechanism by which DH exerts its neuroprotective function </plain></SENT>
