<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the tempo of progression to irreversible injury in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we subjected <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats to photochemically induced distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO) combined with permanent ipsilateral and 1 h contralateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Head temperature was maintained at 36 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At times centered at either 1.5 or 3 h post-dMCAO, the rate of local <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (lCMRgl) was measured by 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> autoradiography, and cytoskeletal proteolysis was assessed regionally by an immunoblotting procedure to detect spectrin breakdown products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1.5 h (n = 5), the cortical ischemic core was already severely hypometabolic (lCMRgl 15.5 +/- 10.8 mumol 100 g-1 min-1, mean +/- SD), whereas the cortical penumbral zone was hypermetabolic (69.0 +/- 9.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(The lumped constant was verified to be unchanged by methylglucose studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutral red pH studies at this time point showed that both the core and penumbral zones were equally acidotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 3 h post-dMCAO (n = 6), lCMRgl in the penumbral zone had fallen to low levels (15.4 +/- 2.2 mumol 100 g-1 min-1) equal to those of the ischemic core (16.7 +/- 4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, spectrin breakdown in the ischemic core was advanced at both 2 and 3.5 h post-dMCAO (36 +/- 18% and 33 +/- 18% of total spectrin, respectively), whereas in the penumbral zone spectrin breakdown was less extensive and more highly variable at both times (22 +/- 23% and 29 +/- 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that irreversible deterioration of the ischemic core, as evidenced by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of local cytoskeletal proteolysis, begins within 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic penumbra, the transition from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hyper- to hypometabolism occurs by 3.5 h and is associated with a milder and more variable degree of spectrin breakdown </plain></SENT>
