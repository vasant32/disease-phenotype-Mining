<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of LIT-MCD and to identify factors associated with a poor outcome in patients undergoing this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: LIT-MCD for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was performed in 90 of 1907 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted to our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiographic data and clinical outcome were evaluated in the 90 patients, and factors predictive of a poor outcome (3-month mRS score, 3-6) were investigated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization was achieved in 73 of the 90 patients (81%); symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 7 (8%); procedure-related complications, in 9 (10%); and a favorable clinical outcome (3-month mRS score, 0-2), in 48 (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high baseline NIHSS score (≥20), a low preprocedural ASPECTS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (≤7), proximal M1 occlusion (in the horizontal segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at or proximal to the lenticulostriate arteries), and no recanalization were significant predictors of a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LIT-MCD is a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, further intervention is needed to improve the outcome of patients with proximal M1 occlusion </plain></SENT>
