<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, direct current potential (DC), EEG, and blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry) were recorded from the cortex in the periphery of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats, a single negative cortical DC deflection was observed after electrocoagulation of the cortex, whereas in untreated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded animals, three to eight transient DC deflections were monitored during the initial 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of these cortical DC shifts gradually increased from 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 3.7 +/- 2.7 min (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.05) during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In animals treated intraperitoneally with MK-801 (3.0 mg/kg) immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the number of cortical DC shifts significantly declined to one to three deflections (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEG of the treated animals revealed low-amplitude burst-suppression activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the untreated and treated experimental group, the reduction of cortical blood flow amounted to 69 +/- 25 and 49 +/- 13% of control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the more pronounced cortical oligemia, MK-801 treatment resulted in a significant decrease of the volume of the ischemically injured tissue from 108 +/- 38.5 (untreated group) to 58 +/- 11.5 (p less than 0.05) mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that repetitive cortical DC deflections in the periinfarct border zone contribute to the expansion of ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
