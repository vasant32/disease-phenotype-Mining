<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusive cerebrovascular disease were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had either unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regions-of-interest were placed in non-infarcted areas within the territory of the middle cerebral artery on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control regions-of-interest were placed in mirrored regions of the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were performed using the parameters of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained with perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity, and oxygen extraction fraction obtained with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respective <z:mp ids='MP_0002033'>MTTs</z:mp> of the affected and non-affected sides obtained with perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging versus those with PET were 7.3 +/- 2.2 s and 6.0 +/- 1.2 s versus 8.2 +/- 3.0 s and 6.4 +/- 1.7 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained using perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and PET demonstrated statistically significant correlation (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained with perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging correlated statistically with cerebral blood flow (r = -0.74, p &lt; 0.001), vascular reactivity (r = -0.73, p &lt; 0.001) and oxygen extraction fraction (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained using PET statistically correlated with cerebral blood flow (r = -0.78, p &lt; 0.0001), vascular reactivity (r = -0.51, p &lt; 0.05) and oxygen extraction fraction (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reliability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained using perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging appears to be approximately equal to that obtained with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
