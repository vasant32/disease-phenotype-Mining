<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> were evaluated in 20 patients diagnosed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound as having proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> signs and size of final infarction were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was seen in 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (10%) in patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was higher than the overall <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate of intravenous rt-PA treatment, but comparable to the data on intra-arterial thrombolysis in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroup </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous rt-PA treatment within 3 h may also be effective in patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> does not seem to be greater than in intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
