<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In the present study, we used animal models to investigate whether the selective α(1A)-blocker silodosin exerts inhibitory effects on detrusor overactivity by modulating C-fiber afferent activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To desensitize C-fiber afferents, 0.3 mg/kg of resiniferatoxin (RTX) was subcutaneously injected into some female Sprague-Dawley rats 2 days before creation of each model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1) Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed to create a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) model (CI rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of intravenous (i.v.) and intrathecal (i.t.) administrations of silodosin on cystometrography parameters were evaluated in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Rhythmic bladder pressure was recorded in rats under <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E(2) (0.4 mg/mL) was continuously administered intraurethrally, and the effects of intra-arterial (i.a.) silodosin on the micturition reflex (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Silodosin (i.v.) dose-dependently increased bladder capacity (BC) in CI rats without decreasing bladder contraction pressure, but had no effects on BC in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silodosin (i.t.) markedly increased BC in CI rats, but not in RTX-CI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) After intraurethral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), the bladder contraction interval (BCI) was markedly reduced in non-RTX rats, but unchanged in RTX rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Silodosin (i.a.) significantly prolonged BCI in non-RTX rats receiving intraurethral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the α(1A)-AR subtype activates C-fiber afferents, and that consequently α(1A)-blockade can improve bladder storage function </plain></SENT>
