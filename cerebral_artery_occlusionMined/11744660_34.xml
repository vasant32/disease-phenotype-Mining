<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> contribute to these differences by attenuating neurotoxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury, the effects of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> on neuronal injury in both a cell-culture model and a rodent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> was shown to significantly increase the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> at a 10 microM concentration, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the toxicity at the same concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury was induced by temporal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid the stress-related <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> reduction, male rats were castrated and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was replaced by <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> pellet implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> pellets were removed at 1, 2, 4, or 6 h before MCAO to determine the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was significantly decreased from 239.6 +/- 25.9 mm(3) in control to 122.5 +/- 28.6 mm(3) when <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> pellets were removed at 6 h before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction of lesion volume was associated with amelioration of the hyperemia during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that sex differences in response to brain injury are partly due to the consequence of damaging effects of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
