<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in hypertensive rats, 60 13-week-old animals were treated with 20 mg/kg hydralazine added daily to the drinking water for 1.5, 6, 10, or 16 weeks and then subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by tandem right common carotid artery and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure in the treated groups was substantially lower than that in untreated groups after 1 week of hydralazine therapy and remained lower for the entire treatment period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for 10 (p = 0.02) or 16 (p = 0.005) weeks, but not 1.5 or 6 weeks, was significantly less than that in the untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in animals treated for 10 and 16 weeks was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in hypertensive rats subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This treatment effect appears to be dependent on the duration of therapy, and the magnitude of the treatment effect seems to plateau by 10 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
