<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism of this protection remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the neuroprotective effect of Dex in rats exposed to cerebral I/R-induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in this protective action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 90min followed by reperfusion for 24h and Dex (15μg/kg, i.v.) was administered immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit score, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and neuron survival were evaluated at 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of Dex on p-Akt, p-ERK1/2 and p-GSK-3β expression in the ischemic hemisphere was assayed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of rats exposed to I/R with Dex caused not only marked reduction in the neurological deficit score, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (P &lt;0.01 vs. I/R alone), but also a decrease in neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in hippocampal CA1 and cortex (P&lt;0.01 vs. I/R alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Dex-induced increment of neuron survival in the ischemic CA1 and cortex was diminished by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increasing expressions of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 induced by Dex in the ischemic hemisphere were markedly inhibited by LY294002 (or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>) and U0126 (or PD98059), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The up-regulation of p-GSK-3β by Dex in the ischemic hemisphere was significantly decreased by both LY294002 (or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>) and U0126 (or PD98059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that treatment with Dex reduced cerebral injury in rats exposed to transient focal I/R, and this was mediated by the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways as well the phosphorylation of downstream GSK-3β </plain></SENT>
