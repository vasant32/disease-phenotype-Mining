<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of postischemic treatment of cyclo-RGDfV (cRGDfV), a selective inhibitor of integrin alphavbeta3, in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation (n = 13), MCAO with no treatment (n = 18), and MCAO with cRGDfV treatment (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced with the suture occlusion method for 2 hr, and treatment was given 1 hr after reperfusion (3 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed 24 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment included neurological scores, infarction volumes, brain water content, Evans blue exudation, IgG exudation, histology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with cRGDfV ameliorated neurological deficits, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and reduced exudation of Evans blue dye and IgG, but failed to reduce infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed a reduction in phosphorylation of one subset of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors in the cRGDfV treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blotting also demonstrated a significant reduction of fibrinogen in the cRGDfV treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that poststroke treatment with cRGDfV reduces blood-brain barrier breakdown in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, possibly through inhibition of VEGF-mediated vascular breakdown </plain></SENT>
