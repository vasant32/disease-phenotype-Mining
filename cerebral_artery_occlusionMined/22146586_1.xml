<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase critically contributes to ischemic brain damage via increase in ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We herein tested the hypothesis that NBO protects the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) via inhibiting gp91phox (or called Nox2) containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase in a mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> C57/BL6 mice and gp91phoxknockout mice were given NBO (95% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) during 90-min MCAO, followed by 22.5 hrs of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage was quantified by measuring Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tight junction protein occludin and gp91phox were assessed with western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gel zymography was used to assess the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion led to remarkable Evans blue extravasation, significantly increased gp91phox and MMP-9 levels and decreased occludin levels in the ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In gp91phox knockout mice, the changes in Evans blue extravasation, MMP-9 and occludin were at much smaller magnitudes when compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, NBO treatment significantly reduced the changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured parameters in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice, while did not cause additional reductions in these changes when gp91phox was knocked out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that activation of Nox2 containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase is implicated in the induction of MMP-9, loss of occludin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and inhibition of Nox2 may be an important mechanism underlying NBO-afforded <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> protection </plain></SENT>
