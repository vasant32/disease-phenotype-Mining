<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male ob/ob, lean, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were treated with RSV (10 mg/kg per day, i.p.) or vehicle for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by 60 mins of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and cortical blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IR mice exhibited a higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with Lean or WT mice, and RSV reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume only in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice (40%+/-3% versus 32%+/-3%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood cholesterol and insulin levels were elevated in ob/ob mice but were unaffected by RSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CBF reductions during MCAO were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and were not affected by RSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although RSV did not increase cortical endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels in the ob/ob mice, it attenuated the increased cortical expression of intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after MCAO from ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, RSV protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in IR mice by a mechanism independent of effects on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, CBF, or eNOS but dependent on suppression of post-MCAO ICAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
