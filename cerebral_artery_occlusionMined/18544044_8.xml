<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)/Tie2 pathway mediates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced vascular integrity and migration of neuroblasts after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 hrs of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated, starting 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg, daily) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage and concomitantly, increased Ang1, Tie2 and Occludin expression in the ischaemic border (IBZ) compared to the MCAo control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> also significantly increased doublecortin (DCX, a marker of migrating neuroblasts) expression in the IBZ compared to control MCAo rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DCX was highly expressed around vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the signalling pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced vascular stabilization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, rat brain microvascular endothelial cell (RBMEC) culture was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment of RBMEC increased Ang1 and Tie2 gene and protein expression and promoted phosphorylated-Tie2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased endothelial capillary tube formation, an index of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, compared to non-treated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Ang1 or knockdown of Tie2 gene expression in endothelial cells significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced capillary tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased subventricular zone (SVZ) explant cell migration compared to non-treatment control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Ang1 significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced SVZ cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases Ang1/Tie2 expression and thereby reduces <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and promotes vascular stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ang1/Tie2 expression induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment promotes neuroblast micro-vascular coupling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
