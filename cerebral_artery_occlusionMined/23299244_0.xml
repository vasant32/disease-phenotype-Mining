<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) induces tolerance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether SirT1, a class III <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase, is involved in neuroprotection elicited by HBO-PC in animal and cell culture models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 minutes after HBO-PC (once a day for 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to 2 hours of HBO-PC after 2 hours of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We showed that HBO-PC increased SirT1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, promoted neurobehavioral score, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and improved <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> at 24 hours and 7 days after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection of HBO-PC was attenuated by SirT1 inhibitor EX527 and SirT1 knockdown by short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA), whereas it was mimicked by SirT1 activator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HBO-PC enhanced SirT1 expression and cell viability and reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release 24 hours after OGD/re-oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of HBO-PC was emulated through upregulating SirT1 and, reversely, attenuated through downregulating SirT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The modulation of SirT1 was made by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adenovirus infection</z:e> carrying SirT1 or SirT1 siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides, SirT1 increased B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (Bcl-2) expression and decrease cleaved caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SirT1 mediates HBO-PC-induced tolerance to cerebral I/R through inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 9 January 2013; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.179 </plain></SENT>
