<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (PROG) may be a pleiotropic neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there have been reports about the neurotoxicity of activated microglia and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the influence of PROG on the activation of microglia and the expression of COX-2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not been examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we carried out research about the influence of PROG on cultured microglia by detection of the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in their supernatant fluid before and after induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) or influenced by PROG with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay technique in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of COX-2 and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) was also detected in the cortex of rats that underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and received PROG or vehicle treatment by immunohistochemistry and western blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that PROG significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in cultured microglia after activated with LPS in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, PROG also valuably inhibited the expression of Iba1 and COX-2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations raised the possibility that PROG can exert its neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the activation of microglia and the over expression of COX-2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
