<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, grip strength, locomotor activity tests were performed in the surgically operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After behavioral tests, animals were immediately sacrificed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Locomotor activity and grip strength of animals were improved in both aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts pretreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was also reduced in both extracts pretreated rats as compared with MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) and a reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, viz., <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels were observed following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of Nigella sativa extracts showed the reduction in TBARS, elevation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, SOD and catalase levels as compared with MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study observed the neuroprotective effects of both the extracts of Nigella sativa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects could be due to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, free radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
