<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were exposed to intranasal administration of E-selectin or PBS every other day for 10 days (single-tolerization group) or on two tolerization schedules separated by 11 days (booster-tolerization group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control group received middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO was performed 48 h after the last dose of E-selectin or PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 22 h reperfusion, the rats were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the regional cerebral blood flow, neurological testing, frequencies of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes in blood, plasma SOD activity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of IL-10, TGF-beta(1), E-selectin, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in the ischemic brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 30.25% (P&lt;0.05) decreases of infarction volumes in the E-selectin booster group accompanied by decreased neurological deficit scores compared with PBS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with PBS-treated rats, CD8-positive cells were significantly decreased (27.4%, P&lt;0.05), CD4-positive cells tended to increase (P&gt;0.05), SOD activity was obviously increased (P&lt;0.05), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of IL-10 were markedly increased (21.0%, P&lt;0.05) and TGF-beta(1) showed an upward trend (6.2%, P&gt;0.05), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of E-selectin were prominently decreased (28.7%, P&lt;0.01) and ICAM-1 and LFA-1 had downward trends (P&gt;0.05) in E-selectin booster animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal tolerance to E-selectin after booster tolerization could relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury and induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> tolerance in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms may involve decreased frequencies of CD8+ T cells in blood, increased plasma SOD activity, heightened <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of IL-10 and lowered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of E-selectin in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
