<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from the injured hemisphere at 30 min, 4 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr, 3 days, and 7 days after MCAo for GeneChip analysis using Affymetrix U34 Rat Neurobiology arrays (1,322 functional genes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 267 genes were expressed differentially: 166 genes were upregulated, 94 genes were downregulated, and 7 genes were biphasically up- and downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differentially expressed genes, 88 were newly identified as associated with ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most affected genes were distributed among 12 functional categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate early genes, transcription factors, and heat shock proteins were upregulated as early as 30 min after MCAo, followed by the upregulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cytoskeletal, and metabolism genes, which peaked within 4-24 hr of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurotrophic growth factors exhibited a sustained upregulation beginning 24 hr after MCAo and persisting through 7 days post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three classes of genes were downregulated with distinct temporal patterns: ion channel genes and neurotransmitter receptor genes were downregulated between 8-24 hr after injury, whereas synaptic proteins genes were downregulated between 3-7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of synaptic protein gene expression after ischemic injury is of particular interest because of its conspicuously delayed pattern as a functional group, which has not been reported previously and may play a role in post-injury recovery </plain></SENT>
