<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we use transgenic mice to examine the activation of two different promoters in a firefly luciferase reporter mouse analyzable through a non-invasive bioluminescent imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first model, we examine the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced activation of Smad-binding elements (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>), a downstream target of Smad 1/2/3 transcription factors, in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBEs</z:e> regulate the expression of the fluc reporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that MCAO induces a bilateral activation (i.e., both ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>-luc reporter with a peak at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second model, we examined MCAO-induced activation of the osmolarity-sensitive promoter nuclear factor of activated T-cell 5 (NFAT5) and identified a peak reporter expression 72 h post-MCAO in the ipsilateral but not contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each of these models, the assessment of post-MCAO fluc-expression provided both a quantitative measure (i.e., radiance in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>/cm(2) /steradian) as well as qualitative localization of the molecular response following focal ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
