<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to investigate the potential protective effects of Artemisia absinthium on cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and damage as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion were induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO led to significant rise in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> content, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase activity in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, behavioral deficits like motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> and impairment of short-term memory were also significantly impaired by MCAO as compared with sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and damage, and behavioral deficits were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> extract of Artemisia absinthium (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that Artemisia absinthium is neuroprotective and may prove to be useful adjunct in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
