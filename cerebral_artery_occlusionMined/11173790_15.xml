<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a potent neuroprotective agent in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> including permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GV150526 was very well tolerated in early human studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial was to assess the safety and population pharmacokinetics of GV150526 in patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exploratory assessment of efficacy, quality of life and resource utilisation was also undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, patients were treated with a loading dose of 800 mg GV150526 (or placebo), followed by 5 maintenance doses of 400 mg GV150526 (or placebo) given every 12 h over 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following observation of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e>, the maintenance dose was reduced mid-study to 200 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT/MRI scanning was not mandatory prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study treated 128 patients (38 with GV 800 mg/400 mg, 48 with GV 800 mg/200 mg and 42 with placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NIH scores &lt; or =5) were enrolled in the GV150526-treated groups than in the placebo group (placebo 38%, GV 800 mg/400 mg 18%, GV 800 mg/200 mg 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also an imbalance in the proportion of patients with haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (placebo 5%, GV 800 mg/400 mg 3%, GV 800 mg/200 mg 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality at 1 month was unbalanced between treatment groups, being 10, 18 and 17% in the placebo, GV 800 mg/400 mg and GV 800 mg/200 mg groups, respectively (no significant difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, adverse events, though consistent with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population, appeared more often in the GV 800 mg/200 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes at 1 month also showed imbalances, the percentage of patients with a Barthel Index score of &gt; or =95 at 1 month being 52, 39 and 27% in the placebo, GV 800 mg/400 mg and GV 800 mg/200 mg groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results probably reflect a prognostically significant baseline difference between the groups rather than the effect of GV150526 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>GV150526 was generally well tolerated in patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and formal efficacy studies were considered justified </plain></SENT>
