<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With the advent of thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reperfusion-associated mechanisms of tissue injury have assumed greater importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this experimental study, we used several MRI techniques to monitor the dynamics of secondary ischemic damage, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disturbances, and the development of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> during the reperfusion phase after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 30 minutes, 60 minutes, or 2.5 hours with the suture occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and T1-weighted imaging, was performed 5 to 15 minutes before reperfusion, as well as 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 hours and 1, 2, and 7 days after withdrawal of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined histologically at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 30-minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group (and partially also after 60 minutes), DWI abnormalities reversed transiently during the early reperfusion period but recurred after 1 day, probably due to secondary ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2.5 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, DWI abnormalities no longer reversed, and signal intensity on both DWI and T2-weighted images increased rapidly in the previously ischemic region due to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage (enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted images) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage during reperfusion was found to be predictive of relatively pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> time points and was probably related to the increased mortality rates in this experimental group (3 of 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reperfusion after short periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (30 to 60 minutes) appears to be mainly complicated by secondary ischemic damage as shown by the delayed recurrence of the DWI lesions, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage associated with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> becomes a dominant factor with longer occlusion times (2.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
