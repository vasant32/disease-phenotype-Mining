<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the physiological significance of endogenous IL-6 expression and to identify the main signal pathway for the action of IL-6, we administered anti-mouse IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (IL-6RA), which blocks IL-6 signaling, to mice immediately after a 45-min period of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 6 h after MCAO, IL-6RA administration had resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) protein in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after MCAO, blockade of IL-6 signaling had led to an increase in number of apoptotic cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and enlargement of the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and it had adversely affected neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that endogenous IL-6 plays a critical role in preventing damaged neurons from undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that its role may be mediated by Stat3 activation </plain></SENT>
