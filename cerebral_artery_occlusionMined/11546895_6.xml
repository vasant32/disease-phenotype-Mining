<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to assess the incidence and clinical significance of the intraparenchymal hyperdense areas on the posttherapeutic CT scan just after intra-arterial reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied prospectively with post-therapeutic CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperdense areas were classified into three groups: those in the lentiform nucleus, insular cortex and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence of hyperdense areas and hemorrhagic transformations and assessed whether location of hyperdense areas may play a role in the incidence of hemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated correlation between early CT signs and hyperdense areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five hyperdense areas were seen in 37 of the 77 patients (48.1%): 19 of the 45 (42.2%) were confirmed to be <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> themselves, 6 (13.4%) showed later conversion to petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and 20 (44.4%) showed rapid disappearance without hemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 37 patients (29.7%) had neurological worsening due to massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>), whereas none of the 40 patients without hyperdense areas had symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> among hyperdense areas was significantly lower in the insular cortex than in the other 2 regions (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, hyperdense areas in the lentiform nucleus had a significantly higher incidence of neurological worsening (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between early CT signs and hyperdense areas (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of hyperdense areas was a significant risk factor for severe hemorrhagic transformations, although only 29.7% of patients with hyperdense areas had symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the absence of hyperdense areas was a reliable negative predictor for symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
