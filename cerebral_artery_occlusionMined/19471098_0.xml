<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rat ventricular myocytes, the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on action potential duration (APD) and underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms were investigated by whole-cell patch clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that heart rate-corrected QT interval and APD were prolonged with frequent occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in a rat model of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The I(Na) density was overall smaller in cerebral ischemic myocytes relative to sham myocytes (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Nav1.5 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (pore-forming subunit for I(Na) ) were decreased by about 20% (P &lt; 0.01) in cerebral ischemic rat hearts than those in sham-operated rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak transient outward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current (I(to)) at +60 mV was found decreased by approximately 32.3% (P &lt; 0.01) in cerebral ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peak amplitude of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) was increased and the inactivation kinetics were slowed (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein level of the pore-forming subunit for I(to) was decreased, but that for I(Ca,L) was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current (I(K1)) at -120 mV and its protein level were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study represents the first documentation of I(Na), I(to) and I(Ca,L) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> as the major ionic mechanism for cerebral ischemic QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
