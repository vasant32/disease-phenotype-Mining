<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive male rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (in 50% O2/balance N2), and their tracheas were intubated and their lungs mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A right subtemporal craniectomy was performed and a 10-0 suture placed around the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were then randomly assigned to one of two <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one half of the rats (n = 14), the inspired <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> concentration was reduced to 0.5-0.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remainder (n = 14), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> was discontinued, and an intravenous infusion of 1% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was given in doses sufficient to produce and maintain electroencephalographic burst suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was then reversibly ligated for 2 h while pericranial temperature was maintained at 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the ligature was removed and reperfusion confirmed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were allowed to recover for 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic evaluations were performed at both 24 and 96 h postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rats were then killed and the brains removed, frozen, sectioned, and stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitro blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by computerized planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physiologic values were similar between <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> groups, although plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly greater during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> group (125 +/- 25 vs. 83 +/- 8 mg/dl, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At both 24 and 96 h postischemia, neurologic deficits were mild but without a difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurologic scores at 96 h postischemia correlated with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = 0.49, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
