<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the first evidence that another TLR, TLR9, can induce neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that the TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) can serve as a potent preconditioning stimulus and provide protection against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our studies show that systemic administration of CpG ODN 1826 in advance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)) reduces ischemic damage up to 60% in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also offer evidence that CpG ODN preconditioning can provide direct protection to cells of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, as we have found marked neuroprotection in modeled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that CpG preconditioning significantly increases serum TNFalpha levels before MCAO and that TNFalpha is required for subsequent reduction in damage, as mice lacking TNFalpha are not protected against ischemic injury by CpG preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies show that preconditioning with a TLR9 ligand induces neuroprotection against ischemic injury through a mechanism that shares common elements with LPS preconditioning via TLR4 </plain></SENT>
