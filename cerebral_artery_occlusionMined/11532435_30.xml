<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Information is lacking regarding dynamic platelet accumulation at the site of the occluded middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the relationship between platelet aggregation in downstream cerebral microvessels and loss of perfusion and vascular integrity of these microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we employed a model of embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the rat to simultaneously measure temporal and spatial profiles of platelet accumulation at the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> occluding the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and within downstream cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also measured the integrity of microvessels and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats (n=36) were subjected to embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect microvascular integrity, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and the deposition of fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE zymography was used to measure MMP2 and MMP9 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of platelets and increases in PAI-1 immunoreactivity at the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> occluding the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were detected 1 h (n=7) and 4 h (n=7) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively, and numbers of GPIIb/IIIa immunoreactive downstream cerebral microvessels increased significantly (209+/-59; n=7; P&lt;0.05) 4 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting dynamic platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant (n=7; P&lt;0.01) diffuse loss of type IV collagen immunoreactivity in microvessels was temporally associated with platelet GPIIb/IIIa immunoreactivity within the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Triple immunostaining revealed that microvessels containing platelet aggregates exhibited loss of type IV collagen immunoreactivity and both intra- and extra-vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath>, suggesting that intravascular platelet aggregation is associated with decreases in the integrity of the microvascular basal lamina and blood-brain barrier leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in MMP9 was detected at 4 h (n=3) and 24 h (n=3) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but levels of MMP2 were not significantly changed in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that dynamic platelet aggregation in ischemic brain may contribute to time-dependent resistance to fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, platelet deposition and increased MMP9 coincided with degradation of type IV collagen and loss of vascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an important role for post-occlusive distal platelet deposition in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
