<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MT-1 and -2 protect against reactive oxygen species and free radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of MT-1 and -2 using MT-1,-2 knockout (KO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MT-1,-2 KO mice exhibited greater neuronal damage after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MT-2 mRNA was significantly increased at 6, 12, and 24 h after MCAO in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mouse brain [as detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)], while MT-1 and MT-3 were decreased at 12 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an immunohistochemical study, MT expression displayed colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (astrocytes) in the penumbra area in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since erythropoietin (EPO) has been reported to induce MT-1 and -2 gene expression in vitro, we examined its effect after permanent MCAO, and explored the possible underlying mechanism by examining MT-1 and -2 induction in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, EPO significantly reduced both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and volume at 24 h after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in MT-1,-2 KO mice EPO-treatment did not alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (vs. vehicle-treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice at 6 h after EPO administration, real-time RT-PCR revealed increased MT-1 and -2 mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex (without MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, MT-1 and -2 immunoreactivity was increased in the cortex of EPO-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that MTs are induced, and may be neuroprotective against neuronal damage, after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EPO is neuroprotective in vivo during permanent MCAO, and this may be at least partly mediated by MTs </plain></SENT>
