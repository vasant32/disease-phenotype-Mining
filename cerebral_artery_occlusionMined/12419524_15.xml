<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model in Wistar rats to analyze the influence of unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0006080'>CNS ischemia</z:mp> on spleen cell number and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occlusion time was 1 h, followed by reperfusion with survival for 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels were used as an index of peripheral sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the total number of spleen cells significantly decreased after 2-28 days of survival in animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> compared to sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the percentage of CD5(+)-CD4(+) T cells, MHC class II(+) cells, or ED1(+) macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage of CD5(+)-CD8(+) T cells decreased at 2 days, resulting in an increased CD4/CD8 ratio, and both parameters returned to control levels after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-induced T and B lymphocyte proliferation increased after 0-28 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> independently of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in immune response or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels between left and right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the notion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces mobilization of certain immune cells from the periphery to the brain, where they may contribute to the local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is followed by a systemic activation of T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Absence of asymmetric effects of left versus right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and failure to demonstrate any suppressive effects of left-sided lesions on lymphocyte proliferation, probably reflects the fact that these large cerebral ischemic lesions affect both cortical and subcortical areas </plain></SENT>
