<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is a common complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and may exacerbate ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) is upregulated in the brain in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and in animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models and exerts local neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epo is also well known to stimulate red blood cell (RBC) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether poststroke systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is present in the rat model and whether it is associated with increased peripheral Epo and RBC production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats underwent 1-hour transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under mechanical ventilation, followed by reperfusion without further ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups of MCAO and sham-operated animals were evaluated at extended times after reperfusion for assessment of arterial blood gases, plasma Epo, and complete blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> group between 6 and 24 hours after reperfusion (P=0.0005), and plasma Epo levels were increased 6 hours after reperfusion (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RBC counts and hematocrit were transiently increased 2 to 7 days after reperfusion in animals with MCAO compared with sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal increases were seen at day 7 (22% and 16% increases of RBC count and hematocrit, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the white blood cell counts in animals with MCAO decreased by &gt;30% in the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Epo levels, RBC counts, and hematocrit are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased in response to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
