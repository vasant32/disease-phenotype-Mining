<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study found that cerebral <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> prolongs <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> protects against intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and whether <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> affects blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were three sets of experiments in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first set, male Sprague-Dawley rats were preconditioned with either 15 min of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, an <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus, or a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days later, rats received an infusion of autologous whole blood in the ipsilateral or contralateral caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 24 h later for brain water content measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second set, rats underwent 15 min of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> or a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three days later, rats were used for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and thrombin clotting time tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third set, the levels of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), transferrin (Tf), and transferrin receptor (TfR) in the brain 24 or 72 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> when blood was injected into the ipsilateral caudate but it did not when blood was injected into the contralateral caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> resulted in prolongation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and thrombin clotting time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> also induced the activation of p44/42 MAPKs and upregulation of HO-1, Tf, and TfR levels in the ipsilateral caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and decreases blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The protection of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> is mainly due to local factors in the brain and may be related to activation of p44/42 MAPKs and upregulation of HO-1, Tf, and TfR </plain></SENT>
