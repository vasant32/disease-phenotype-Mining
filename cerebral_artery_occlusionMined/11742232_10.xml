<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ire1-mediated signal is part of one ER signaling pathways; the signal induces the expression of an ER-resident protein, Bip/GRP78, and is thought to be involved in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined time-dependent Bip expression after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and characterized the Bip-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ire1- mediated molecules, Bip, were rapidly up-regulated in the ischemic area after 3.5 h recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their immunoreactivity continued to increase until 24-48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining revealed Bip up-regulation in ischemic neurons, which were TUNEL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that the Ire1-mediated signal might be associated with ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
