<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that honokiol, an active component of Magnolia officinalis, displayed protective effect against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (FCI/R) injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and infiltration of neutrophils to injured tissue play deleterious roles during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the mechanism(s) in mediating neuroprotective effect of honokiol, FCI/R-induced neutrophil infiltration and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in brain tissue, and activation of neutrophils in-vitro were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of honokiol (0.01-1.0 microg/kg) 15 min before (pretreatment) or 60 min after (post-treatment) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced the total infarcted volume by 20-70% in dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment or post-treatment of honokiol at concentration of 0.1 and 1.0 microg/kg significantly decreased the neutrophil infiltration in the infarcted brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time course of neutrophil infiltration was performed in parallel with the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in infracted brain tissue during FCI/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that honokiol can protect brain tissue against <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration during FCI/R injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> induced by FCI/R is accompanied with a prominent neutrophil infiltration to the infarcted area during FCI/R course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-vitro, honokiol (0.1-10 microM) significantly diminished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine</z:chebi>)- or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>)-induced neutrophil firm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, a prerequisite step behind neutrophil infiltration, and ROS production in neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium overloading activates calcium-stimulated enzymes and further exaggerates FCI/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Honokiol (0.1-10 microM) impeded the calcium influx induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> (a receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>), AlF(4)(-) (a G-protein activator) or thapsigargin (an intracellular calcium pool releaser) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the amelioration of FCI/R injury by honokiol can be attributed to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions through, at least in part, limiting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and reducing neutrophil activation/infiltration by interfering firm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, ROS production, and calcium overloading that may be primed/activated during FCI/R injury </plain></SENT>
