<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it does not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection of IGF-I has been shown to offer protection against cerebral ischemic damage in rats although this invasive method of administration may not be practical in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive intranasal (IN) delivery of IGF-I to the brain is a promising alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the therapeutic effect of IN IGF-I in rats following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 10 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO and then again 24 and 48 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intranasal dosing of 75 microg IGF-1 (225 microg total IGF-I over 48 h) significantly reduced corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by 60% vs. control (P&lt;0.01) and hemispheric swelling by 45.6% vs. control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function, assessed by the postural reflex, flexor response and adhesive tape tests, was also improved by IN IGF-I as compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates IN delivery of IGF-1 holds significant promise as a non-invasive and efficacious method of bypassing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
