<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of DMSO on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and the consequences on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham procedure or infusion of 1% DMSO, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> (230 microg/kg in 1% DMSO), or SR49059 (1 mg/kg in 1% DMSO) followed by MCAO (each group n = 10) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-dose DMSO treatment following MCAO significantly opened the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> on the ischemic side (p &lt; 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and SR49059 did not have any additional effect on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> compromise compared to DMSO (p = 1.000, p &lt; 0.957, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DMSO as a vehicle for drug administration may increase the drug concentration into the extracellular space, but since <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability is increased, it may also provide an avenue for development of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
