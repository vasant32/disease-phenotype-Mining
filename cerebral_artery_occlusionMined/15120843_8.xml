<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of proinflammatory cytokines, neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) in the spinal cord and the bladder in response to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this connection, the gene expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 in the lumbosacral spinal cord and the bladder as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction was upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the spinal cord, the immunoreactivity of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was mainly localized in the ventral horn motoneurons contralateral to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the bladder, TNF-alpha was mainly expressed in the inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of nNOS immunoreactivity as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi>-diaphorase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-d) staining in the spinal cord and bladder was also markedly increased in response to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the temporal and spatial expression of nNOS paralleled that of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no noticeable change in gene expression and immunoreactivity of SP and CGRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results have shown that cytokines and nNOS expression are elevated in areas far removed from the primary site of ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, namely, the lumbosacral spinal cord and bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This together with some neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> maybe linked to the dysfunction of the latter in a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the apparent lack of SP and CGRP changes following MCAO suggests that the two <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> are not directly involved </plain></SENT>
