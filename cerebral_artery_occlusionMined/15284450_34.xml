<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, CP from neonatal pigs was encapsulated within alginate microcapsules for in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro studies involved serum deprivation of rat embryonic cortical neurons and treatment with a range of concentrations of conditioned media from CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies, rats received a 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by intracranial transplantation of encapsulated or unencapsulated CP, empty capsules, or no transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing was conducted on days 1 to 3 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was analyzed using 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 3 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conditioned media from CP produced a significant dose-dependent protection of serum-deprived cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed secretion of GDNF, BDNF, and NGF from CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parallel in vivo studies showed that CP transplants improved behavioral performance and decreased the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both encapsulated and unencapsulated CP transplants were effective; however, more robust benefits accompanied encapsulated transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to demonstrate the neuroprotective potential of transplanted CP and raise the intriguing possibility of using these cells as part of the treatment regimen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
