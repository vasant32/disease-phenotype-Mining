<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous work demonstrates that physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the young and aging brain through actions involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (ERs) and alterations in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major goal of this study was to establish mechanisms of neuroprotective actions induced by low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first examined effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> on the time-dependent evolution of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> is known to influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we hypothesized that it acts to decrease the delayed phase of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> observed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because ERs are pivotal to neuroprotection, we examined the temporal expression profiles of both ER subtypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, after MCAO and delineated potential roles for each receptor in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We quantified cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in brains at various times after MCAO and analyzed ER expression by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that during the first 24 h, the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection after MCAO are limited to attenuation of delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and do not influence immediate cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we discovered that ERs exhibit distinctly divergent profiles of expression over the evolution of injury, with ERalpha induction occurring early and ERbeta modulation occurring later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide evidence for a new and functional role for ERalpha in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-mediated protection of the injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protect against delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like injury through mechanisms requiring ERalpha </plain></SENT>
