<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, measurements of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> using 'diffusion weighted' MRI, is being used in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies, as a 'surrogate' end point for neuroprotective drug trials, including studies with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not fully understood to what extent <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor activation is related to 'cytotoxic' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and thus, to what degree apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) changes, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging with 'ACD mapping', represent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study this relationship, four cats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> formation was investigated using MRI with 'ACD mapping', while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation was simultaneously detected in the same animals, using radio labeled 125IodoMK-801, which binds only in activated and open <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5 h post-occlusion, a large area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> could be found with significantly lower <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the core and penumbral area of the ischemic lesion when compared to contralateral values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On corresponding sections of the feline brains, increased 125I-MK-801 binding was found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant topographical correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and measured radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there is not a significant linkage between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation and 'cytotoxic' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
