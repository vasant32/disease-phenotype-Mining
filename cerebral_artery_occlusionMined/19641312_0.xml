<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Triflusal is a 4-fluoromethyl derivative of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> used for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental data (permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats) have shown a possible role of triflusal in neuroprotection through inhibition of inflammatory pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To explore whether triflusal may modulate those pathways in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, evolution of several <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers (pro-inflammatory, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, chemokines, metalloproteinases, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related biomarkers) and neurological outcome were evaluated at baseline, and at days 1, 3, 7 and 90 in a pilot study in which 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were randomly allocated to receive triflusal or aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in IL-6 level was found in the aspirin group when compared to the triflusal group at the third and seventh day (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FGF-basic level was significantly increased at days 1 and 90 in the triflusal group (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The triflusal group also had higher levels of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta (p &lt; 0.05) at day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also among triflusal-treated patients, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TARC levels were increased as compared with the aspirin group at day 90 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some of those markers modified by triflusal (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and IL-6) were associated with neurological outcome: higher <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 measured at day 3 among patients who improve at day 7 [462.3 (419.2-735.2) vs. 285 (242.1-428.2), p &lt; 0.05], and lower levels of IL-6 at day 3 among patients who improve at day 90 [24.8 (5.6-77.3) vs. 5.4 (2.0-13.8), p &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Triflusal modulates additional mechanisms to those of aspirin [pro-inflammatory (IL-6) and chemokine (MIP-1 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) pathways] that could participate in the ischemic damage process following human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
