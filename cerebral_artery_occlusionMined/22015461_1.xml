<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group is interested in the protective effects of neuropeptides for alleviating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, as well as the underlying mechanisms of their action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was initiated to investigate molecular responses at the level of gene expression in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, we used a mouse permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) model in combination with high-throughput DNA microarray analysis on an Agilent microarray platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the right (ipsilateral) and left (contralateral) hemispheres of PMCAO model mice were dissected at two time points, 6 and 24 hours post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the ischemic (ipsilateral) hemisphere was subjected to DNA microarray analysis on a mouse whole genome 4x44K DNA chip using a dye-swap approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional categorization using the gene ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>, MGD/AMIGO) of numerous changed genes revealed expression pattern changes in the major categories of cellular process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process, metabolic process and response to stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis on randomly selected highly up- or downregulated genes validated, in general, the microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using two time points for this analysis, major and minor trends in gene expression and/or functions were observed in relation to early- and late-response genes and differentially regulated genes that were further classified into specific pathways or <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also examined the expression of these genes in the contralateral hemisphere, which suggested the presence of bilateral effects and/or differential regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related transcriptome analysis of the mouse brain, laying a strong foundation for studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms regulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to explore the neuroprotective effects of agents such as target neuropeptides </plain></SENT>
