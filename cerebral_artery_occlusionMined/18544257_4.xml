<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effect and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> effect of 9 and 18 hour hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (HBOT) protocols on the earliest stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The permanent MCAO model of rats was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly divided into 9 and 18 hour HBOT groups, as well as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) The Garcia neurological grading system was used to assess the therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy; (2) the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated with the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) pathologic staining and NIH Image J software 24 and 120 hours after MCAO; (3) the level of reactive oxygen species determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in ischemic brain tissue were separately examined at the 18, 48 and 120 hour post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time points using spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) There were significant improvements in the neurobehavioral outcome of the rats in the 9 and the 18 hour groups, as compared with rats from the control group (p&lt;0.01); (2) cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume decreased 63-64% in the rats of 9 hour group and 51-66% in the 18 hour group at the 24 and 120 hour time points, as compared with that of the control group; (3) the SOD levels of the 9 and 18 hour groups were remarkably lower than those of control group after both 18 and 48 hours (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05); (4) the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level of the 9 and 18 hour groups were both remarkably lower than the control groups, especially at 18 hours (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level in the 9 hour group was remarkably lower than both the 18 hour group and the control group (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05); (5) the level of NO in both hyperbaric oxygenation therapy groups were remarkably higher than that of the control at 18 and 48 hour time points (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the level in 18 hour group was remarkably lower than that of 9 hour group at 18 hour time point (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the 120 hour mark, the NO levels were basically the same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The two protocols of large dose hyperbaric oxygenation therapy are highly efficient in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improving neurobehavioral outcome in permanent MCAO rats within the earliest stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) increased duration of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy does not appear to equate to improved outcomes; in fact, the longer duration may aggravate the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
