<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) represent an investigational treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the relevance of vasoactive mediators, generated in response to MNC injection, as factors regulating cerebral perfusion (CP), the biodistribution of MNC, and outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Long Evans rats underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MNC were extracted from the bone marrow at 22 hrs and injected via the internal carotid artery or the femoral vein 2 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CP was measured with MRI or continuous laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected to measure vasoactive mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with the Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">Oxide</z:chebi> (NO) inhibitor, L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, to establish the relevance of NO-signaling to the effect of MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesion size, MNC biodistribution, and neurological deficits were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CP transiently increased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region within 30 min after injecting MNC compared to saline or fibroblast control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This CP increase corresponded temporarily to serum NO elevation and was abolished by L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> reduced brain penetration of MNC and prevented MNC from reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion size and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NO generation in response to MNC may represent a mechanism underlying how MNC enter the brain, reduce lesion size, and improve outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
