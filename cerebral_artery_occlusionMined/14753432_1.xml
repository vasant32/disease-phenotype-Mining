<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of NG2 positive cells increased in the ischemic penumbra at 3 and 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 7 day, the number of NG2 positive cells was significantly greater in the young than the aged brains, and the processes of NG2 positive cells enlarged and were more highly branched in the young than the aged brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the young brain shows a higher potential of proliferation and process branching of OPCs than the aged brain </plain></SENT>
