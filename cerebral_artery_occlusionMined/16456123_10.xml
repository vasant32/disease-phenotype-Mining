<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>-) on pressure-induced myogenic activity and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) actin of isolated posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histochemical staining of nitrotyrosine (NT) was used to demonstrate the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- in the cerebrovasculature after 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 30 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- on pressure-induced myogenic activity, third-order <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> from nonischemic animals were isolated and mounted in an arteriograph chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameter in response to changes in pressure was determined in the absence and presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Filamentous actin (F-actin) and globular actin (G-actin) were quantified using confocal microscopy in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> with and without exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NT staining of vascular cells was greater in ischemic brain versus sham animals (56+/-3% versus 35+/-3%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- (&lt; or =10(-6) mol/L) to isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> caused constriction from 129+/-16 microm to 115+/-15 microm (P&lt;0.01), whereas concentrations &gt;10(-6) mol/L caused dilation of spontaneous tone and loss of myogenic activity in the physiological range of 50 to 125 mm Hg, increasing diameter from 130+/-6 to 201+/-5 microm at 75 mm Hg (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the diminished myogenic activity was associated with a 4.5-fold decrease in F-actin content of VSM and a 27% increase in G-actin content (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- affects the myogenic activity of cerebral arteries and causes F-actin depolymerization in VSM, a consequence that could promote vascular damage during reperfusion injury and further brain injury </plain></SENT>
