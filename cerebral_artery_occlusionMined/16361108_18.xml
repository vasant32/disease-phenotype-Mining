<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of EE and spatial learning on neurogenesis following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male adult SD rats were subjected to sham surgery or distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO induced a transient increase followed by a sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of progenitor cell proliferation and neuroblast production below baseline level in both ipsilateral and contralateral DG compared to sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis in the DG were observed in both sham and MCAO rats following 8 weeks in the EE combined with spatial learning, compared to rats housed in the standard environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EE/Learning also restored the total number of neuroblasts in the DG after MCAO compared to sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EE/learning enhanced the density of NeuN positive cells in the ischemic penumbra, though no new neurons were detected in this region </plain></SENT>
