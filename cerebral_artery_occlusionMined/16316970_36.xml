<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase inhibitors) promote vascular thrombolysis and reduce the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the neuroprotective effects of a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and delayed rht-PA treatment in a rat model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in combination with rht-PA 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging measurements revealed that combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and rht-PA blocked the expansion of the ischemic lesion, which improved neurological function compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of single endothelial cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection from brain tissue and immunostaining showed that combination treatment downregulated expression of tissue factor, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and enhanced microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment did not increase cerebrovascular endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) levels or eNOS activity, and inhibition of NOS activity with N-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> did not block the beneficial effects of combination treatment on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, combination treatment compared with thrombolytic monotherapy increased cerebral blood flow and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in eNOS-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and rht-PA exerts a neuroprotective effect when administered 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that the therapeutic benefits are likely attributed to its multitargeted effects on cerebrovascular patency and integrity </plain></SENT>
