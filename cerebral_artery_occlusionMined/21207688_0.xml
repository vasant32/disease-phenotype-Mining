<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty eight rats were randomly divided into 6 groups that were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), and pretreatment, pre + posttreatment, posttreatment with PROG, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEXA) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established in rats by reversible inserting a nylon thread into the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were decapitated at 24 hours after the left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) respectively, and then brain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> contents were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the result in DMSO group, the content of water (P &lt; 0.01), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) was significantly reduced, but K+ (P &lt; 0.01) was obviously elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> cortex in pretreatment group or pre + posttreatment group with PROG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also significant reduction in water (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01), but was not significantly changed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> (P &gt; 0.05) and K+ (P &gt; 0.05) in posttreatment group with PROG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes occurring in DEXA group were similar to those found in pretreatment group or pre + posttreatment group with PROG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pretreatment or pretreatment plus posttreatment with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> can significantly reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in I/R </plain></SENT>
