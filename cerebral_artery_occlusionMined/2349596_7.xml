<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recorded regional cerebral blood flow, somatosensory evoked potentials, and auditory evoked potentials in the thalamic relay nuclei (ventral posterior lateral nucleus and medial geniculate body) and in the somatosensory and auditory cortices during and after 1 hour of transient left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in nine cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was also measured in the thalamocortical tracts of five of these cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the integrity of thalamocortical connections was tested by retrograde labeling of the thalamic nuclei with horseradish peroxidase in eight cats (three of which experienced no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was severely reduced during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the left primary auditory cortex (8.5 ml/100 g/min) and in white matter pathways (6.4-7.6 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, regional cerebral blood flow did not change significantly in the somatosensory cortex or in either thalamic nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evoked potentials were abolished in both cortices but remained unchanged in the thalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials disappeared 5-8 minutes later than auditory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recirculation after 1 hour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in rapid and almost complete recovery (94%) of somatosensory evoked potentials and little recovery (18.4%) of auditory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in the auditory pathway both cortical and fiber tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are (perhaps synergistically) responsible for dysfunction, while in the somatosensory cortex evoked potentials are abolished due to white matter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The delayed disappearance and better recovery of somatosensory than of auditory evoked potentials indicate that ischemic tolerance is higher in fiber tracts than in cortex </plain></SENT>
