<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral ischemic brain, sustained and regulated suppression of HMGB1 has been emerged as a therapeutic means to grant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 consists of two HMG boxes (A and B) and an acidic C-terminal tail, and the A box <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antagonistically competes with HMGB1 for its receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats, a murine model of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, administration of HMGB1 A box intraparenchymally, after encapsulated in biodegradable gelatin microspheres (GMS), which enhances the stability of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inside and allows its sustained delivery, at 1 h, 3 h, or 6 h after MCAO, reduced mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by, respectively, 81.3%, 42.6% and 30.7% of the untreated MCAO-brain, along with remarkable improvement of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the administration of HMGB1 A box/GMS suppressed proinflammatory cytokine inductions more strongly than the injection of non-encapsulated HMGB1 A box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given that insulted brains-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have enhanced gelatinase activity than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, our results suggest that GMS-mediated delivery of therapeutic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> is a promising means to provide efficient neuroprotection in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
