<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) enhance neurological recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rodents, possibly via induction of growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore elected to test the effects of hMSC treatment on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which plays an important role in growth, development, neuroprotection and repair in the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats (n=57) were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and injected intravenously with 3 x 10(6) hMSCs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1 day after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was measured after MCAo using a modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in the ischemic brain tissue were measured at 2 and 7 days after MCAo using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (DCX), IGF-1 and IGF-1R at 7, 14 and 30 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of MCAo with hMSCs significantly improved functional recovery from 14 to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAB1281-labeled hMSCs entered the ischemic brain and increased time-dependently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hMSC treatment significantly increased IGF-1 mRNA and BrdU(+), DCX(+), IGF-1(+) and IGF-1R(+) cells compared to PBS-treated rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of BrdU(+) or DCX(+) cells colocalized with IGF-1 increased in the hMSC-treated rats compared to the PBS-treated rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 and IGF-1R may contribute to improved functional recovery and increased neurogenesis after treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with hMSCs </plain></SENT>
