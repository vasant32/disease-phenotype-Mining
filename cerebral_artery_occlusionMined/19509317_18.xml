<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical research suggests that systemically administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> prevents and treats <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, translation into human trials has been limited, probably because of difficulties with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A noninvasive method of intranasal administration has emerged recently as a rapid way to bypass the blood-brain barrier and target therapeutic agents to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that intranasal administration targets <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> to the brain and reduces systemic exposure, and that intranasal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> prevents and treats <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 6-mg dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> resulted in significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> concentrations in the brain (0.9-18.5 microM) at 30 min after intranasal administration than after intravenous administration (0.1-0.5 microM, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to blood concentration, intranasal delivery increased targeting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> to the cortex approximately 200-fold compared with intravenous delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration of three 6-mg doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> did not result in clinically significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with intranasal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (three 6-mg doses) 48 h before MCAO significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 55% versus control (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, post-treatment with intranasal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (six 6-mg doses) immediately after reperfusion significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 55% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These experiments suggest that intranasally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> may be a useful treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and a prophylactic for patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
