<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> play an important role in the exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of DSCR1 in the mouse cortex after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, in vitro studies were taken to address whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> could induce DSCR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to transient MCAO for 35 min and sacrificed at 6, 24, and 72 h after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of DSCR1 began to increase in layer VI of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex at 24 h and was prominently enhanced at 72h after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry showed that the induction of the DSCR1 isoform 4 (DSCR1-4) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> preceded the expression of the DSCR1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were found to induce strong upregulation of DSCR1-4 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that overexpression of DSCR1-4 in SK-N-SH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells attenuated IL-1beta-induced cyclooxygenase 2 and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate upregulation of DSCR1 in the mouse peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex following transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> such as TNFalpha and IL-1beta can induce DSCR1-4 transcription, which may be associated with the alleviation of inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
