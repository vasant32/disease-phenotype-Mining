<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr was administered as three bolus injections (30 or 90 mg/kg, i.p.) starting at 30, 90, and 180 min after ET-1 administration or as a single bolus (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min prior to PTZ administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were estimated 3 days after ET-1 administration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> score was assessed during the first 20 min after PTZ administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety of 3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr was evaluated in control animals using telemetry to measure cardiovascular parameters and immunostaining to assess the level of activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr significantly improved neurological function and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the brain even when the treatment was initiated 3 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr significantly depressed PTZ-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr did not cause significant changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate and spontaneous locomotor activity, nor did it increase the number of activated caspase-3 positive cells in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 3,5-DBr-D: -Tyr, by alleviating the deleterious effects of MCAo and PTZ in rats with no obvious intrinsic effects on cardiovascular parameters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, exhibits promising potential as a novel therapeutic direction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
