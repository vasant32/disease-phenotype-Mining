<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neutrophils are critically involved with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury in many tissues but have not been studied under conditions of reperfusion after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies were conducted to confirm our previous observations quantifying neutrophils in rat permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using a myeloperoxidase activity assay and to extend them to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> receptor binding in ischemic tissue was evaluated as a potential marker for inflammatory cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histological, enzymatic, and receptor binding techniques were used to evaluate neutrophil infiltration and receptor binding in infarcted cortical tissue 24 hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 25) or temporary occlusion for 80 (n = 12) or 160 (n = 22) minutes followed by reperfusion for 24 hours in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sham surgery (n = 26) produced no changes in any parameter measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, neutrophil accumulation was observed histologically, but the infiltration was moderate and typically within and adjacent to blood vessels bordering the infarcted cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion, marked neutrophil infiltration was observed throughout the infarcted cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activity was increased (p less than 0.05) after permanent occlusion and to a greater extent after temporary occlusion with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activity (units per gram wet weight) in ischemic cortex was increased over that in nonischemic (control) cortex 32.2-fold, 54.6-fold, and 92.1-fold for permanent occlusion and 80 and 160 minutes of temporary occlusion with reperfusion, respectively (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sham surgery produced no changes in myeloperoxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">Leukotriene B4</z:chebi> receptor binding also was increased (p less than 0.05) after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and paralleled the increases in myeloperoxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ischemic cortex-specific receptor binding (femtomoles per milligram protein) was 3.87 +/- 0.63 in sham-operated rats and 4.57 +/- 0.98, 8.98 +/- 1.11, and 11.12 +/- 1.63 for rats subjected to permanent occlusion and 80 and 160 minutes of temporary occlusion with reperfusion, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p less than 0.05 different from sham-operated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cortical myeloperoxidase activity was significantly correlated with the degree of cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> receptor binding (r = 0.66 and r = 0.79 in two different studies, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that neutrophils are involved in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that there is a dramatic accumulation of neutrophils in infarcted tissue during reperfusion that can be quantified using the myeloperoxidase activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">Leukotriene B4</z:chebi> receptor binding increases in infarcted tissue in a parallel manner, which suggests that the increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> binding is to receptors located on the accumulating neutrophils </plain></SENT>
