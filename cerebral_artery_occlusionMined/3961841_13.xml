<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusion was reversed to allow reperfusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> after 2 min to 24 hr of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cats had temporary occlusions lasting 2 min to 3 hr; their neurological deficits improved or resolved after reperfusion, and brain sections showed only scattered microscopic areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 4-hr occlusion, five of nine cats (55%) recovered completely within 24 hr; two had persistent deficit when sacrificed, 10 days later, and each had a circumscribed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 cats undergoing 5-, 6-, 8-, and 24-hr occlusions sustained permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three 3-hr occlusions at 2-day intervals in three cats resulted in permanent deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were 25% larger than those after single 8-hr occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten cats underwent permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; three deteriorated neurologically and died, and the survivors showed no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> after 5-, 6-, and 8-hr occlusions followed by reperfusion were 66% smaller (p less than 0.05) than those after permanent occlusion; reperfusion after 24 hr of occlusion did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction occurred after two permanent occlusions, but after only one 5-hr temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results obtained with this method of temporary regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> indicate that restoration of flow after 1-8 hr, but not after 24 hr, of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in less severe neurological deficit and smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than did permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size correlated with the duration of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (p less than 0.05) rather than with the degree of deficit during occlusion </plain></SENT>
