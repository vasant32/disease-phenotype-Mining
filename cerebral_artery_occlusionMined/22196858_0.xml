<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Exogenous human albumin has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and it is currently investigated in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of endogenous expression of albumin and its transcriptional regulation in the ischemic brain is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the upregulation of de novo synthesis of albumin in the ischemic rat brain (at 0 and 22 hours of reperfusion after 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the role of transcription factors in albumin expression in ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The putative transcription factor binding sites for the albumin promoter was analyzed using transcription factor search computational tool and validated in rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computational analysis predicted approximately 20 transcription factor binding sites including hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found for the first time <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of HNF-1alpha in the control and ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of HNF-1alpha between control and ischemic (0, 2 and 22 hours of reperfusion) group but there was increased interaction of HNF-1alpha with p300 (known interacting partner for HNF-1alpha, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-transferase) in 0- and 22-hour reperfusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also albumin promoter binding activity of HNF-1alpha in ischemic animals of 0- and 22-hour reperfusion groups significantly increased compared to respective control group animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Although, HNF-1alpha is mainly expressed in the rat liver and involved in hepatic expression of albumin, our study conclusively shows for the first time de novo synthesis of HNF-1alpha in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an increased interaction of HNF-1alpha with p300 and albumin promoter seems to be responsible for overexpression of albumin in ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
