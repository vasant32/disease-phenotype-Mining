<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that dysfunction of NCAM is linked to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NCAM is one of the proteolysis targets of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), whose activation is implicated in neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate the involvement of MMP-mediated proteolysis of NCAM in the development of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male ddY and MMP-9 knockout (KO) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In MCAO model mice, development of infarction and behavioral abnormality were clearly observed on days 1 and 3 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly increased on days 1 and 3 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, full-length NCAM (180 kDa) was significantly decreased, but its metabolite levels increased on day 1 by ischemic stress per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NCAM small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> significantly increased the neuronal damage induced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP inhibition or MMP-9 gene KO attenuated the infarction, behavioral abnormalities, and decrease of NCAM (180 kDa) observed after MCAO in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present findings clearly suggest that MMP-2/MMP-9-mediated NCAM proteolysis is implicated in the exacerbation of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
