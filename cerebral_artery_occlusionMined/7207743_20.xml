<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was achieved by external compression with an implantable, inflatable balloon cuff in awake, unanesthetized baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral angiography confirmed consistent, reliable occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography demonstrated early density changes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which were reversible with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation demonstrated a "recruitment response" of increasingly persistent deficit with repeated occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent deficits were noted after extensive angiography during periods of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by the dropout of small vessels in the middle cerebral artery distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of pathological examinations were consistent with the clinical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No gross or microscopic changes were noted after repeated occlusions that caused deficits like those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent infarctions were noted in animals with permanent deficits after permanent occlusion or after repeated occlusion and extensive angiography </plain></SENT>
