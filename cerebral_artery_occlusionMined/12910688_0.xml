<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ischemic tolerance induced by focal ischemic preconditioning (PC) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(MCAO) was used for PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different duration of reperfusion (1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days) was allowed before 2 hours of MCAO followed by 22 hours of reperfusion in SD rats that were divided into the PC group and the PC plus MCAO group, and were compared with the rats of sham-operation plus MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, brain water content and HE staining were evaluated in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PC produced no neurological deficits and TTC-demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PC reduced neurological deficits significantly caused by 2 h MCAO 1-28 days after PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced only if PC was performed 1-14 days before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PC given 3 days before MCAO also decreased brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ten minutes of MCAO was strong enough to induce ischemic tolerance without brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction appeared at 1 day and did not vanish until 14 days after PC, but protection against neurological impairment existed at least 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
