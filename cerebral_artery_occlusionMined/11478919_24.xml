<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been reported that a spin trap nitrone, alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> nitrone (PBN), can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in rats subjected to either permanent or transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent study has demonstrated that NXY-059, a novel free radical trapping nitrone compound, has a neuroprotective effect against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the effect of NXY-059 in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by placement of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysm</z:e> clip on the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into three groups: (1) physiological saline given as a 1 ml/kg i.v. bolus administered 5 min post MCAO followed immediately by a continuous i.v. infusion of 0.5 ml/h of physiological saline for 24 h (n=10); (2) 30 mg/kg, 1 ml/kg, i.v. bolus of NXY-059 dissolved in physiological saline administered 5 min post MCAO followed immediately by a continuous i.v. infusion of 30 mg/kg/h, 0.5 ml/h, of NXY-059 for 24 h (n=9); (3) 60 mg/kg, 1 ml/kg, i.v. bolus of NXY-059 dissolved in physiological saline administered 5 min post MCAO followed immediately by a continuous i.v. infusion of 60 mg/kg/h, 0.5 ml/h, of NXY-059 for 24 h (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarction was quantified after a survival period of 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were examined with one-way ANOVA following Dunnet's multiple comparison test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cortical infarction in the saline control group was 22.6 +/- 6.8% (mean+/-S.D.) of contra-lateral hemisphere, and in the 30 mg/kg/h NXY-059-treated group was 17.4% +/- 6.8% (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration (microM/l) of NXY-059 in the 30 mg/kg/h group was 80.2 +/- 52.2 (n=9), while in the 60 mg/kg/h group plasma concentration (microM/l) of NXY-059 was 391.0 +/- 207.0 (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infarction in the 60 mg/kg/h NXY-059-treated group was significantly reduced (P=0.009) to 14.5 +/- 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary data demonstrate that administration of NXY-059 (60 mg/kg/h for 24 h) ameliorates cortical infarction in rats subjected to permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with 24 h survival </plain></SENT>
