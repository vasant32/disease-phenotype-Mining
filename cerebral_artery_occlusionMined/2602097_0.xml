<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of the ten patients had cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, one had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, and the remaining one had no significant abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by the 1.5 Tesla SIGNA (GE), using spin-echo pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> could be detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> occluded arteries showed absence of flow void and were demonstrated as iso- or hyperintense structures relative to gray matter on T1-weighted images, iso- or hypointense on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight of the ten patients, absence of flow void in the sylvian fissure was observed on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, MRI was proved to be a pertinent diagnostic modality for evaluating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
