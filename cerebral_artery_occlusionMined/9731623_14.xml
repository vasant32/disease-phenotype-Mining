<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> is associated with a marked increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results in activation of cell surface <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptors and some degree of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> kinase is a key enzyme controlling <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of this enzyme enhances the levels of endogenous brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> already elevated as a result of the ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied a novel <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> kinase inhibitor (AKI), GP683, in a rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of 10 adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90 minutes of temporary middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, or 2.0 mg/kg of GP683 30, 150, and 270 minutes after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by a researcher blinded to treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The animals were euthanatized 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and brains were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We measured brain temperatures in a separate group of 6 rats before and after administration of 1.0 mg/kg GP683 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treated groups showed a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, but a significant effect was observed only in the 1.0 mg/kg-dose group (44% reduction, P=0.0077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body weight, physiological parameters, neurological scores, and mortality did not differ among the 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No apparent behavioral side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brain temperatures did not change after drug injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the use of AKIs offers therapeutic potential and may represent a novel approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect observed was not caused by a decrease in brain temperature </plain></SENT>
