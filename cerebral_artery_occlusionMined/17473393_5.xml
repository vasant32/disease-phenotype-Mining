<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrolysin, a preparation derived from porcine brain, contains a mixture of neurotrophic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of Cerebrolysin in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrolysin (1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 ml/kg) was administered once daily intraperitoneally for 21 days, starting 24 hours after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mature rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Enhancement of sensorimotor recovery, as assessed by forelimb and hindlimb placing and body swing tests, was seen with Cerebrolysin treatment, especially at the 2.5 ml/kg dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this dose, enhanced recovery was found when Cerebrolysin treatment was begun at 24 or 48 (but not 72 hours) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no effects on body weight or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when Cerebrolysin was administered in this manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Cerebrolysin may be a useful treatment for enhancing neurological recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
