<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of i.v.-injected human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) on neurologic functional deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and IV injected with 3 x 10(6) hMSC 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was measured before and 1, 7, and 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mixed lymphocyte reaction and the development of cytotoxic T lymphocytes measured the immune rejection of hMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody specific to human cellular nuclei (mAb1281) was used to identify hMSC and to measure neural phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ELISA analyzed neurotrophin levels in cerebral tissue from hMSC-treated or nontreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine injections were used to identify newly formed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant recovery of function was found in rats treated with hMSC at 14 days compared with control rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Few (1 to 5%) hMSC expressed proteins phenotypic of brain parenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor significantly increased, and apoptotic cells significantly decreased in the ischemic boundary zone; significantly more bromodeoxyuridine-reactive cells were detected in the subventricular zone of the ischemic hemisphere of rats treated with hMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>hMSC induced proliferation of lymphocytes without the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurologic benefit resulting from hMSC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats may derive from the increase of growth factors in the ischemic tissue, the reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the penumbral zone of the lesion, and the proliferation of endogenous cells in the subventricular zone </plain></SENT>
