<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied histopathologic changes in cerebral cortex of 20 rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by using the Fink-Heimer suppressive silver impregnation method and conventional stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 6 hours after occlusion, Fink-Heimer-stained sections revealed abundant coarsely granular, intensely argyrophilic neurons in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These distinctive argyrophilic neurons could be clearly differentiated from neurons that suffered postmortem changes; argyrophilic neurons were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the lateral parietal cortex but in only the superficial cortical layers II and III in the parasagittal area of the frontoparietal cortex and the temporo-occipital area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after occlusion as the ischemic region progressed to pannecrosis, argyrophilic neurons were still evident in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, with more prominent neuritic silver deposits but no changes in number or spatial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 2-7 days, the argyrophilic neurons gradually disappeared while many fine silver-impregnated degenerating terminals appeared in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3-6 weeks after occlusion, no more argyrophilic neurons were seen in the cortex although degenerating axons were still present in the deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate selective neuronal damage in the superficial cortical layers and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> in the cerebrum surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuronal damage does not appear to progress beyond 6 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Fink-Heimer method has many advantages over existing conventional stains for documenting selective neuronal damage in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
