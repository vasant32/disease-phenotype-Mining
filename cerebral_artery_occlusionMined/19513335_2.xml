<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old woman with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> syndrome admitted to the emergency room within intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her neurological symptoms improved during thrombolysis, but chest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated history-taking, physical examination, and imaging studies led to the timely diagnosis and surgical treatment of AoD, which produced a successful outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion is invaluable for the diagnosis of this rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism and complications, the risks of thrombolysis might outweigh its benefits </plain></SENT>
