<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date murine models of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this paper were to compare three different permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) models with or without craniectomy, and to identify an ideal mouse model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiments were performed on 45 healthy adult male Kunming mice, weighing 28 to 42 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 15 in every group) based on surgical procedure: MCAo via the external carotid artery (ECA), MCAo via the common carotid artery (CCA), and direct ligation of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each day post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals were scored using an eight-grade neurological function scale, and mortality was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the brains were removed for lesion size determination using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis of lesion volume and neurological score was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality in the group receiving direct <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation was lowest among the three groups, and there was a significant difference between the direct <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation group and the two intraluminal occlusion groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, neurological scores gradually increased with prolongation of ischemic duration, peaking after two days, then gradually decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the direct <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation group, however, neurological scores were relatively stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological score 7 days after MCAo in every group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r &gt; 0.7, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting good reproducibility of lesion volume in the three groups, but the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was more constant in the direct <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The direct ligation model of MCAo provides an optimal means of studying permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and is preferable to the models using intraluminal sutures </plain></SENT>
