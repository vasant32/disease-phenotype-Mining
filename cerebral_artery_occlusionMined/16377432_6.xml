<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in these studies the histological changes and not the functional consequences of the brain damage were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of present investigation was to analyze the sensorimotor function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to test the influence of talampanel (GYKI-53773, LY-300164) by 30-day monitoring in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) general 'well-being', neurological status, spontaneous motor activity, rotation, motor coordination, balancing, muscle strength and reaction time were followed for 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Talampanel (6 x 10 mg/kg i.p. given on the day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) improved the motor coordination in rotarod (p &lt; 0.01) and beam walking (p &lt; 0.01) tests, reduced the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced rotations (p &lt; 0.05), shortened the reflex time on the forelimb contralateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and improved the survival rate comparing with vehicle treated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, serious sensorimotor deficits appeared in rats but they showed partial spontaneous recovery after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Talampanel treatment enhanced the rate of functional improvement without changing the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that modulation of AMPA receptors by talampanel can be a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
