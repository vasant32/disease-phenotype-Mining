<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pain (CPSP) is a complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, and is characterized clinically by spontaneous pain and attacks of <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> and dysaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanisms of CPSP are not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we have examined alterations of the current stimulus threshold of primary afferent neurons or the nociceptive threshold against mechanical stimuli in mice receiving left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Alterations of current stimulus threshold and the development of mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> in hind paws were measured after MCAO using a Neurometer and the von Frey filament test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was clearly observed on day 1 and day 3 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the estimation of current stimulus threshold measured by the Neurometer, the sensitivity of Aδ and Aβ fibres (at 2000 and 250 Hz stimulation, respectively) was significantly increased on day 3 after MCAO, while that of C fibres (at 5 Hz stimulation) was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the paw withdrawal threshold of the left hind paw as measured by the von Frey filament test was significantly decreased on day 1 and day 3 after MCAO when compared with day 0, while that in the right hind paw was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggested the development of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100963'>hyperaesthesia</z:hpo> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> developed in the ipsilateral side to the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potentially, myelinated A fibre-specific hypersensitization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may have contributed to these symptoms </plain></SENT>
