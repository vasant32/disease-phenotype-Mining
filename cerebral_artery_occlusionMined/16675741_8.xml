<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) hypointensities are MRI features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DWI alterations during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> recover with early reperfusion, but they can reappear later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pronounced signal abnormalities early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are associated with infarction, but the significance of subtle changes is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluated the degree and time course of regional signal intensity changes during the first 24 hours of reperfusion after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, and we related them to the progression of the histopathological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats (n=54) were subjected to 1-hour intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to assess the dynamics of MRI signal intensity changes during the initial 24 hours and their correspondent histopathological features: 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and immunoreactivity to 70-kDa heat shock protein and to astroglial and microglial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused early striatal infarction but delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The striatum showed marked MRI changes from 4 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 12 hours, the striatal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> signal intensity ratio to the homologous contralateral region was 30% reduced, and the TTC staining evidenced infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrarily, the cortical <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio was only 15% reduced, and TTC staining was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After this time, the cortex showed sudden and pronounced (&gt;30%) <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> signal intensity changes coincidentally with the manifestation of infarction, accompanied with severe vacuolation and unambiguous signs of neuronal and astroglial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that minor changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> signal intensity early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> should not be underestimated because they may be harbingers of delayed infarction </plain></SENT>
