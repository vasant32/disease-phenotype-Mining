<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that high-concentration albumin therapy is markedly neuroprotective in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to ascertain the degree to which hemodynamic alterations are responsible for this therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normothermic, physiologically regulated male Sprague-Dawley rats received a 2-h period of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by insertion of an intraluminal suture coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Albumin (25% human serum albumin solution) or vehicle (0.9% <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi>) was administered intravenously at a dose of 1% of body weight immediately after suture withdrawal following 2-h MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured autoradiographically with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine after 1 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Novel image-processing methods were used to compare average LCBF data sets against previously obtained infarction-frequency data on a pixel-by-pixel basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Albumin therapy reduced mean hematocrit by 42% but produced no other systemic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pixel-based histopathological analysis revealed large, consistent cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in saline-treated rats with MCAo; albumin therapy reduced mean cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within regions showing albumin-associated neuroprotection, numbers of pixels having LCBF in the upper ischemic-core flow range (0.12-0.24 ml g-1 min-1) were reduced by 8.6-fold by albumin therapy when compared to saline-treated rats; and numbers of pixels with LCBF in the lower penumbral flow range (0.24-0.36 ml g-1 min-1) were reduced by 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1-fold in albumin-treated rats (p=0.04 by repeated-measures analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the [albumin-saline] 3-dimensional difference-image data set revealed a circumferential zone of statistically significant albumin-associated LCBF increase within the posterior portion of the ischemic hemisphere, surrounding the core-region of prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, high-concentration albumin therapy improves local perfusion to regions of critical LCBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The spatial extent of this LCBF effect, however, appears too small to account fully for the marked neuroprotective efficacy of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that other, non-hemodynamic mechanisms may also be contributory </plain></SENT>
