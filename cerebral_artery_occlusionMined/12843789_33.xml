<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and subsequently were exposed to HBO (2.5 atmospheres absolute) for 2 h, at 6 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed and brain samples were collected at 24, 48, 72 h, and 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits, infarction area, and apoptotic changes were evaluated by clinical scores, 2,3,7-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, caspase-3 expression, DNA fragmentation assay, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16450">2'-deoxyuridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) costaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In MCAO/R without HBO treatment animals, DNA fragmentation was observed in injured cortex at 24, 48, and 72 h but not in samples at 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double labeling of brain slides with NeuN and caspase-3 demonstrated neurons in the injured cortex labeled with caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TUNEL+H&amp;E costaining revealed morphologic apoptotic changes at 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and improved neurologic scores at 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the molecular mechanisms of HBO-induced brain protection is to prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and this effect of HBO might preserve more brain tissues and promote neurologic functional recovery </plain></SENT>
