<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an experimental approach to evaluate the possible beneficial effects of administration of neurotrophic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we have used a model of distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this model, we found: (1) a permanent reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its full-length receptor, TrkB, in the infarcted core; (2) a transient increase in BDNF immunoreactivity in the internal region of the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (penumbra area) at 12 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; (3) increased truncated TrkB immunoreactivity in astrocytes surrounding the area of the infarction; and (4) increased full-length TrkB immunoreactivity in scattered neurons, distant from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, in ipsilateral and contralateral cortices at 24 and 48 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We next studied the regulation of TrkB expression by BDNF, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and its neuroprotective effects in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In control non-ischemic rats, grafting of mock- or BDNF-transfected fibroblasts (F3A-MT or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30231">F3N</z:chebi>-BDNF cell lines, respectively) in the medial part of the somatosensory cortex increased truncated TrkB immunoreactivity in neighboring astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grafting alone also increased full-length TrkB in the vicinity of the mock graft (at 24 and 48 h) and the BDNF-grafted graft (at 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ischemic animals grafted with the mock-transfected cell line did not show any further regulation of TrkB receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, ischemic animals grafted with the BDNF cell line showed an up-regulation of full-length TrkB expression in neurons located in the internal border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of nuclear DNA fragmentation in situ, combined with microtubule-associated protein 2 immunohistochemistry, revealed that most cells dying in the borders of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (penumbra area) at 48 h following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were found between <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded, mock-transfected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded, and BDNF-transfected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was similar in nongrafted and mock-grafted rats subjected to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the number of cells with nuclear DNA breaks was significantly reduced in the penumbra area close to the BDNF graft in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results show that BDNF specifically up-regulates its full-length TrkB receptor in cortical neurons of the penumbra area and prevents their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in an in vivo model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
