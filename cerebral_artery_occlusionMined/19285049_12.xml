<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oxymatrine is proven to protect ischemic and reperfusion injury in liver, intestine and heart, this effect is via anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this protective effect applies to ischemic injury in brain, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of oxymatrine and the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), high dose (pMCAO+oxymatrine 120 mg/kg), low dose (pMCAO+oxymatrine 60 mg/kg) and sham operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model and administered oxymatrine intraperitoneally immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and once daily on the following days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after MCAO, neurological deficit was evaluated using a modified six point scale; brain water content was measured; NF-kappaB expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was analyzed with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with pMCAO group, neurological deficit in high dose group was improved (P&lt;0.05), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was decreased (P&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was alleviated (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these indices, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis indicated that NF-kappaB expression was significantly decreased in high dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low dose of oxymatrine did not affect NF-kappaB expression in pMCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oxymatrine reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume induced by pMCAO, this effect may be through the decreasing of NF-kappaB expression </plain></SENT>
