<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction is a common facet of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the alteration of drug transporter, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp), has been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study explores influence of damaged <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and elevated P-gp on cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> penetration after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) of rats, and Na(2)S(2)O(4) induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reoxygenation (H/R) damage of rat brain mirovessel endothelial cells (RBMECs) respectively, served as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown model in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evans-Blue (EB) extravagation and (125)I-albumin were used to quantify <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction; UPLC-MS/MS analytical method was performed to determine accurately the concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> in brain tissue and cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were applied to evaluate transport function and protein expression of P-gp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpressed ICAM-1 and MMP-9 mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which induced EB leakage and (125)I-albumin uptake increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> in brain tissue, but intracellular concentration reduced evidently after H/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcellular transportation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> elevated when P-gp function or expression was inhibited after H/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicated that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> penetration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> condition was not only depending on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown, but also regulated by P-gp </plain></SENT>
