<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that the SHRSP Y chromosome contains a locus that contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in SHRSP/WKY F2 hybrids and that SHRSP exhibit an increased vulnerability to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increased vulnerability is inherited as a codominant trait, and a putative role for the Y chromosome has been suggested in F1 hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate further the role of Y chromosome in blood pressure (BP) regulation and in the vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have constructed consomic strains by selectively replacing the Y chromosome from WKY rats with that of SHRSP, and vice versa, by using a marker-assisted breeding strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO was carried out by electrocoagulation, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume expressed as a percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry during a baseline period of 5 weeks followed by a 3-week period of salt loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that the transfer of the Y chromosome from WKY onto SHRSP background significantly reduced systolic BP in consomic strains, SP.WKYGlaY(w) (n=6) versus SHRSP (n=6) (209.2+/-10.4 mm Hg versus 241.7+/-7.7 mm Hg, F=5.88, P=0.038) during the salt-loading period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the reciprocal consomic strain, WKY.SPGlaY(s) (n=5), systolic BP was increased compared with WKY parental strain (n=6) (147.6+/-2.4 mm Hg versus 132.6+/-5.1 mm Hg, F=6.11, P=0.035) during baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes in consomic strains were not significantly different from their respective parental strain: WKY.SPGlaY(s) (n=7) versus WKY (n=7), 22.8+/-3.7% versus 22.2+/-8.0%, 95% CI=-12.7, 4.2, P=0.3; SP.WKYGlaY(w) (n=7) versus SHRSP (n=6), 37.7+/-4.4% versus 33.6+/-7.6%, 95% CI=-20.3, 12.1, P=0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the SHRSP Y chromosome harbors a locus contributing to systolic BP, whereas no contribution to vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can be detected </plain></SENT>
