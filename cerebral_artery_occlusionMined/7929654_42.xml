<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have provided important data on early circulatory and biochemical changes, but typically their correspondence with metabolic and hemodynamic findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients has been poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To fill the gap between experimental studies at early time points and rather late clinical studies, we repeatedly measured CBF, CMRO2, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and CMRglc in six cats before and up to 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (MCAO), using the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady state and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]fluorodeoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> methods and a high-resolution <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Likewise, three sham-operated control cats were studied during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined on serial histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the areas of final <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> that were slightly larger than the histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, mean CBF dropped to approximately 40% of control values immediately on <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If further decreased to &lt; 20% during the course of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was most conspicuous in border zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMRO2 fell to a lesser degree (55%), eventually reaching approximately 25% of its control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At early stages, OEF increased mainly in the center of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With time, areas of increased OEF moved from the center to the periphery of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, progressive secondary decreases in OEF in conjunction with further reductions of CBF and CMRO2 indicated the development of central <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings are highly suggestive of a dynamic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In five cats with complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, CBF decreased and OEF increased in the contralateral hemisphere after 24 h, suggesting whole-brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This effect may be explained by the widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> found histologically in addition to the nonspecific CBF reductions and OEF elevations observed also in the sham-operated controls after 1 day in the experimental condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In one cat, cortical OEF increased only transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CMRO2 and CMRglc were eventually restored, and the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> regional pathophysiologic changes can be repeatedly assessed by multivariate PET in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Viable tissue can be detected up to several hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and the transition of misery-perfused regions into <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or preserved tissue can be followed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The present results support the concept of a dynamic penumbra, in which for up to 24 h tissue damage spreads progressively from the center to the periphery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sequential high-resolution PET provides insight into the dynamics of regional pathophysiology and may thus further the development of rational therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
