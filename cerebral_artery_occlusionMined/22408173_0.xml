<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels are predictive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and more fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in humans, whereas <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements are associated with decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because VDD occurs with other comorbid conditions that are also independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, this study examined the specific effect of VDD on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were fed control or VDD diet for 8 wk and were subject to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VDD diet reduced circulating <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels to one fifth (22%) of that observed in rats fed control chow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in animals fed VDD diet were significantly larger, and sensorimotor behavioral testing indicated that VDD animals had more severe poststroke behavioral impairment than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VDD animals were also found to have significantly lower levels of the neuroprotective hormone IGF-I in plasma and the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine analysis indicated that VDD significantly reduced IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-10 expression in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced IL-6 up-regulation was significantly higher in VDD animals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that VDD exacerbates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, involving both a dysregulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> as well as suppression of known neuroprotectants such as IGF-I </plain></SENT>
