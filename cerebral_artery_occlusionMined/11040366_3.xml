<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Freeze-dried brain sections prepared from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were scanned with a collimated X-ray beam (0.18 mm in diameter, 50-kV acceleration voltage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent Kalpha X-rays of P, S, Cl, and K were detectable, so that the two-dimensional distribution of fluorescent X-ray intensities could be determined for these elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, quantitative determination was possible for P and K by using the fundamental parameter technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the accurate determination of Na and Ca was difficult, because of the low energy of Kalpha X-ray of Na, and the interference of K-Kbeta with Ca-Kalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change in elemental concentrations in ischemic tissue, including the decrease in K concentration and increase in Cl concentration, was demonstrated by this method as a two-dimensional contour map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since it is possible to obtain a pictorial representation of the elemental concentration in tissue sections, this method may be useful to evaluate the ionic changes in injured brain tissue in relation to histological or autoradiographical observations </plain></SENT>
