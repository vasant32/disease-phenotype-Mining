<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rodents, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment protects the cortex from cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha (ERalpha) dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ERalpha is only transiently expressed in the cortex during neonatal development and is very low in uninjured adult cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, ERalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is upregulated in the cortex of female rats, but the mechanism of this increase is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also unknown whether a similar increase in ERalpha expression in seen in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the following studies, male and vehicle or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-treated ovariectomized (OVX) female rats underwent MCAO to investigate the regulation of ERalpha expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after surgery, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or genomic DNA was collected from 1 mm micropunches taken from 300 mum brain sections for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or methylation-specific (MSP) PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, adjacent 20 mum sections were processed for ERalpha immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In OVX females, ERalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were increased in the ischemic cortex, but unchanged in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this increase in ERalpha in females is due to a reversal of gene silencing by DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using MSP targeting of CpG islands within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the rat ERalpha gene, we found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> decreased methylation in the ischemic cortex of both groups of females, but there was no change in methylation in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that MeCP2 associates with ERalpha 5'UTR corresponding with the methylation status of the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data are the first to demonstrate a difference in the regulation of ERalpha expression in response to MCAO between males and females and that methylation of the ERalpha gene corresponds with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the brain </plain></SENT>
