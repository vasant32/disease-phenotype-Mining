<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the brain has shown to be able to achieve spontaneous functional recovery despite severe cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> was induced by 60 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was followed using two magnetic resonance imaging modalities: diffusion spectrum imaging (acquired before, one and four weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (acquired before and five weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To confirm the imaging observations, immunohistochemical staining for myelin, astrocytes and macrophages/microglia was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At four weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a focal alteration of the diffusion anisotropy was observed between the ipsilesional ventricle and the lesion area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using tractography this perturbation was identified as reorganization of the ipsilesional internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional imaging at five weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> demonstrated activation of the primary sensorimotor cortex in both hemispheres in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats except one animal lacking a functional response in the ipsilesional cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fiber tracking showed a transhemispheric fiber connection through the corpus callosum, which-in the rat without functional recovery-was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study shows the influence of the internal capsule reorganization, combined with inter-hemispheric connections though the corpus callosum, on the functional activation of the brain from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, tractography opens a new door to non-invasively investigate the structural correlates of lack of functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
