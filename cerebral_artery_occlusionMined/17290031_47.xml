<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies with intraarterial thrombolysis suggest more proximal occlusions carry greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> burden and benefit less from local therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using validated transcranial Doppler criteria for specific <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> flow grades), we compared the rate of dramatic recovery (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt; or =2 at 24 hours) and favorable outcomes at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale &lt; or =1) for each occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the likelihood of recanalization at various occlusion sites and its predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, stepwise logistic regression was used to determine predictors of complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-five patients had a mean age 69+/-13 years and 48.5% were women (median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 16 [range, 3 to 32], mean time to transcranial Doppler 140+/-84 minutes, and mean time to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 145+/-68 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had an OR of 2 for complete recanalization (50 of 113 [44.2%], 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.1, P=0.005), proximal middle cerebral artery 0.7 (49 of 163 [30%], 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.1, P=0.13), terminal internal carotid artery 0.1 (one of 17 [5.9%], 95% CI: 0.015 to 0.8, P=0.015), tandem cervical internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery 0.7 (6 of 22 [27%], 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.9, P=0.5), and basilar artery 0.96 (3 of 10 [30%], 95% CI: 0.2 to 4, P=0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prerecombinant tissue plasminogen activator National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> flow grade at the occlusion site were the negative independent predictors for complete recanalization in the final model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no associations among time to treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms, or recanalization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with no flow (Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> 0) at the occlusion site had less probability of complete recanalization than patients with dampened flow (Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> 3) (OR(adj): 0.256, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.595, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring (exposure to ultrasound) was a positive predictor for complete recanalization (OR(adj): 3.02, 95% CI: 1.396 to 6.514, P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt; or =2 at 24 hours was achieved in 66 of 305 patients (22%): distal middle cerebral artery 33% (35 of 107), tandem cervical internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery 24% (5 of 21), proximal middle cerebral artery 16% (24 of 155), basilar artery 25% (2 of 8), and none of the patients with terminal internal carotid artery had dramatic recovery (0%, n=14; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale score &lt; or =1 was achieved in 90 of 260 patients (35%): distal middle cerebral artery 52% (50 of 96), proximal middle cerebral artery 25% (33 of 131), tandem cervical internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery 21% (3 of 14), terminal internal carotid artery 18% (2 of 11), and basilar artery 25% (2 of 8) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were twice as likely to have a good long-term outcome as patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1 to 4, P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical response to thrombolysis is influenced by the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with no detectable residual flow signals as well as those with terminal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> are least likely to respond early or long term </plain></SENT>
