<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether orally administered OEA is effective against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 90 min followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its preventive effects, OEA (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg, ig) was administered for 3 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its therapeutic effects, OEA (40 mg/kg, ig) was administered at 0.5 or 1h before reperfusion or at 0 or 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some experiments, the PPARα <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK886 (10mg/kg, ig) was administered 0.5h before OEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> degree were determined at 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption was evaluated by Evans blue (EB) leakage at 6h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR and western blot were performed to detect PPARα <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oral OEA pretreatment improved neurological dysfunction reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and alleviated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner; the most effective dose was 40 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic time is within 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OEA also increased PPARα <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PPARα <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK886 abolished the protective effects of OEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that orally administered OEA protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic injury in mice, at least in part by activating PPARα </plain></SENT>
