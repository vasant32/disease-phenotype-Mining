<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristic deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals was an initial, fairly dense faciobrachial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> with, in a few instances, some accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> for a few days, rapidly improving over the first few months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some animals retained very evident arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>; most animals retained <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the face; the majority showed recovery of reaching and placing reactions and some movement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> joints of the upper limb, although fine movements of the fingers remained invariably impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homonymous hemianopia, at least to attention, also appeared to be characteristic, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the animals recovered a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gait and leaping was regained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The close correlation between this and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> appears to confirm that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the baboon is a reliable, repeatable and acceptable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
