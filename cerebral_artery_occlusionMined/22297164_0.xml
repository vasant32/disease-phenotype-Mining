<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although EGb 761 is purported to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of benefits, here, we were interested to study the neuroprotective properties of EGb 761 and its components and determine whether nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2)/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO1) induction of the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) pathway contributes to neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were pretreated with EGb 761 or one of its constituents (bilobalide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35186">terpene</z:chebi> free material [TFM]) for 7days and then subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) and 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> components except TFM significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and neuritogenic properties of EGb 761 in primary neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle-treated cells, pretreatment with EGb 761 significantly enhanced the survival of neurons exposed to tertiary butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilobalide and ginkgolide A also protected cells against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that EGb 761 pretreatment significantly increased the protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO1, GAPDH, β-actin, CRMP2, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 during t-BuOOH-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that EGb 761 not only has <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity but also neuritogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Demonstrating such effects for possible drug discovery may prove beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
