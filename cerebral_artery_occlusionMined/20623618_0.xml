<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, particular phenolic ingredients, such as 2-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25399">methylphenol</z:chebi> (2M4MP), of the antidiarrheic drug wood creosote significantly prevented cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by both <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in cultured rat hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we further evaluated the pharmacological properties of 2M4MP on Ca(2+) influx across native and acquired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor (NMDAR) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of 2M4MP significantly prevented the loss of cellular viability and the increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) levels as determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5107">Fluo-3</z:chebi> in cultured rat hippocampal neurons briefly exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brief exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> also led to a marked increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> free Ca(2+) levels determined by Rhod-2, in addition to intracellular free Ca(2+) levels, in HEK293 cells expressing either NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B subunit channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The further addition of the general NMDAR channel blocker dizocilpine similarly inhibited the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) levels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> in both types of acquired NMDAR channels, whereas the NR2B subunit selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ifenprodil drastically inhibited the increase by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> in HEK293 cells expressing NR1/NR2B, but not NR1/NR2A, subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 2M4MP significantly and selectively inhibited the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced influx of Ca(2+) across acquired NR1/NR2B channels in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, prior daily oral administration of 2M4MP significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 1 day after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that 2M4MP may protect neurons from excitotoxicity through preferential inhibition of Ca(2+) influx across NMDAR channels composed of NR1/NR2B subunits </plain></SENT>
