<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether sensorimotor deficits measured soon after reperfusion could predict the occurrence and magnitude of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to left MCAO for 2 h according to the intraluminal thread method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 0, 1, 2, and 3 h after reperfusion, the animals were examined for neurological deficits using an expanded scale comprising the following tests: (A) postural reflex, (B) <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp> motion, (C) falling to contralateral side, (D) placement of the contralateral forelimb during motion, and (E) general state of alertness or consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deficits were graded from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 2 or 3 (severe), and the final neuro-score was a summation of these scores over the various time points and among the various tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuro-score of the animals that survived up to 24 h after MCAO ranged from 0 to 8.2 and positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (p=0.0002-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at least three animals with moderate neuro-scores (4.5-6.0) did not exhibit any sign of infarcted brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other animals having a distinct neuro-score (3.2 and 8.2, respectively) exhibited cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with the same size (235 mmÂ³) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the extent of neurological deficit assessed within the first 3h after reperfusion does not reliably correspond to the occurrence and magnitude of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the neuro-score, when measured acutely within the first few hours after reperfusion, does not serve as a reliable criterion for preselecting animals with similar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
