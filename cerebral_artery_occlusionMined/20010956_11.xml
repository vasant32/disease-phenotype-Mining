<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these effects of E(2) are known to require <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-alpha (ER alpha), the cellular target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cell type-specific ER mutant mice in an in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we specifically investigated the role of ER alpha in neuronal cells versus its role in the microglia in the mediation of neuroprotection by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated and analyzed two different tissue-specific knockout mouse lines lacking ER alpha either in cells of myeloid lineage, including microglia, or in the neurons of the forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both E(2)-treated and E(2)-untreated mutant and control mice were subjected to a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 48 h, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of E(2)-treated female myeloid-specific ER alpha knockout mice was similar to that of E(2)-treated control mice, both male and female neuron-specific ER alpha mutant mice had larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than did control mice after E(2) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neuronal ER alpha in female and male mice mediates neuroprotective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> effects in an in vivo mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas microglial ER alpha is dispensable </plain></SENT>
