<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the GSH level significantly decreased in the ischemic core, but increased significantly in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed a differential change of the GSH levels in neurons and astrocytes in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GSH level in neurons increased significantly whereas it decreased slightly in astrocytes in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
