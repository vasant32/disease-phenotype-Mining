<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reperfusion injury is one of the factors that unfavorably affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome and shortens the window of opportunity for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surges of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation on reperfusion have been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant generation of these radicals can lead to formation of the strong oxidant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have examined the role of NO generation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation on reperfusion injury in a mouse model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 hours) and reperfusion (22 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining; blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine formation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly decreased (47%) in animals treated with the nonselective nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(omega)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (L-NA) at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specific inhibitor of neuronal NOS, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), given at reperfusion, showed no protection, although preischemic treatment with 7-NI decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, prereperfusion administration of both NOS inhibitors decreased tyrosine nitration (a marker of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> toxicity) in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>L-NA treatment also significantly reduced vascular damage, as indicated by decreased Evans blue extravasation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that in addition to the detrimental action of NO formed by neuronal NOS during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, NO generation at reperfusion plays a significant role in reperfusion injury, possibly through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contrary to L-NA, failure of 7-NI to protect against reperfusion injury suggests that the source of NO is the cerebrovascular compartment </plain></SENT>
