<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with intraluminal technique, lesion volume and its reproducibility vary among laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is useful to optimize the reliability, conventional methods require a craniotomy and special apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel approach for LDF monitoring of rCBF through lateral aspect of the skull without a craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SD rats were subjected to 45 min of MCAO using an intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO was achieved by an examiner who had been trained 4 weeks for making the model with no LDF monitoring (Group-1, n = 12), while in the other group, the same examiner induced MCAO using a novel approach of LDF monitoring (Group-2, n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rCBF was detected through an LDF probe attached to the lateral aspect of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were estimated for comparison between the two groups 2 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality rate was 25% in Group-1 and 0% in Group-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume of the cortex in Group-2 was 167.21 +/- 48.54 mm(3) (mean +/- SD), which was larger than that in Group-1 (112.77 +/- 36.03 mm(3), P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The coefficient variation of the lesion volume was smaller in Group-2 (29%) than in Group-1 (35%), indicating better reproducibility of the lesion volume in Group-2 than in Group-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The approach of LDF monitoring through the lateral aspect of skull was useful for making large consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with reducing intraanimal variability and unexpected animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
