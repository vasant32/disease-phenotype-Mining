<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic boundary area after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single dose of VIP was given via i.c.v. injection at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed to assay <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and brain levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of VEGF and its receptors (flt-1 and flk-1), as well as endothelial proliferation, was measured using rat brain microvascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses revealed significant (P&lt;0.05) increases in the numbers of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive endothelial cells and microvessels at the boundary of the ischemic lesion in rats treated with VIP compared with rats treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blotting analysis showed that treatment with VIP significantly (P&lt;0.05) raised VEGF levels in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with VIP increased flt-1 and flk-1 immunoreactivity in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, incubation with VIP significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased the proliferation of endothelial cells and induced the expression of VEGF, flt-1 and flk-1 in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect of VIP on the proliferation of endothelial cells was significantly (P&lt;0.01) inhibited by SU5416, a selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that treatment with VIP enhances <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic brain, and this effect may be mediated by increases in levels of VEGF and its receptors </plain></SENT>
