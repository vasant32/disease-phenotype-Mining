<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether damage to the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) occurs in remote areas after a focal cortical lesion remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated tight junction-related proteins and tight junction microstructure in the ipsilateral thalamus during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> lesion (CAL) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six hypertensive and normotensive rats were subjected to MCAO or CAL; another 18 rats in each group were submitted to sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zonula Occluden (ZO)-1, occludin and albumin were detected by western blotting 12 and 24 h after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tight junction microstructure was evaluated using electron microscopy, whereas albumin location in the ipsilateral thalamus was determined using double immunostaining for albumin and occludin or albumin and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) 24 h after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAO or CAL, occludin expression was reduced to 78.4% and 81.3%, respectively, compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A reduction in ZO-1 expression in the ipsilateral thalamus (to 79%) was seen only after CAL (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Membrane contact at the tight junction was discontinuous in the ipsilateral thalamus in both MCAO and CAL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Albumin levels were 23.2% and 82.5% higher in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO and CAL, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the albumin-positive area that coincided with the occludin-positive area in the MCAO and CAL groups was 76.8% and 64.6%, respectively, indicating that albumin was mainly localized around the microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that tight junction integrity decreases during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO and CAL in rats </plain></SENT>
