<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear translocation of EndoG has been observed in the ischemic area following transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in mice, but not after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the cellular and temporal expression of EndoG in infarcted cortex during the first 24 h after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice, using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rt-PCR and cell specific immunoflourescence markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EndoG translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as early as 4 h and with a significant increase in the number of EndoG positive nuclei at 12 and 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear translocation of EndoG was observed in degenerating NeuN positive neurons that were evenly distributed throughout the developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Translocation of EndoG was supported by unaltered EndoG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EndoG was neither expressed in GFAP positive astrocytes nor in CD11b positive microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD11b positive microglia, but not infiltrating CD11b positive bone marrow-derived macrophages, were shown to express activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The translocation of EndoG to the nucleus of neurons in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> implicates EndoG in ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased knowledge about EndoG involvement in ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in mice might offer a promise to control processes involved in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
