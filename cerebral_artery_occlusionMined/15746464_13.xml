<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adrenomedullin (AM) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and inhibits cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to improve neurological deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether AM enhances the therapeutic potency of MSC transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats (n=100) were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion, rats were assigned randomly to receive intravenous transplantation of MSCs plus subcutaneous infusion of AM for 7 days (MSC+AM group), AM infusion alone (AM group), MSC transplantation alone (MSC group), or vehicle infusion (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological and immunohistological assessments were performed to examine the effects of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some engrafted MSCs were positive for neuronal and endothelial cell markers, although the number of differentiated MSCs did not differ significantly between the MSC and MSC+AM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological score significantly improved in the MSC, AM, and MSC+AM groups compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, improvement in the MSC+AM group was significantly greater than that in the MSC and AM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was marked induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic penumbra in the MSC+AM group, followed by the AM, MSC, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AM infusion significantly inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of transplanted MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, the number of engrafted MSCs in the MSC+AM group was significantly higher than that in the MSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AM enhanced the therapeutic potency of MSCs, including neurological improvement, possibly through inhibition of MSC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
