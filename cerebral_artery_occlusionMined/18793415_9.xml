<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> results in enhanced expression of cerebrovascular contractile receptors in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) leading to the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we explored the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in receptor expression following ischemic brain injury using the specific MEK1 inhibitor U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULT: Rats were subjected to a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for 48-h and the ischemic area was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Elk-1, and of endothelin <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB, angiotensin AT1, and 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT1B receptors were analyzed with immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy in cerebral arteries, microvessels and in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of endothelin ETB receptor was analyzed by quantitative Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that there is an increase in the number of contractile smooth muscle receptors in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and in micro- vessels within the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enhanced expression occurs in the smooth muscle cells as verified by co-localization studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This receptor upregulation is furthermore associated with enhanced expression of pERK1/2 and of transcription factor pElk-1 in the vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blockade of transcription with the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, given at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion or as late as 6 hours after the insult, reduced transcription (pERK1/2 and pElk-1), the enhanced vascular receptor expression, and attenuated the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and improved neurology score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that MCAO results in upregulation of cerebrovascular ETB, AT1 and 5-HT1B receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blockade of this event with a MEK1 inhibitor as late as 6 h after the insult reduced the enhanced vascular receptor expression and the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
