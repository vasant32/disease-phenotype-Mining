<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, we are missing appropriate methodology to study micro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> laser-scanning microscopy (2P-LSM) and transgenic mouse models expressing cell type specific reporters have been used to examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related insults, e.g. perturbations of neuronal process <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and local blood flow in the MCAO - middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glia and pericytes can be visualized by selective fluorescent protein expression, e.g. astrocytes by their cyan-fluorescent ECFP, pericytes by red-fluorescent tdtomato and microglia by green fluorescent EGFP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these mice, the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and the immediate as well as long-term cellular responses can be monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new prototype of microCT incorporating a fast X-ray XPAD3 camera has been recently set up to allow cerebral angiography at high sampling rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data indicate that it is useful to monitor blood perfusion disturbance (i.e. lateralization) in the brain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice following retro-orbital injection of iodinated contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We expect this technology to be adequate to assess in real time the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models on brain blood perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By localizing perfusion anomalies, we will evaluate the extent of non-perfused areas and correlate these observations with subsequent behavioral deficits, and with local changes in myelin content in white matter tracks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spectral properties of the XPAD3 detector moreover allow for the simultaneous identification and localization of several contrast agents opening the way to whole body multicolor imaging of vessels and inflammatory cells in the context of microstrokes </plain></SENT>
