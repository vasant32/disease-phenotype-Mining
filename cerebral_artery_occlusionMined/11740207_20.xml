<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on neuronal and astrocytic intermediary metabolism were studied in rats 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after MCAO using in vivo injection of [1-13C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [1,2- 13C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> combined with ex vivo <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the ischemic core (lateral caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex) and penumbra (upper frontoparietal cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, both neuronal and astrocytic metabolism were impaired from 30 minutes MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a continuous loss of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> from glutamatergic neurons that was not replaced as neuronal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and use of astrocytic precursors gradually declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In GABAergic neurons astrocytic precursors were not used in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> synthesis at any time after MCAO, and neuronal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-shunt activity declined with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No flux through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle was found in GABAergic neurons at 240 minutes MCAO, indicating neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra, the neurotransmitter pool of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> coming from astrocytic glutamine was preserved while neuronal metabolism progressively declined, implying that glutamine contributed significantly to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In GABAergic neurons, astrocytic precursors were used to a limited extent during the initial 120 minutes, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle activity was continued for 240 minutes </plain></SENT>
