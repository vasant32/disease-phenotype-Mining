<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In the intraluminal suture model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the mouse, disturbance of blood flow from the internal carotid artery to the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) may affect the size of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> involvement in the model was investigated and modified for consistent MCAO without involving the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven C57Bl/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the length of coating over the tip of the suture (1, 2, 3, or 4 mm) and subjected to transient MCAO for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time topographical cerebral blood flow was monitored over both hemispheres by laser speckle flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of reperfusion, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> territories and volumes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 1- and 2-mm coating groups showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 3- and 4-mm coating groups, 62.5% and 75% of mice, respectively, showed lesions in both the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territories and other lesions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice in the 1- and 2-mm coating groups had significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than the 3- and 4-mm groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laser speckle flowmetry was useful to distinguish whether the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory would undergo infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small changes in the coating length of the intraluminal suture may be critical, and 1-2 mm of coating appeared to be optimal to produce consistent MCAO without involving the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laser speckle flowmetry could predict the territory of infarction and improve the consistency of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
