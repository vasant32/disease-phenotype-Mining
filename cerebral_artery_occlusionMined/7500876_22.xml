<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the relationship between reductions in the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and autoradiographic CBF analysis to examine rats subjected to 30 or 90 min of permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 30-min occlusion group (n = 10), the area with substantially reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (15% or more below the contralateral level [ADC15]) corresponded best to the area with CBF below 25 ml/100 g/min and was significantly smaller than the area with CBF below 50 ml/100 g/min (CBF50), a level associated with reduced protein synthesis and delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (40 +/- 13% versus 74 +/- 8% of the ischemic hemisphere; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 90-min occlusion group (n = 6), the ADC15 area corresponded best to the CBF30 to CBF35 area and was again significantly smaller than the CBF50 area (54 +/- 13% versus 73 +/- 20%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the area of substantially reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> at 30 and 90 min represents only 53% and 74%, respectively, of the tissue at risk for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a potential limitation in using early D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
