<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we described the identification of SLPI expression in ischemic cortex by suppression subtractive hybridization strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our full-length rat SLPI cDNA shares 81% and 63% amino acid sequence identity with its mouse and human homologs, respectively, and with several polymorphisms to previous reported rat sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis confirmed that SLPI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly induced in the ischemic brain tissue at 12 h (5.1-fold increase over sham controls, n = 4, p &lt; 0.05), peaked at 2 days (26.1-fold increase, p &lt; 0.001), and sustained up to 5 days (5.1-fold increase, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLPI was localized in neurons and astrocytes in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone from 24 to 72 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by means of immunohistochemical and confocal microscopy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of a recombinant adenovirus overexpressing SLPI (Adv/SLPI) into the cortical tissue resulted in up to 58.4% reduction in ischemic lesion over controls at the site of Adv/SLPI expression (p &lt; 0.01, n = 8) and significantly improved functional outcome (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced expression of SLPI might play a neuroprotective role in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, possibly because of rapid inhibition of activated proteases and its suppression in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
