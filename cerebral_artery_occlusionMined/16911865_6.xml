<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to test the hypothesis that occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) results in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, we investigated whether lesion volume, hippocampal pathology, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, or severity of behavioral impairment is associated with the development and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> or interictal spiking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was induced by intracerebral injection of endothelin-1 (ET; 120 pmol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of ET-injected rats were followed-up for 6 months (n = 15) and another for 12 months (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals were injected with saline (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of early and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was monitored by intermittent video-electroencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor function was tested with the running wheel and tapered beam-walking tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emotional learning and memory were assessed with the fear conditioning test and spatial learning and memory with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, brains were processed for histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one rat developed late spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epileptiform interictal spiking was detected in 9 of 26 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> did not predict the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, spiking activity, or severity of behavioral impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by intracerebral injection of ET was not a strong trigger of epileptogenesis in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of age, genetic background, and location of ET-injection on the development of hyperexcitability and the risk of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
