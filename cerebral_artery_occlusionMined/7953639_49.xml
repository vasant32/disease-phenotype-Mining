<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present experiments were designed to study under what circumstances middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by an intraluminal filament technique leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and what the mechanisms are </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion by this technique lead to a rise in body (core) temperature to 39.0-39.5 degrees C during the first 2-4 h, and to sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> thereafter (38.5-39.0 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> could only be avoided if anesthesia (with control of temperature) was maintained for 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 1 h of recirculation or, in unanesthetized animals, if external cooling was maintained for 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 2 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control of temperature only during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not prevent a postischemic rise in temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion had less effect on body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results are presented which suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> observed is due to an interference, by the intraluminal filament, of circulation to hypothalamic centers regulating body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> induced may blunt or obliterate the effect of drugs, normally considered to ameliorate brain damage due to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
