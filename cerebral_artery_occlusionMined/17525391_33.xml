<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) treatment on retired breeder rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female retired breeder rats were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by an injection of 2 x 10(6) male BMSCs (n=8) or phosphate-buffered saline (n=11) into the ipsilateral internal carotid artery at 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were humanely killed 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional tests, in situ hybridization, and histochemical and immunohistochemical staining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant recovery of neurological deficits was found in BMSC-treated rats beginning 2 weeks after cell injection compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of cell transplantation persisted for at least 1 year (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for the Y chromosome showed that donor cells survived in the brains of recipient rats, among which 22.3+/-1.95% of cells expressed the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, 16.8+/-2.13% expressed the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2, and 5.5+/-0.42% and &lt;1% of cells colocalized with the microglial marker IB4 and the endothelial cell marker <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only very few BMSCs, however, were found in peripheral organs such as the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney in recipient rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMSCs significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01), the thickness of the lesion scar wall (P&lt;0.01), and the number of Nogo-A-positive cells (P&lt;0.05) along the scar border; meanwhile, synaptophysin expression (P&lt;0.05) was significantly increased in BMSC-treated ischemic brains compared with control untreated brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of BMSCs on ischemic brain tissue persisted for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most surviving BMSCs were present in the ischemic brain, but very few were found in other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The long-term improvement in functional outcome may be related to the structural and molecular changes induced by BMSCs </plain></SENT>
