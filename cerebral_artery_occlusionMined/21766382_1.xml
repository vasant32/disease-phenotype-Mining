<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the ischemic damage to brain tissue evolves over time and with an uneven spatial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early irreversible changes occur in the ischemic core, whereas, in the penumbra, which receives more collateral blood flow, the damage is more mild and delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A better characterization of the penumbra, irreversibly damaged and healthy tissues is needed to understand the mechanisms involved in tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRSI is a powerful tool for this task if the scan time can be decreased whilst maintaining high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we made improvements to a (1)H MRSI protocol to study middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spatial distribution of changes in the neurochemical profile was investigated, with an effective spatial resolution of 1.4 μL, applying the protocol on a 14.1-T magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The acquired maps included the difficult-to-separate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glutamine resonances and, to our knowledge, the first mapping of metabolites γ-aminobutyric acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in vivo, within a metabolite measurement time of 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maps were in excellent agreement with findings from single-voxel spectroscopy and offer spatial information at a scan time acceptable for most animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The metabolites measured differed with respect to the temporal evolution of their concentrations and the localization of these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and N-acetylaspartate concentration changes largely overlapped with the T(2)-hyperintense region visualized with MRI, whereas changes in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">cholines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> affected the entire middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glutamine maps showed elevated levels in the ischemic striatum until 8 h after reperfusion, and until 24 h in cortical tissue, indicating differences in excitotoxic effects and secondary energy failure in these tissue types </plain></SENT>
