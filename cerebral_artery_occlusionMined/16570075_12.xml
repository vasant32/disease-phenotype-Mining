<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have implicated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> as a vasoconstrictive mediator in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> inhibitor, HET0016, on lesion volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF) after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue concentrations of HET0016 were determined after a 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate rats were treated with HET0016 or vehicle before 90 mins of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and cerebral flow was determined using laser Doppler flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of MCAO on in vitro microsomal formation of mono-oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results show that HET0016 has a short biologic half-life, distributes into the brain, and is associated with a 79.6% reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> concentration in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was greatly reduced in HET0016-treated (9.1%+/-4.9%) versus vehicle-treated (57.4%+/-9.8%; n=6; P&lt;0.001) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An attenuation of the observed decrease in CBF was observed in HET0016-treated (180 mins 89.2%+/-6.2%; 240 mins 88.1%+/-5.7% of baseline flow) versus vehicle control (180 mins 57.6%+/-19.0%; 240 mins 53.8%+/-20.0% of baseline flow; n=6; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain cortical microsomal formation rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> was also reduced at 24 h in the ipsilateral hemisphere after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data support a significant role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
