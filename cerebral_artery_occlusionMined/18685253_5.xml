<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is produced by three NO synthases (NOS), iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Production of NO by iNOS plays key roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, while eNOS is a protective enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> and the levels of NOS isoforms induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain samples were collected at 24 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results confirmed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the expression levels of iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of iNOS and nNOS increased in vehicle-treated animals, while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevented injury-induced increase of iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to iNOS levels, eNOS levels decreased in vehicle-treated animals, while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decrease of eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides further evidence that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> exerts neuroprotective effects, and the regulation of NOS isoforms by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> may contribute to the neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
