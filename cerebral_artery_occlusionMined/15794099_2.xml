<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PACAP), are members of a VIP/secretin/glucagon family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were demonstrated to possess the neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are not suited to be developed as a medicine for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> because of their susceptibilities to endopeptidases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effects of IK 312548 (IK), VIP derivative, and Ac-PACAP, PACAP derivative, on the 10 min two-vessel occlusion (2 VO) model in C 57 BL/6 N mice lacking a part of the posterior communicating artery, and the 30 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in ICR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 10 ml x kg(-1) dose of each derivative (final concentration; 1 fmol x kg(-1) and 100 pmol x kg(-1)) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to each animal just after the preparation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2 VO experiments, the number of neuronal cells in hippocampus was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However IK and Ac-PACAP treatments inhibited such reductions of neuronal cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particularly, between 1 pmol x kg(-1) and 100 pmol x kg(-) IK, and also between 10 fmol x kg(-1) and 1 pmol x kg(-1) Ac-PACAP significantly protected neuronal cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In MCAO experiments, more than 60% of hemisphere was damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By treatment of IK (1-100 pmol x kg(-1)) and Ac-PACAP (1 fmol-1 pmol x kg(-1)), the range of brain damage decreased in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ac-PACAP and IK after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> could pass the blood-brain barrier and protect brain cell damage </plain></SENT>
