<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the hypothesis that N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-aspartyl-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (NAAG) is a modulatory neurotransmitter or storage form of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, we have pursued a novel strategy of therapeutic intervention, blockade of N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase), the enzyme that hydrolyzes NAAG to liberate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, the decrease in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was accompanied by an equimolar, reciprocal rise in extracellular NAAG </plain></SENT>
