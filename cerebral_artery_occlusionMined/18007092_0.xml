<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rats were built by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and then the rats were randomly divided into a Naoxintong group (that was traditional Chinese medicine group,TCM group), a Western medicine group, a model group, a sham operation group, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After corresponding treatment, the ratso behaviors were detected by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> experiment to obtain their performance record of learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were detected by Nissl stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CGRP in the hippocampus was measured with immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The masculine cells about CGRP of the TCM group were more than those of the model one (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Naoxintong capsules improved the ability of learning and memory in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rats, prevented the pyramidal cells on CA1 field in hippocampus from deceasing, increased the number of masculine cells about CGRP, and deceased the gray scale value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Naoxintong capsules can raise the number of masculine nerve cells of CGRP, protect the pyramidal cells of VD rats, and lessen their learing and dysmnesy, which may be part of the mechanism of improving learning and memory capacity of VD model in rats </plain></SENT>
