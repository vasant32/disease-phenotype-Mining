<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a novel method to selectively cool the rat brain and investigate its neuroprotective effects following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The novelty of our method of selective brain cooling (SBC) was that the extraluminal cooling of the carotid arterial blood was achieved by using a cooling cuff wrapped around each common carotid artery (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 20 min of CCA cooling, brain temperature could be lowered by 2-5 degrees C below the baseline and maintained stable for approximately 2 h while maintaining body temperature at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects of SBC were observed on systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, or tissue histology in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats having sustained 2-h MCAo, intra-ischemic SBC for 90 min, initiated 30 min following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, significantly reduced infarction measured at 24 h post-injury (normothermic rats=312+/-51 mm3, SBC rats=139+/-83 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subgroup experiments, the incidence of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarization (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>) was assessed during the MCAo and cooling period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to normothermic but ischemic rats, SBC significantly reduced the number of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> events from 6.2+/-2.5 to 2.0+/-2.5, and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes from 323+/-79 to 139+/-102 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this extralumimal cooling method of SBC provides a safe and efficient approach to rapidly and safely achieve hypothermic neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
