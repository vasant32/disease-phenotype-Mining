<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: A, sham-operated group; B, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion group; C, K(ATP) opener treatment group; and D, K(ATP) opener and blocker treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established by using the intraluminal suture occlusion method, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by TUNEL staining, and expressions of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The numbers of apoptotic neurons at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h were significantly less in group C than in groups B and D (P&lt; 0.01 or P&lt; 0.05); and there was no difference between groups B and D at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) The expressions of caspase-3 mRNA and caspase-8 mRNA at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times and the expressions of caspase-9 mRNA at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h were significantly lower in group C than in groups B and D (P&lt; 0.01 or P&lt; 0.05); and there were no differences between groups B and D at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: K(ATP) opener can significantly decrease the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 mRNAs following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be decreased by the inhibition of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-receptor signal pathways </plain></SENT>
