<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor could inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After placebo or trandolapril (5 mg/kg per day) was administered orally for 7 days, we permanently occluded the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACE activity in extracts from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side of placebo-treated rats was significantly higher than that in extracts from the non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side from 5 days after MCAO, though they did not differ at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACE activities in extracts from both hemispheric segments in the trandolapril-treated group were significantly decreased compared with those in the placebo-treated group before MCAO, and this significant reduction persisted even at 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the placebo-treated group, MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side were significantly increased at 12 h and at 1 day after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trandolapril treatment significantly reduced MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities to 68.5% and 53.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAO, the ratios of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas to the hemispheric sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 55.4+/-2.1% and 30.9+/-2.9%, respectively, and this difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological severity scores were significantly improved from 1 to 7 days after MCAO in trandolapril-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative survival in trandolapril-treated rats was significantly increased compared with that in placebo-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the inhibition of MMP-9 by trandolapril might be part of the mechanism that prevents cerebral damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
