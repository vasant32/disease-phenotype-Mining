<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since large arteries like basilar artery contribute significantly to total cerebrovascular resistance and are major determinants of microvascular pressure, dysregulation of basilar artery function may worsen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ET-1 is involved in the regulation of basilar constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> influences vasoreactivity of basilar artery and to what extent ET-1 contributes to basilar vascular dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that ET-1 impairs basilar artery vasorelaxation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury via activation of ET(A) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 3h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 21 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One group received ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> atrasentan (5 mg/kg, i.p.) at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24h, basilar arteries were isolated from control non-stroked, stroked and stroked+atrasentan-treated animals for vascular reactivity measurements using pressurized arteriograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>)-induced maximum relaxation (R(max)) was decreased in stroked animals as compared to non-stroked group and ET(A) antagonism partially restored it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend for decreased EC(50) value for the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> treatment group indicating improved <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that I/R not only affects vessels distal to the occlusion but also impairs relaxation of proximal large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ET-1-mediated basilar artery dysfunction may contribute to neurovascular damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and early restoration of vascular function by ET receptor antagonism after I/R injury may offer a therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
