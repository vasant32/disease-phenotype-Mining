<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhances neurogenesis in ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in most circumstances, endogenous VEGF expression is limited and insufficient to prevent brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We transferred the VEGF gene into brain tissue with recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (rAAV1) vectors and determined the effect of VEGF expression on neurogenesis and recovery of neurological function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups (n = 32) of Sprague Dawley rats received intraventricular injection of AAV1-VEGF or AAV1-lacZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one days after gene transfer, rats underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and neurological severity score was measured 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was used to identify the quantity and distribution of VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence for doublecortin and bromodeoxyuridine or neuronal nuclei was performed to detect neurogenesis and the migration of neural progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF expression reduced the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also enhanced the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and promoted their migration to the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neural precursors in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus were also increased; however, most of these cells did not move to the ischemic lesion and integrated with their region of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rAAV1-mediated expression of VEGF in the rat brain reduces the size of the infarcted lesion and promotes recovery of neurological function, likely by enhancing neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and promoting neural precursor migration to brain tissue around the core of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
