<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine if BW619C89 inhibits <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and is neuroprotective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produced by proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined at 24 hr after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion from 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolim <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with BW619C89 (10, 20, 30 and 50 mg/kg i.v. of mesylate salt) decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a dose-dependent fashion maximal at 30 mg/kg compared to saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 30 mg/kg up to 45 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion also was effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microdialysate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in rats treated with 30 mg/kg of drug before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was decreased in both caudate (ischemic core) and rostral cortex (penumbra) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BW619C89 did not induce significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo>, except when it was administered by rapid bolus administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was transient and did not reduce efficacy or superficial cortical blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BW619C89 did not induce the 72 kD heat shock protein in cingulate gyrus or retrosplenial cortex as did MK801, suggesting that BW619C89 does not injure neurons in these regions as do <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release by BW619C89 may be an effective and nontoxic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
