<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides neuroprotection, inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> also can be a method to protect the brain against ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sesame is reported to have various beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of defatted sesame seed extract (DSE) in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) rat model were reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study was planned to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects of DSE is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tMCAo rat model was used to investigate the brain water content (BWC) and Evans blue (EB) leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions at 4 and 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro zymography was performed to investigate the effects on MMPs activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DSE (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced BWC but not EB leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSE inhibited AQP4 expression at 4 h but not at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It did not show any effects on MMPs expressions and activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DSE might be effective on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> by AQP4 regulation during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
