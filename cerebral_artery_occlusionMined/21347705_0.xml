<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic goal in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is to reduce the extent of brain injury and thus minimize neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), an active component of Gastrodia elata Blume, on transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced brain injury with respect to the involvement of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were ovariectomized 14 days before ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury was induced for 1 h by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days before MCAO, the vehicle-treated and the HBA-treated groups received intramuscular sesame oil and HBA (25 mg/kg BW), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining showed decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the ischemic lesion of HBA-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HBA pretreatment also promoted functional recovery, as measured by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, expression of PDI, Nrf2, BDNF, GDNF, and MBP genes increased by HBA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced PC12 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was prevented by 24 h HBA treatment, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">bacitracin</z:chebi>, a PDI inhibitor, attenuated this cytoprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HBA treatment for 2 h also induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, possibly activating the intracellular antioxidative system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HBA protects against brain damage by modulating cytoprotective genes, such as Nrf2 and PDI, and neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
