<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine time-dependent changes of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate (NOx) concentration in the circulation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation as well as the expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) in the penumbra of rat brains during transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of Wistar rat for 2 h and reperfusion for 4-70 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NOx concentration in the circulation was continuously monitored at the right jugular vein by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of iNOS was detected at 22-70 h after reperfusion in vascular walls and the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine, a marker of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, appeared 4 h after reperfusion in the cortex, increasing substantially at 22-46 h in vascular walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NOx level in dialysate increased immediately after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a gradual decrease, the level increased again 4 h after reperfusion, reaching a maximum at 46 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration, was not detected 4 h after reperfusion, but greatly increased at 22 h and then decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a marked increase of NOx level in the circulation might reflect the expression of iNOS, while neuronal NOS may contribute to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation in the cortex observed at an earlier phase of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that monitoring NOx level in the circulation serves to assess the progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to determine appropriate therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
