<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with the use of the suture technique causes hypothalamic damage with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, which can confound neuroprotective drug studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the neuroprotective effects of dizocilpine (MK-801) were compared in different permanent MCAO models with and without hypothalamic damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with MK-801 or placebo, beginning 15 minutes before MCAO, and assigned to the following groups: suture MCAO (group I), macrosphere MCAO without hypothalamic damage (group II), or macrosphere MCAO with intentionally induced hypothalamic infarction (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was measured at 3, 6, and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was determined after 24 hours (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypothalamic damage was present in animals in group I and was intentionally induced in group III with the use of a modified macrosphere MCAO technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was significantly increased 3, 6, and 24 hours after MCAO in these 2 groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypothalamic damage and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> could be avoided effectively by limiting the number of macrospheres (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MK-801 provided a highly significant neuroprotective effect in group II but not in groups I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypothalamic damage with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> masked the neuroprotective effect of MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This side effect can be avoided by using the macrosphere MCAO technique with a limited number of spheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This model therefore may be more appropriate to study the effects of neuroprotective drugs in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> than the suture method </plain></SENT>
