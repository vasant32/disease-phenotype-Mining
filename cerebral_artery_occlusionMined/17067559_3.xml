<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have previously reported that CVCD before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> decreases the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in spontaneously hypertensive rats by filament insertion through the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into the following four groups: sham-operated, mild or severe venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> (VC), and DPCPX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DPCPX group received the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) prior to mild VC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavior, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and S-100 protein were evaluated among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume rates in mild VC and severe VC groups were significantly less than that in sham-operated and DPCPX groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mortality of the severe VC group worsened in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the mild VC group compared to the DPCPX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Behavioral scores also indicated that the mild VC group had fewer neurological deficits than the other three groups, including the DPCPX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We were able to induce rapid cerebral protection via <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor activation by administering an appropriate degree of VC prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our work suggests possible mechanisms by which such effective VC may lead to cerebral protection and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor activation </plain></SENT>
