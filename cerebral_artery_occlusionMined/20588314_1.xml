<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten cynomolgus monkeys underwent PWI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 and 47 hours, respectively, after right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion using <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils, and were killed at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volumes of the hypoperfused areas on PWI were automatically measured using different thresholds and 11 parametric maps to determine the optimum threshold (at which least difference was found between the average volumes on PWI and those determined using specimens or DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of arrival time (AT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), time to maximum (T(max)), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) determined using deconvolution techniques, the volume of the hypoperfused area significantly correlated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and the neurologic deficit scores with small variations, whereas in the case of mean transit time and nondeconvolution CBF, relatively poor correlations with large variations were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At optimum threshold, AT, CBV, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, T(max), and deconvolution CBF can accurately predict the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurologic outcome in monkeys with permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
