<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate MRI for noninvasive autopsy by means of measurements of serial changes in relaxation parameters of the rat brain during the postmortem interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmortem relaxometry measurements were performed before and hourly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for 24 h on five control rats and five rats that underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed on representative regions of gray, white, and mixed gray/white matter structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant decreases in both T(1) and T(2) values were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas in the control group within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals, T(2) differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic striatal tissue decreased by 11 +/- 4% (P &lt; 0.01), with a complete convergence of T(2) values observed between ischemic striatal tissue and nonischemic cortical tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lesion conspicuity and the ability to differentiate between different tissue compartments are significantly affected by postmortem interval, and alterations to pulse timing parameters will be necessary if the sensitivity of MRI to detect central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system diseases in postmortem tissue is to be maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at least, convergence of T(2) values with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue post mortem indicates that T(1)-weighted images may be more sensitive to the presence of such lesions </plain></SENT>
