<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded for a period of 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> based on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the EEG 30 min after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following release of the clip, the animals were allowed to recover for a week during which time daily neurological examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> was injected for the determination of LCMRglc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternative blocks were processed for histological evaluation in which both neuronal and phagocytic changes were graded into four categories (0 = <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to 3 = severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LCMRglc (mumol/100 g/min) in the ischemic hemisphere (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histological grades) was significantly lower than the metabolic rate in comparable regions of the sham <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions with significant phagocytosis (grade 2 and 3) invariably exhibited activated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (57.4 +/- 8.4 and 105.9 +/- 6.8 mumol/100 g/min, respectively), which was significantly higher than in regions without phagocytosis (30.4 +/- 0.8 mumol/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant gradient of metabolism in the central, peripheral, and boundary zone and the non-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in the animals with severe ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LCMRglc in the central <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was well correlated with the EEG amplitude changes (r = 0.82, p less than 0.05) and the morphological score (r = -0.89, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The metabolic rate was significantly depressed in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral central <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories in comparison with the sham occlusion animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in LCMRglc in the contralateral hemisphere correlated well with the concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the contralateral EEG amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that local <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> metabolic alterations and contralateral cortical diaschisis exist chronically following temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and that the increases in local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be due to phagocytotic activity </plain></SENT>
