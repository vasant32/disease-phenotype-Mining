<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficacy of pretreatment with the recently developed intracellular calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AT877 against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was investigated in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion using the endovascular suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-induced moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (60 mm Hg) was used during 100 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the treated animals (n = 10), an intravenous infusion of AT877 (0.03 mg/kg per minute) was initiated 30 minutes before the ischemic event and continued during the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control rats (n = 10) received physiological saline in a similar fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations were performed daily during the 48-hour observation period, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A continuous infusion of AT877 significantly improved local cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treated animals showed a better neurological outcome after a 24-hour observation period, and a significant reduction in ischemic brain injury resulted in both the neocortex (149 +/- 20 versus 41 +/- 14 mm3, P &lt; .01) and the striatum (80 +/- 5 versus 46 +/- 8 mm3, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of the neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was reduced, with increasing mean ischemic cerebral blood flow in the control and treated animals (r = .923, P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AT877 pretreatment was effective in preventing brain injury during transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and improving neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This beneficial effect seems to be mediated, in part, by its primary action of increasing cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
