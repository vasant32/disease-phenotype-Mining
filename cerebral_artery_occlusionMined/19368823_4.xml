<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (PROG) metabolite allopregnanolone (AP) is more potent than PROG in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the mechanisms for this differential effect are little understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (mtPTP) appears to be a key player in the intrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-induced loss of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its activation is accompanied by the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c) from the intermembrane gap and subsequent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mtPTP is implicated in the mechanisms of PROG and AP neuroprotection following traumatic and ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the neurosteroids' direct effects on mtPTP activity at the single-channel level, recordings from the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane were obtained by a patch-clamp approach in rat liver mitoplasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AP but not PROG strongly inhibited mtPTP currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interaction of AP with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> was further supported by a swelling assay demonstrating that AP inhibited Ca(2+)-triggered swelling in functionally intact rat liver and brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If AP inhibits the mtPTP, it should prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c release seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test this idea, we subjected one group of rats to cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> injury (CCI) and another to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AP-treated animals showed substantially decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c release and AP was more potent than PROG in inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c release at 24 h post-CCI and -MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that AP inhibits the mtPTP current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may help to explain its more potent anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects compared to PROG </plain></SENT>
