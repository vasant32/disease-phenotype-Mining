<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Synaptic transmission is highly vulnerable to metabolic perturbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term consequences of transient metabolic perturbations on synapses are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission and phosphorylation of presynaptic proteins in penumbral cortical neurons after transient moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, electric activity of neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region was recorded intracellularly and extracellularly in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of synapsin-I and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> was studied by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurons in the penumbra displayed no postsynaptic potentials 1 to 3 hours after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these cells were able to generate action potentials and were responsive to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, suggesting that postsynaptic excitability was preserved but the synaptic transmission was blocked because of a presynaptic defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The synaptic transmission was still depressed 24 hours after recirculation in neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area that survived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amount of immunoreactive synapsin-I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin was not appreciably changed for 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, phosphorylation of synapsin-l was significantly decreased, whereas phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity was increased, suggesting a selective defect in synapsin-I phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that synaptic transmission may be permanently impaired after transient moderate brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since postsynaptic excitability is preserved, the transmission failure is likely to be caused by presynaptic mechanisms, one of which may be impaired phosphorylation of presynaptic proteins </plain></SENT>
