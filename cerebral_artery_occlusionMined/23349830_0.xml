<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine and threonine phosphatase that contributes broadly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> regulates PP2A subunit B in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) animal model and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity-induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MCAO was surgically induced to yield permanent cerebral ischemic injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were treated with either vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, i.v.) immediately after MCAO, and cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A proteomics approach, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses performed to identification of PP2A subunit B expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> significantly reduced the MCAO-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A proteomics approach elucidated the reduction of PP2A subunit B in MCAO-induced animals, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment prevented the injury-induced reduction in PP2A subunit B levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses also showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment attenuates the injury-induced decrease in PP2A subunit B levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of PP2A subunit B-positive cells was reduced in MCAO-induced animals, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented these decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cultured neuronal cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment protected cells against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity and prevented the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced decrease in PP2A subunit B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that the maintenance of PP2A subunit B by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> in ischemic brain injury plays an important role for the neuroprotective function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
