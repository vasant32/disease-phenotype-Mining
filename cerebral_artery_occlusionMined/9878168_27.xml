<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization and tissue levels of BDNF protein were studied using immunocytochemistry and enzyme immunoassay, respectively, in the cortex and striatum at different reperfusion times (0-24 h) after 2 h of unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of neuronal injury was analyzed in NeuN-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-, and Fluoro-Jade-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 2 h postischemia, but not at later time points, there was a several-fold increase of the number of BDNF-immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the ipsilateral cingulate and frontal cortices outside the damaged area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals with cortical injury showed loss of BDNF-ir fibers in the striatum at 2-24 h, whereas rats with cell damage confined to the striatum exhibited no such change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2-16 h, strongly BDNF-ir fibers were observed along the myelinated fascicles medially in the striatum, in the anterior commissure, and in the corpus callosum ipsilateral to the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BDNF protein levels were increased (by 133-213%) at 2 h in the cingulate and frontal cortices and decreased (by 40%) at 24 h in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show that the increased expression of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cortical neurons previously demonstrated after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is accompanied by elevated levels of BDNF protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rapid decline of BDNF protein levels suggests a pronounced release or anterograde axonal transport in the postischemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction of BDNF protein in the striatum of animals with cortical damage provides further evidence for anterograde transport, which is also supported by the accumulation of BDNF protein in several preterminal fiber systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes of BDNF protein after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> could play a role for survival and plasticity of cortical and striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
