<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accommodation was monitored by an infrared optometer with the accommodative target being controlled by a microcomputer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography showed low-density areas in the left cortex, with intact brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339656" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">convergence palsy</z:e> and accommodation abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the accommodative responses was reduced and the accommodation velocity was markedly lowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results further substantiate the neurologic relationship between the cerebral cortex and accommodation and convergence </plain></SENT>
