<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight animals underwent SHAM surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were evaluated post-operatively for 14 days using seven neurological tests, including water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SALINE animals exhibited a pattern of neurological impairment compared to SHAMs (poor performance in five of the six motor/reflex tests) peaking five days post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to the SALINE group, the MDL group exhibited significantly improved outcome on two of the tests and a pattern of improved behavior on the remainder of the battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By day 14 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups exhibited recovery on the motor/reflex tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Learning ability was disrupted in the SALINE group on days 17 and 18, whereas the MDL group's performance was not distinguishable from the SHAM group in the water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a neuroprotective dose of MDL 100,453 produced a pattern of behavioral sparing in the immediate post-ischemic days that was uniquely different than saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of behavioral outcome measures to histological neuroprotection data adds significantly to the ability to better evaluate a putative neuroprotective compound </plain></SENT>
