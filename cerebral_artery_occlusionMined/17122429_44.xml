<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that activated microglia are detrimental to the survival of new hippocampal neurons, whereas blocking <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> has been shown to restore hippocampal neurogenesis after cranial irradiation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this current study is to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on neurogenesis and functional recovery after cerebral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four days after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BrdU was given on days 4 to 7 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to track cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of remaining new neurons and activated microglia were quantified in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured to assess the treatment effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor and cognitive functions were evaluated 6 weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> delivered 4 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 4 weeks did not result in reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size but significantly decreased the number of activated microglia in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> also significantly increased the number of newborn neurons that coexpressing BrdU and NeuN without significantly affecting progenitor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> significantly improved motor coordination on the rotor rod, reduced the preferential use of the unaffected limb during exploration, reduced the frequency of footfalls in the affected limb when traversing on a horizontal ladder, and improved spatial learning and memory in the water maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> reduces functional impairment caused by cerebral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The improved function is associated with enhanced neurogenesis and reduced microglia activation in the dentate gyrus and possibly improved neural environment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
