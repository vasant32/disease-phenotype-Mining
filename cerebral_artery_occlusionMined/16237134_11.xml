<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively determine if the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perfusion or diffusion abnormalities measured prior to treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> help predict the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On parametric maps obtained in 64 patients (mean age, 64 years +/- 13 [standard deviation]; 37 men and 27 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, lesion volumetry was performed to determine time to peak, mean transit time, cerebral blood volume, and apparent diffusion coefficient obtained within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions were assessed on T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained at follow-up on day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular changes were determined on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inferential and correlation statistics were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A perfusion delay of more than 6 seconds relative to the nonaffected hemisphere on time-to-peak maps helped to predict the lesion volume on T2-weighted images (r = 0.686, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither the volume nor the degree of the diffusion abnormality helped to predict the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r &lt; 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was because in one subgroup of patients there was an increase and in one subgroup there was a decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on the T2-weighted images (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a greater prevalence (P &lt; .02) of cerebral artery abnormalities in the patients with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the neurologic impairment was more severe (P &lt; .01) and the mean arterial pressure higher (P &lt; .04) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the severity of the initial ischemic event as determined on time-to-peak maps indicates hemodynamic compromise in addition to internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, because of abnormalities in other cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
