<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The normally occurring electron transport radicals require adequate molecular oxygen for orderly transport of electrons and protons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decrease in tissue oxygen removes the controls over the electron transport radicals, and allows them to initiate pathologic radical reactions among cell membranes such as mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologic radical reactions result in multiple products, each of which may be present in too small a concentration to permit their detection at early time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible to follow the time course, however, by the decrease of a major <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> as it is consumed by the pathologic radical reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this reason, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> was measured in ischemic and control brain following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive decrease in the amount of detectable <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> ranging from 25% at 1 hour to 65% at 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction of this normally occurring <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and free radical scavenger may indicate consumption of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> in an attempt to quench pathologic free radical reactions occurring within the components of cytomembranes </plain></SENT>
