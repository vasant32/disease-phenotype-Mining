<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporal and spatial changes of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor were investigated after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in relation to those of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and ApoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor became positive at 1 d after transient MCAO, which was not double positive for MAP2 or ApoE, and disappeared in 7 and 56 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the peri-ischemic area, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor became observed at 7 d, which peaked at 21 d, most of which were double positive for MAP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor and ApoE double-positive cells increased at 7 d and decreased at 21 d with the shift of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor immunoreactivity from cytoplasm at 7 d to dendrites at 21 d in the peri-ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor, interacting with ApoE, is profoundly involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> transport of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> for tissue repair in the peri-ischemic area after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
