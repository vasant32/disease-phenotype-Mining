<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> tanshinone B (STB) on brain damage following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) injury through interfering with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartic acid</z:chebi> receptor (NMDAR) and excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, and evaluate the potential mechanisms of the neuroprotective activity of STB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomized into a sham operated group, a model group (I/R) and three STB different dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were pretreated with STB at the doses of 4, 8, 16 mg/kg (STB(1), STB(2), STB(3)) for 3 days before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of NMDAR1 was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and Î³-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: STB treatment reduced neurological defect scores, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume and brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of NMDAR1 were significantly higher in the l/R and STB(1) groups than that of the sham and the STB(3) groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optical density of NMDAR1 was significantly increased in cornu ammonis (CA)1 region of the l/R group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>STB treatment reduced NMDAR1 optical density in the CA1 region (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were significantly lower in the hippocampus in the STB(3) group than that of the l/R, STB(1) and STB(2) groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preconditioning with STB appears to be a simple and promising strategy to reduce or even prevent cerebral l/R injury and has potential for future clinical application </plain></SENT>
