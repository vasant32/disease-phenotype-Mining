<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>No study so far has attempted to map the 3D topography of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the individual rat in vivo following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous microPET study, we reported that (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-MISO) trapping in the brain after MCAo was specific for the hypoxic viable tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used (18)F-MISO microPET to map the 3D topography of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of permanent distal MCAo in individual spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> rats were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(18)F-MISO was intravenously injected approximately 1 h after clip placement and PET data were acquired for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed and the brains harvested 48 h later for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mapping using standard histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, continuous (18)F-MISO trapping was found over the affected relative to unaffected and control <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using single-subject voxel-based statistical mapping, tracer accumulation 90-120 min after injection was consistently significantly higher in the anterior <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortex (proximal relative to clip site) and gradually decreased towards posterior areas, a pattern consistent with the classic penumbra concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data also suggested that (i) a portion of the significant (18)F-MISO trapping area may sit outside the contours of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> despite the permanent MCAo, suggesting that (18)F-MISO may be a marker not only of severe (penumbral) but also of milder (oligemic) <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and (ii) small portions of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may not exhibit early tracer trapping, suggesting that by the time the tracer was administered this tissue had already progressed to irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows the feasibility of single-subject mapping of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> following MCAo in the rat, which has potential applications in pathophysiological investigations </plain></SENT>
