<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Motoneuronotrophic factor (MNTF) is an endogenous neurotrophin that is highly specific for the human <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and some of the observed effects of MNTF include motoneuron differentiation, maintenance, survival, and reinnervation of target muscles and organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MNTF is a neuro-signaling molecule that binds to specific receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using In Silico Analysis, one of the active sites of MNTF was identified as an analog of six amino acids (GM6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of chemically synthesized GM6 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was studied in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to 1 hur of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were injected intravenously with a bolus of GM6, at various doses (1 and 5 mg/kg) immediately after the start of reperfusion and examined for changes in physiological parameters, neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM6 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, and at both 1 and 5 mg/kg showed a significant protection from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage, which translated to improvement of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of GM6 demonstrated no changes in HR, BP, pO(2), pCO(2), or pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant increase over the control group in CBF after reperfusion was observed with GM6 administration, which helped to mitigate the ischemic effect caused by the blockage of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time window of treatment was assessed at various times following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with GM6 demonstrating a significant protective effect up to 6-12 h post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, GM6 increased neurogenesis, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the mouse brain following cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GM6 is neuroprotective to the brain following IV injection in the mouse model of MCAo </plain></SENT>
