<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and others have reported recently that drugs which activate PPARgamma are effective in reducing damage to brain in distinct models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the cell type responsible for PPARgamma-mediated protection has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, PPARgamma gene is robustly upregulated in neurons, suggesting that neuronal PPARgamma may be a primary target for PPARgamma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To understand the contribution of neuronal PPARgamma to ischemic injury, we generated conditional neuron-specific PPARgamma knock-out mice (N-PPARgamma-KO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mice are viable and appeared to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with respect to their gross behavior and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, neuronal PPARgamma deficiency caused these mice to experience significantly more brain damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in response to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary cortical neurons harvested from N-PPARgamma-KO mice, but not astroglia, exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vitro demonstrated more damage and a reduced expression of numerous key gene products that could explain increased vulnerability, including SOD1 (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase 1), catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase, uncoupling protein-1, or transcription factor liver X receptor-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-based neuroprotective effect was lost in neurons from N-PPARgamma neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that PPARgamma in neurons play an essential protective function and that PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may have utility in neuronal self-defense, in addition to their well established anti-inflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
