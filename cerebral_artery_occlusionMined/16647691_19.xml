<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When artificially over-expressed, NGB reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size observed after transient Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study addresses the post-ischemic NGB expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) were randomized to tMCAo (n = 6) or sham (n = 4), and euthanized 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NGB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined by means of quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Reaction (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen animals subjected to either 90 min tMCAo (n = 7) or sham (n = 6) surgery, were euthanized 1 week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic expression of NGB and the neuronal marker NeuN was studied using free-floating immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Design-based stereological quantification of NGB- and NeuN-positive cells in the striatum was performed using the optical fractionator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly less NGB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in the ischemic hemispheres of tMCAo animals after 24 h (P &lt; or = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the protein level, we found a significantly lower number of NGB- and NeuN-positive striatal neurons in tMCAo rats (P &lt; or = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NGB expression was mainly confined to the hypothalamus and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Less than one out of every two thousand neurons expressed NGB in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic territory we did not observe selective sparing of NGB expressing neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant change in the NGB/NeuN ratio was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that endogenous expressed NGB does not provide protection against ischemic injury induced by tMCAo in SHRs </plain></SENT>
