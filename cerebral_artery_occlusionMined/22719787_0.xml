<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether gongjin-dan improves functional recovery and has neuroprotective effects on reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured using TTC staining and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization by F-18 FDG PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional improvement was evaluated with the Rota-rod, treadmill, Garcia score test, and adhesive removal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 14 days after MCAo, neuronal cell survival, astrocytes expansion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed by immunohistofluorescence staining in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the expression of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, BDNF, Cox-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-1α was measured in ischemic hemisphere regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gongjin-dan-treated group showed both reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavior tests demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also in the gongjin-dan treated group, NeuN-positive cells were increased and number of astrocytes, microglia, and apoptotic cells was significantly decreased compared with the control group in the ischemic peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of VEGF and BDNF was increased and level of Cox-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-1α was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that gongjin-dan may improve functional outcome through the rapid restoration of metabolism and can be considered as a potential neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
