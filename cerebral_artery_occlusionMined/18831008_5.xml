<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detachment of the microvascular basement membrane (BM) from the astrocyte, as well as degradation of the BM, is responsible for the loss of microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their ultrastructural and temporal changes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using transmission electron microscopy, the proportion of intact BM-astrocyte contacts and electron densities of the BM were measured from five randomly selected microvessels in the ischemic basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their temporal changes and associations with activities of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intact portion of the BM-astrocyte contacts was decreased significantly within 4 hr and was rarely observed at 48 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreases in the electron density and degradation of the BM were significant 12 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intact BM-astrocyte contacts and the mean BM density showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.784, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 activity was correlated negatively with the intact BM-astrocyte contacts (r = -0.711, P &lt; 0.001) and with the BM density (r = -0.538, P = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in MMP-9 coincided temporally with the loss of the BM-astrocyte contacts and a decrease in the BM density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural alterations occurring in the microvascular BM and its contacts with astrocyte endfeet were temporally associated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Time courses of their alterations should be considered in the treatment targeted to the microvascular BM and its contact with astrocytes </plain></SENT>
