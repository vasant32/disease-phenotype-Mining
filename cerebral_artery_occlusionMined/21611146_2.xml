<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATP may cause cellular degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, mediated by P2X and P2Y receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effects of inhibition of P2 receptors by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxalphosphate</z:chebi>-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) on electrophysiological, functional and morphological alterations in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were investigated up to day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats received PPADS or vehicle intracerebroventricularly 15 minutes prior MCAO for up to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery monitored by qEEG was improved by PPADS indicated by an accelerated recovery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced qEEG changes in the delta and alpha frequency bands along with a faster and sustained recovery of motor impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas the functional improvements by PPADS were persistent at day 28, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging and the amount of TUNEL-positive cells were significantly reduced by PPADS only until day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we identified both neurons and astrocytes as TUNEL-positive after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The persistent beneficial effect of PPADS on the functional parameters without differences in the late (day 28) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> suggests that the early inhibition of P2 receptors might be favourable for the maintenance or early reconstruction of neuronal connectivity in the periinfarct area after ischemic incidents </plain></SENT>
