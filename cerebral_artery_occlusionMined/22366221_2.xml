<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> is one of the most robust experimental neuroprotective interventions against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of molecular pathways and gene networks together with single genes or gene families that are significantly associated with neuroprotection might help unravel the mechanisms of therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a microarray analysis of ischemic rat brains that underwent 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced for 4 h, starting 1 h after MCAO in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 h, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumetry, and functional outcome was determined by a neuroscore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain gene expression profile of sham (S), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (I), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (HI) treatment were compared by analyzing changes of individual genes, pathways, and networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on selected genes to validate the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats treated with HI had significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neuroscores at 48 h compared with I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 4067 genes present on the array chip, HI compared with I upregulated 50 (1.23%) genes and downregulated 103 (3.20%) genes equal or greater than twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New genes potentially mediating neuroprotection by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> were HNRNPAB, HIG-1, and JAK3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the pathway level, HI globally suppressed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-driven gene response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve gene networks were identified to be significantly altered by HI compared with I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most significantly altered network contained genes participating in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> at the pathway level restored gene expression to sham levels, it selectively regulated the expression of several genes implicated in protein synthesis and folding, calcium homeostasis, cellular and synaptic integrity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
