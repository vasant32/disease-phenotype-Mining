<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear if delayed treatment with a PTEN inhibitor improves long-term functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed the issue in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male mice were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by treatment with a well-established PTEN inhibitor bpv or saline daily for 14 days, starting at 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was assessed with behavioral tests and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed bpv treatment did not reduce infarction during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, but significantly improved long-term functional recovery after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since PTEN is a critical intrinsic inhibitory factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo>, we further examined bpv effects on axonal densities following MCAO using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bielschowsky</z:e> silver staining and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against myelin basic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed bpv treatment significantly increased axon densities in the ischemic brain at 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PTEN expression persistently remained high in the ischemic brain over 14 days after MCAO, and bpv treatment increased post-ischemic activation of Akt and mTOR in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Akt and mTOR activation are the well-established cascades downstream to PTEN inhibition and have been shown to contribute to post-injury axonal regrowth in response to PTEN inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistently, in an in vitro neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model, bpv enhanced axonal outgrowth of primary cortical neurons after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and the enhancing effects were abolished by Akt/mTOR inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, delayed bpv treatment improved functional recovery from experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> possibly via enhancing axonal growth and Akt/mTOR activation contributed to bpv-enhanced post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> axon growth </plain></SENT>
