<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to transient (2 hours) clip occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion times ranged from 1.5 min to 46 hours, and i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3H-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> was circulated for 30 min prior to each time point (1 h, 4 h, 22 h, and 46 h; n = 5-7 per time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ki was calculated from the ratio of parenchymal tracer uptake and the time-integrated plasma concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional groups of rats (n = 7-8) were maintained either normothermic (37.5 degrees C) or hypothermic (32.5 degrees C or 28.5 degrees C) for the first 6 hours of reperfusion, and Ki was measured at 46 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats injected after 1.5-2 min exhibited a 10-fold increase in Ki for cortical regions supplied by the right middle cerebral artery (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This barrier opening had closed within 1 to 4 hours post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 22 hours, the blood-brain barrier had re-opened, with further opening 22 and 46 hours (p &lt; 0.01), resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (28 degrees C-29 degrees C) during the first six hours of reperfusion prevented opening, reducing Ki by over 50% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> evokes a marked biphasic opening of the cortical blood-brain barrier, the second phase of which causes vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the late opening of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This opening of the blood-brain barrier may enhance delivery of low permeability neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
