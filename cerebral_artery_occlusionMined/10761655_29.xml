<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The use of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has yielded surprisingly modest success, possibly because of reperfusion injury mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, scavenging ROS may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">Nitroxides</z:chebi> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low-weight</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase mimics, which allows them to act as cell-permeable <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxide</z:chebi> 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol) is investigated to determine its ability to reduce reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 280 g and 350 g underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with an intraluminal suture for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow, blood pressure, cerebral temperature, and rectal temperature were monitored during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, the animals were randomized to groups receiving blinded intravenous administration of either Tempol (10 mg/kg; eight animals) or vehicle (eight animals) over the first 20 minutes of reperfusion (Study I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second study to determine dose dependency, animals were randomized to groups receiving Tempol (20 mg/kg; eight animals), low-dose Tempol (5 mg/kg; eight animals), or vehicle (eight animals; Study II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed after 4 hours of reperfusion, and brain sections were stained with 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured using digital imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving Tempol had significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg compared with controls (49.01+/-18.22% reduction [p = 0.003] and 47.47+/-34.57 [p = 0.02], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the physiological variables measured were observed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tempol provides significant neuroprotection after reperfusion in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results support the importance of ROS in reperfusion injury and encourage further study of this molecule as a therapeutic agent following thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
