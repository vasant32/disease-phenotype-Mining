<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microplasmin (μPli), a derivative of plasmin lacking the five "kringle" domains, was administered in this model, and its effect was studied using magnetic resonance imaging. μPli treatment reduced cerebral damage 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; it also reduced the expansion of the positive area on perfusion-weighted images between 1 and 24 h and the degree of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), a serine proteinase that converts plasminogen to plasmin, has been approved for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but delayed treatment is associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasmin participates in the degradation of fibrin, causing clot lysis, and of various extracellular matrix proteins, either directly or via the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed that MMP-3 is relatively important in the enhanced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> induced by delayed t-PA treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the binding of t-PA with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor-related protein (LRP) results in the release of MMP-3 by endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LRP production is upregulated in endothelial cells exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and elevated LRP levels have been implicated in the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> risk associated with delayed t-PA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies that the t-PA/LRP/MMP-3 pathway may be a suitable target for developing strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of t-PA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
