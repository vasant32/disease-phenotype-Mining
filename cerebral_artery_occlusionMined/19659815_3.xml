<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has focused attention on accurate identification of injured vs. salvageable brain tissue, particularly if reperfusion occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, our knowledge of differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> magnetic resonance imaging changes between transient and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and how they reflect permanently damaged tissue remain incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS: Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics vary widely following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> times, T1, T2 or apparent diffusion coefficient quantification may differentiate viable tissue from that destined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 9.4 T following permanent or transient (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in spontaneously hypertensive male rats or Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 30 min, quantified maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient, T1, and T2 were performed and measures determined for sequences in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and compared with that in the contralateral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion area for each magnetic resonance imaging sequence (T1, T2, apparent diffusion coefficient, and perfusion maps) was delineated for different time points using quantitative threshold measures and compared with final histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early extensive changes in T1 following both transient and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> provided a sensitive early indicator of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following reperfusion, small but measurable early T2 changes indicative of early development of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> occurred in the transient but not permanent groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, at 70 min apparent diffusion coefficient decreased (P&lt;0.001) and then pseudonormalized at 150 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, apparent diffusion coefficient declined over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesion area detected using T1 maps exceeded that with T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient at 70 and 150 min in both groups (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that, independent of reperfusion, quantified T1 is superior for detecting early ischemic changes that are not necessarily detected with T2 or apparent diffusion coefficient </plain></SENT>
