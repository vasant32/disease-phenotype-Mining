<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, is attributable to the increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> benefit from the neuroprotective drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, a free radical scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> may help to suppress rtPA-induced brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats weighing 250 to 280 g were subjected to 3-hour transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and divided randomly into 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion, 1 group was intravenously injected with 10 mg/kg rtPA, another with rtPA plus 3 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, and the 3rd group received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume and the activity of MMP-9 in the brain 24 hours postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied the activity of MMP-9, its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity in rtPA-stimulated human microvascular endothelial cells (HBECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and the level of endothelial cell-derived MMP-9 were elevated in rats treated with rtPA alone and attenuated in rats treated with rtPA plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In rtPA-stimulated HBECs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> suppressed the activity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> also inhibited NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> inhibits rtPA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the ischemic brain of rats via the inhibition of MMP-9 expression in vivo, which is substantiated by inhibition of MMP-9 expression and NF-kappaB activation in HBECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> may render thrombolytic therapy safer for the administration of rtPA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
