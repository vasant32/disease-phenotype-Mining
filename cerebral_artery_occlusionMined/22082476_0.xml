<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The soluble recombinant analogue of human thrombomodulin, Solulin, was studied in an in vivo rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male SD rats were subjected to 2 hrs of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with Solulin intravenously shortly before reperfusion were compared to rats receiving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline i.v. with respect to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, neurological deficits and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-9, CD11B and GFAP were semiquantitatively analyzed by rtPCR of the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 hrs after reperfusion, rats were neurologically tested, euthanized and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Solulin significantly reduced mean total (p=0.001), cortical (p=0.002), and basal ganglia (p=0.036) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (p=0.191) were not significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Solulin significantly downregulated the expression of IL-1β (79%; p&lt;0.001), TNF-α (59%; p=0.001), IL-6 (47%; p=0.04), and CD11B (49%; p=0.001) in the infarcted cortex compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Solulin reduced mean total, cortical and basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and regulated a subset of cytokines and proteases after tMCAO suggesting the potency of this compound for therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
