<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether the induction of 72-kDa heat shock protein expression by an ischemic event improves neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we outlined the temporal profile of neuronal induction and expression of the 72-kDa heat shock protein in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty two adult Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 2 h duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 0.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h after reopening the artery, coronal brain sections were analyzed using both immunohistochemical methods and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining to determine the topographic and cellular distribution of the 72-kDa heat shock protein, as well as the extent of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity to the 72-kDa heat shock protein was not detected in neurons that were destined to become necrotic, and were located in the ischemic core of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 72-kDa heat shock protein expression was evident in morphologically intact neurons located in the peripheral zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The earliest neuronal expression of 72-kDa heat shock protein was detected in animals in which the 2 h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was followed by 6 h recirculation; the intensity of the 72-kDa heat shock protein immunoreactivity peaked at 48 h, and progressively disappeared 7 days after the ischemic reperfusion event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
