<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied functional disturbances following left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuronal function was evaluated by [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> autoradiography 1 day after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the mechanisms of change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> using Fink-Heimer silver impregnation, axonal transport of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated-horseradish peroxidase, and succinate dehydrogenase histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after occlusion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was remarkably reduced in the areas surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were many silver grains indicating degeneration of the synaptic terminals in the cortical areas surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the ipsilateral cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the left thalamus where the left middle cerebral artery supplied no blood, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization significantly decreased compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the left thalamus, massive silver staining of degenerated synaptic terminals and decreases in succinate dehydrogenase activity were observed 4 and 5 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of succinate dehydrogenase staining may reflect early changes in retrograde degeneration of thalamic neurons after ischemic injury of the thalamocortical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Terminal degeneration even affected areas remote from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: there were silver grains in the contralateral hemisphere transcallosally connected to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in the ipsilateral substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Axonal transport study showed disruption of the corticospinal tract by subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; the transcallosal pathways in the cortex surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relation between neural function and the neuronal network in the area surrounding the focal cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is discussed with regard to ischemic penumbra and diaschisis </plain></SENT>
