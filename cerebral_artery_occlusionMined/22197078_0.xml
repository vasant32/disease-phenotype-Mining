<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate galanin, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3 gene expression in the female rat brain 7 days after a 60-min unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time PCR was employed in punch-biopsies from the locus coeruleus, somatosensory cortex and dorsal hippocampal formation, including sham-operated rats as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Galanin gene expression showed a ∼2.5-fold increase and GalR1 a ∼1.5-fold increase in the locus coeruleus of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the control side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the GalR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels decreased by 35% in somatosensory cortex of the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of galanin from cell bodies and dendrites in the locus coeruleus after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced forebrain lesion up-regulates synthesis of galanin and GalR1 in the locus coeruleus, a noradrenergic cell group projecting to many forebrain areas, including cortex and the hippocampal formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the notion that galanin may play a role in the response of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to injury </plain></SENT>
