<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Paw preference in rats is similar to human handedness, which may result from dominant hemisphere of rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, given that lateralization is the uniqueness of the humans, many researchers neglect the differences between the left and right hemispheres when selecting the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the dominant hemisphere on neurobehavioral function and on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume following MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The right-handed male Sprague-Dawley rats asserted by the quadrupedal food-reaching test were subjected to 2 hours <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and then reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological scores were significantly worse in the left MCAO group than that in the right MCAO group at 1 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (p &lt;0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward better neurobehavioral function recovery in the right MCAO group than in the left MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in left MCAO was significantly larger than that in the right (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neurobehavioral function result and the pathological result were consistent with the hypothesis that paw preference in rats is similar to human handedness, and suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in dominant hemisphere caused more significant neurobehavioral consequence than in another hemisphere following MCAO in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry in rat brain should be considered other than being neglected in choice of rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
