<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of rodents with ARL 15896AR extended survival time during exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the rat four-vessel occlusion model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (20 min), oral dosing commencing at reflow, resulted in significant protection of the CA1 hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ARL 15896AR was, however, ineffective in the rat two-vessel occlusion model and in the gerbil models of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the latter due to an inability to attain suitable plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneously hypertensive rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (2 hr plus 22 hr reflow), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dosing with ARL 15896AR (i.p.) beginning from 30 min before or up to 1 hr post-MCAO significantly reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of ARL 15896AR to influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, as well as functional correlates was examined in SHR after 90 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2 weighted magnetic resonance images taken at 2 and 6 days post-MCAO revealed significantly smaller lesion sizes in the group receiving injections with ARL 15896AR beginning 30 min after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subsequently tested (30-42 days post-MCAO) and found to be deficient in skilled use of the forepaws (staircase test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contralateral forepaw was most severely impaired, however, ARL 15896AR treatment prevented motor impairment in only the ipsilateral forepaw </plain></SENT>
