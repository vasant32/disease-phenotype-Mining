<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effects of neurological improvement after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats by a novel therapeutic strategy with FGF-2 gene-transferred MSCs by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were anesthetized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonmodified MSCs, FGF-2-modified MSCs with HSV-1 1764/-4/pR19/ssIL2-FGF-2, or PBS was administered intracerebrally 24 hours after transient right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent behavioral tests for 21 days, and the infarction volume with 2-3-5-triphenylterazolium was detected 3 days and 14 days after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days and 7 days after the MCAO, the FGF-2 production in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the MCAO was measured with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven and 14 days after the MCAO, immunohistochemical staining for FGF-2 was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals receiving FGF-2-modified MSCs demonstrated significant functional recovery compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days after the MCAO, there was a significant reduction in infarction volume only in FGF-2-modified MSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FGF-2 production in the FGF-2-modified MSC-treated brain was significantly higher compared with the other groups at 3 and 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administrated FGF-2-modified MSCs strongly expressed the FGF-2 protein, which was proven by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the FGF-2 gene-modified MSCs with the HSV-1 vector can contribute to remarkable functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with MSCs transplantation alone </plain></SENT>
