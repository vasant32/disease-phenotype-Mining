<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensory-motor, parietal, auditory and olfactory cortices showed a significant reduction (greater than 25%) of l-CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with large dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> group, ischemic cortices showed significant reduction from the only <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group (highest 36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant reduction of l-CBF in the deep structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> on drains with various pathologies have been studied both clinically and experimentally with many kinds of techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects are now being reevaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Still controversial however, is the mechanism that determines whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> has beneficial, non-beneficial, or harmful effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study may help us to unravel the mechanism of steroid effects, as well as the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
