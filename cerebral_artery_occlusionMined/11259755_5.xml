<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perfusion deficit associated with a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by a newly formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was mapped by interrogation of the tissue oxygenation status using gradient echo methods and production of T2* maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was subsequently assessed at 24-h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> by histology with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals displayed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 178.7+/-84.2 mm(3) (mean+/-S.D.) with a large coefficient of variation (47%) and range of values (85.6--265.5 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This variability provided us with an opportunity to assess the relationships between early imaging observations and eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For a single cerebral slice, at the centre of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, a relationship between the area of reduced T2* at 1 and 2 h post MCAo correlated highly with final lesion area (Spearman rank correlation, r=0.98, P&lt;0.01, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes in the thromboembolic MCAo model were compared with a 120-min occlusion, 22-h reperfusion protocol using an intraluminal thread MCAo approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the thromboembolic model, the total lesion volume was found to be smaller (178.7+/-84.2 vs. 243.3+/-50.1 mm(3), mean+/-S.D., Student's t-test P=0.046) and showed a greater variability (coefficient of variations: 47% vs. 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data underline the relative variability of this embolic model and provide important preliminary information regarding the value of early changes in T2* in predicting eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
