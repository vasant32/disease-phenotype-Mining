<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perivascularly positioned cerebral mast cells (MC) have been shown to participate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blood-brain barrier disruption and expansive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following experimental transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because proteolytic gelatinase enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, are thought to have a central role in compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we examined whether cerebral MCs influence gelatinase activity in ischemic cerebral microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats underwent 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 3-hour reperfusion, and were treated with a MC-stabilizing (cromoglycate), or MC-degranulating (compound 48/80) agent, or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetically manipulated, MC-deficient WsRc(Ws/Ws) rats and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates (WT) underwent the same procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Cerebral edema</z:hpo> and extravasation of Evans blue albumin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gelatinase activity was visualized by in situ zymography and was quantified with computerized high-throughput image and data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activated MCs showed secretion of gelatinase-positive granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic MC deficiency decreased global gelatinase-active area (-69%, compared with WT; P&lt;0.001) and the mean gelatinase activity of the ischemic microvasculature (-57% compared with WT; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MC stabilization with cromoglycate decreased the percentage of microvessels with high gelatinase activity (-36% compared with saline; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compound 48/80 showed increased area of in situ zymography activity in the ischemic lesion (+55% compared with saline; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microvascular gelatinase activity correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> (r=0.84; P&lt;0.001; and r=0.61; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cerebral MCs participate in regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> microvascular gelatinase activation and consequent blood-brain barrier disruption following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
