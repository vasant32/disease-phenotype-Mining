<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between running, glial cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines was studied in the context of neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was investigated in four groups of rats, namely, (1) nonrunner, (2) runner after 12 weeks of treadmill running, (3) nonrunner with MCAO and (4) runner with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The horizontal diagonal band of Broca (HDB) in the septum was scrutinized for qualitative cum quantitative changes in the microglia and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot work were carried out in the forebrain homogenate to determine, respectively, the gene and protein expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the runner exhibited less immunoreactivity and reduced numbers of glial cells within the HDB compared with the nonrunner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and interferon-gamma, were significantly downregulated in the runner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest albeit with some inconsistency that the runner/MCAO rats had benefited from running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that running can result in changes to the microenvironment, in which the microglia and astrocytes exist in a state of quiescence concomitant with a reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that may lead to beneficial effects seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> induced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
