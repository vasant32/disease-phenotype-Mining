<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) have the potential to improve neurologic function when transplanted into animal models of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how the transplanted BMSC restore the lost neurologic function is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether BMSC express the neuron-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) receptor when transplanted into brain that has been subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The BMSC were harvested from green fluorescent protein-transgenic mice and were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BMSC or vehicle was transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum 7 d after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using autoradiography and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the binding of 125I-iomazenil and the expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> receptor protein in and around the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 4 wk after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Binding of 125I-iomazenil was significantly higher in the periinfarct neocortex in the BMSC-transplanted animals than in the vehicle-transplanted animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the number of the GABAA receptor-positive cells was significantly higher in the periinfarct neocortex in the BMSC-transplanted animals than in the vehicle-transplanted animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A certain subpopulation of the transplanted BMSC expressed a neuron-specific marker, microtubule-associated protein 2, and the marker protein specific for GABAA receptor in the periinfarct area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BMSC may contribute to neural tissue regeneration through migrating toward the periinfarct area and acquiring the neuron-specific receptor function </plain></SENT>
