<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 is used worldwide to treat many ailments, and although a number of studies have shown its neuroprotective properties, the mechanisms of action have not been elucidated fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that EGb 761 and some of its bioactive components [Bilobalide (BB), Ginkgolide A (GA), Ginkgolide B (GB), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35186">Terpene</z:chebi> Free Material (TFM)] could provide neuroprotection in ischemic conditions through <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) and survived for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HO1 knockout (HO1⁻/⁻) mice showed significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and Neurologic Deficit Scores (NDS) as compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> (WT) counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another cohort, WT mice subjected to pMCAO and treated at 4 h of pMCAO with 100 mg/kg EGb 761, 6 mg/kg BB, GA, GB, or 10 mg/kg TFM showed significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (BB; 29.0±3.9%, GA; 31.3±4.0%, GB; 32.0±3.8%, TFM; 32.5±3.5%, and EGb 761; 27.4±4.5%) than those in the vehicle-treated mice (46.0±3.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, NDS were lower in BB; 7.1±1.8, GA; 7.4±2.1, GB; 7.9±1.8, TFM; 7.7±1.7, and EGb 761; 6.8±2.0 groups as compared with the vehicle-treated group (13.8±1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the protective effect of EGb 761 was essentially lost when HO1 knockout mice were treated with EGb 761 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another cohort, HO1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) protein levels in the brain cortices appeared to be higher in EGb 761 and BB but not in GA, GB and TFM treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that HO1 plays, at least in part, an important role in the neuroprotective mechanism of EGb 761 and in delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeting this pathway could lead to neuroprotective agents against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
