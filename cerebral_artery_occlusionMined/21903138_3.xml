<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The management with thrombolytic therapy has to be initiated within 3-4 h and is associated with limitations like increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and progression of cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophilin inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and tacrolimus have been shown to afford neuroprotection by improving neurological functions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in rats by occluding the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using the intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 h of MCAo, animals were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (50, 150, 250 μg/kg, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of occlusion, reperfusion was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after reperfusion, animals were subjected to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAo, motor performance was assessed, the animals were euthanized and the brains were removed for estimation of malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> 150 and 250 μg/kg in percent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, apparent diffusion coefficient and signal intensity as compared to vehicle treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> treatment ameliorated motor impairment associated with MCAo and significantly reversed the changes in levels of malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study indicate neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in MCAo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
