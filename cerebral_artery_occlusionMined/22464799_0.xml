<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) is a frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with high relevance for outcome and survival, underlying pathomechanisms remain inadequately understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be because suitable animal models are largely lacking and existing models are poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male 129/SV mice were subjected to 30-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo)/reperfusion and serial magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of animals received selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> starting 7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral assessment was performed at 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify biological correlates of PSD, we quantified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> levels in serum and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was assessed using tyrosine hydroxylase and dynorphin in situ hybridizations as well as <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> transporter autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left, but not right, MCAo, elicited <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo> and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and despair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like syndrome was associated with alterations in the mesolimbic reward system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCAo resulted in delayed degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in ipsilateral midbrain, which was accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> concentrations and decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> transporter density along with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels in ischemic striatum and increased dynorphin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression in nucleus accumbens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> antidepressant treatment initiated as late as 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reversed the behavioral phenotype, prevented degeneration of dopaminergic midbrain neurons, and attenuated striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> at 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of the dopaminergic system for the development of PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> by antidepressants may provide a novel target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
