<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its function and alternation in brain injury have not yet been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of MSP after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ localization of MSP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> demonstrated a higher level in the corpus callosum and around the ischemic area from 12 h to 14 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> reperfusion, with the peak of expression coming 3 days after reperfusion in both regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the expression of protein was found 1 day after reperfusion in the same brain region that was observed for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak was 7 days after reperfusion in both regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Micro-autoradiography, immunostaining and double immunohistochemical labeling revealed the expression of MSP to be located mainly in the oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that MSP may be related to the turnover of the myelin-associated proteins and the extracellular matrix proteins after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of MSP may play a role in remodeling processes such as neurite outgrowth and remyelination </plain></SENT>
