<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, a proteomic analysis was used to identify the effects of focal CI on synaptosomal protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contralateral and ipsilateral synaptosomes, prepared from adult mice subjected to 60 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, were isolated following 3, 6 and 20 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synaptosomal protein samples (n=3) were labeled using the cleavable ICAT system prior to analysis with nanoLC-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each sample was analyzed by LC-MS to identify differential expressions using InDEPT software and differentially expressed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were identified by targeted LC-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 62 differentially expressed proteins were identified and Gene Ontology classification (cellular component) indicated that the majority of the proteins were located in the mitochondria and other components consistent with synaptic localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed alterations in synaptic protein levels poorly correlated with gene expression, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in determining post-ischemic synaptic protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, immunohistochemistry analysis of prosaposin (Psap) and saposin C (SapC) indicates that CI disrupts Psap processing and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the synapse is adversely affected by CI and may play a role in mediating post-ischemic neuronal viability </plain></SENT>
