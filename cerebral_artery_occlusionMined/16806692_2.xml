<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown the close relationship of NCX and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But controversial results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three NCX isoforms, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 were distributed selectively in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, which suggests that each isoform may have different function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the time-related alteration of gene and protein expressions of NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 in rat brain cortex after 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to investigate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of each NCX isoform at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot was used to measure the protein expressions of each NCX isoform at 2, 12, and 24 h of reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NCX1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was reduced by 42.1% and 27.8%, respectively, at 2 and 6h of reperfusion and restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 12 and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NCX1 protein was decreased by 36.6% at 2 h of reperfusion and recovered at 12 and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of NCX2 and NCX3 did not change significantly over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NCX1 might play an important role in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
