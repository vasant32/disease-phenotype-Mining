<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work aimed to define the spatial expression of endothelin A (ET(A)) and B (ET(B)) receptors in the cerebral cortex after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and to identify the phenotype of cells expressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical expression of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors was determined at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining, 12, 24 and 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing endothelin receptors were phenotyped by double labelling with antibodies, anti-protein gene product (PGP9.5) and anti-ED1, towards neurons and activated microglia/macrophages, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both ET(A) and ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions increased significantly in the ipsilateral cortex in a time-dependent manner after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Robust expression of ET(A) receptors was noted in most neurons of the ischemic core and in several neurons in laminae 3 and 4 of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region 24 and 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET(B) receptor immunoreactivity was observed in activated microglia/macrophages, beginning 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first evidence that the action of endothelin during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be mediated by neuronal ET(A) receptors and activated microglia/macrophage ET(B) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This differential localization of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors suggests that endothelin is involved in some complex neuron-glial interactions in addition to its vascular modulatory activity during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
