<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 60 days after unilateral transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 30 min, the operated rats exhibited the ipsiversive rotational behavior elicited by systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51065">dopamine receptor agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48538">apomorphine</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the ipsilateral striatum of the rats showed a subdivisional ischemic injury, while the nigral dopaminergic neurons appeared intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The striatal lesions having a cell type-specific injury were located in the dorsolateral portion of the rostral striatum and in the lateral portion of the caudal part of the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could successfully produce selective damage of a striatal subdivision, which causes an abnormality in motor controls in response to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present data may provide a part of functional and anatomical basis for understanding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> associated with basal ganglia dysfunction (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>), which may occur in patients with cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
