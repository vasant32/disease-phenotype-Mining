<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if post-ischemic treatment with the 21-aminosteroid <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation inhibitor tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F) could affect reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> during the first 3h following a 3h period of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult female cynomolgus monkeys (N = 14) were subjected under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia to a 3h period of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 3h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U-74006F, 3.0 mg/kg i.v. or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> vehicle, was administered 10 min before beginning reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple spin-echo (8 echoes: TE = 26.3 msec; TR = 3.0 secs; 2.35 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging was performed every 30 min, beginning at 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transverse relaxation rates (T2) for the caudate, putamen, cortex, insular cortex, parietal cortex and central white matter were calculated as an index of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the final images, corresponding regions were removed for determination of water content by the wet weight/dry weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The T2 measurements strongly suggested the presence of post-reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gray matter, but not white matter, regions at 1h after reperfusion in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> development was seen in the putamen and insular cortex in U-74006F-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An effect was also observed in the parietal cortex, but none in the caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The measurement of water content at 3h after reperfusion yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results showing the ability of U-74006F to attenuate post-reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> support the concept that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation is a significant mediator of reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic window for U-74006F's anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> effect appears to be at least 3h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> since delaying treatment until just before reperfusion largely prevented subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in cortical regions and the putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effects of U-74006F on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> may play a mechanistic role in the compound's reported neuroprotective efficacy in a variety of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
