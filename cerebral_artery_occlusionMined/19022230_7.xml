<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchanger-1 (NHE-1) inhibitor KR-33028 on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity in cultured neuron cells in vitro and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in vivo by comparing its potency with that of zoniporide, a well-known, highly potent NHE-1 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KR-33028 inhibited NHE-1 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=2.2 nM), with 18-fold greater potency than that of zoniporide (IC(50)=40.7 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KR-33028 significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced LDH release with approximately 100 times lower EC(25) than that of zoniporide in cortical neurons in vitro (EC(25) of 0.007 and 0.81 microM, respectively), suggesting its 100-fold greater potency than zoniporide in producing anti-necrotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EC(50) of KR-33028 for anti-apoptotic effect was 100 times lower than that of zoniporide shown by TUNEL positivity (0.005 and 0.62 microM, respectively) and caspase-3 activity (0.01 and 2.64 microM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the EC(50) value of KR-33028 against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced intracellular Ca(2+) overload was also 100 times lower than that of zoniporide (EC(50) of 0.004 and 0.65 microM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model (60 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h reperfusion), KR-33028 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its ED(25) value, however, was quite similar to that of zoniporide (ED(25) of 0.072 and 0.097 mg/kg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence these results suggest that the novel NHE-1 inhibitor, KR-33028, could be an efficient therapeutic tool to protect neuronal cells against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
