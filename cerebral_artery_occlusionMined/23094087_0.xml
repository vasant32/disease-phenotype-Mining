<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that massive global SUMOylation occurs during hibernation <z:mp ids='MP_0005202'>torpor</z:mp> in ground squirrels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that overexpression of Ubc9, SUMO-1, or SUMO-2/3 provides protection against ischemic damage in cell lines and cortical neurons exposed to oxygen/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, and in mice exposed to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now extended our study to other Ubiquitin-Like-Modifiers (ULMs), which have multiple cellular functions during stress, in order to assess the possibility that they also have roles in tolerance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that not only SUMO conjugation, but also global protein conjugation by other ULMs including NEDD8, ISG15, UFM1 and FUB1 were significantly increased in the brains of hibernating ground squirrels during <z:mp ids='MP_0005202'>torpor</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of miRNA microarrays of ground squirrel brain samples (from active and <z:mp ids='MP_0005202'>torpor</z:mp> phase) we found that the miR-200 family (miR-200a,b,c/miR-141/miR-429) and the miR-182 family (miR-182/miR-183/miR-96) were among the most consistently depressed miRNAs in the brain during the <z:mp ids='MP_0005202'>torpor</z:mp> phase as compared to active animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that these miRNAs are involved in the expression of various ULM proteins and their global conjugation to proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that inhibition of the miR-200 family and/or miR-182 family miRNA activities in SHSY5Y cells increases global protein conjugation by the above ULMs and makes these cells more tolerant to OGD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to describe that the natural tolerance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in hibernators is linked to regulation by microRNAs of a broad range of ubiquitin-like modifiers </plain></SENT>
