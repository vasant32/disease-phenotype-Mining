<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After placebo or trandolapril was administered orally for 7 days, we infarcted in the territory of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> by extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and studied the effect of trandolapril on brain ACE activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In placebo-treated rats, brain ACE activity in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side was increased by a significant 1.34-fold compared with that in the non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain ACE activities in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sides were suppressed to 39.8% by trandolapril treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratios of unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to the total coronal sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 48.1 +/- 3.3% and 37.4 +/- 2.3%, respectively, and the difference between these values was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that inhibition of the increased brain ACE activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions can reduce the infarction area after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
