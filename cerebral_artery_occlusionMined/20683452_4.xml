<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the association of Aβ deposits, with the secondary thalamic damage after focal cortical infarction in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and then randomly divided into MCAO, vehicle, and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32433">L-alanyl</z:chebi>]-S-phenylglycine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">t-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (DAPT) groups and 12 sham-operated rats as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DAPT was administered orally at 72 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after MCAO, sensory function, neuron loss, and glial activation and proliferation were evaluated using adhesive removal test, Nissl staining, and immunostaining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thalamic Aβ accumulation was evaluated using immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle group, the ipsilateral thalamic Aβ, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, glial activation and proliferation, and the mean time to remove the stimulus from right forepaw significantly decreased in DAPT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time to remove the stimulus from the right forepaw and thalamic Aβ burden were both negatively correlated with the number of thalamic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Aβ deposits are associated with the secondary thalamic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction of thalamic Aβ by γ-secretase inhibitor may attenuate the secondary damage and improve sensory function after cerebral cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
