<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) with major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after the approval of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) but before approval of the MERCI retriever </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively enrolled 1170 consecutive patients with AIS and major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (496 women; mean age, 73.9 ± 12.3 years) who were admitted within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to 12 Japanese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers between October 2005 and June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolism was a leading cause of AIS in this group (68.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occlusion sites of the major cerebral arteries included the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery (ICA; 29.6%), middle cerebral artery (52.2%), and basilar artery (7.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization therapy (RT) was performed in 32.0% of patients (IV rt-PA, 20.0%; neuroendovascular therapy, 9.4%; combined, 2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> within 36 hours with a ≥1-point increase in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score occurred in 5.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months (or at hospital discharge), 29.3% of the patients had a favorable outcome (based on a modified Rankin scale score of 0-2), 23.8% were bedridden, and 15.6% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, RT was positively associated with a favorable outcome and negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whereas age, baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, and ICA occlusion were negatively associated with a favorable outcome and positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-third of the patients with AIS and major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with RT, which was independently associated with favorable outcomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 40% of the patients became bedridden or died during the post-alteplase, pre-MERCI era in Japan </plain></SENT>
