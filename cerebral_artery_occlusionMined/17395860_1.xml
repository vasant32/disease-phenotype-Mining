<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A prominent feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is the excessive intracellular accumulation of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and Ca(2+) ions, which results in subsequent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), regulates the distribution of these ions acting either in the forward mode or in its reverse mode and it can play a critical role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether the activity of NCX leads to detrimental or beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Extracellular field potentials and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from rat corticostriatal brain-slice preparations in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area 24 hours after the permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced in rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">Bepridil</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of NCX, reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=68 micromol/L) the field potential amplitude recorded from the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of corticostriatal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no change was observed in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> was mimicked by 5-(N-4-chlorobenzyl)-2',4'-dimethylbenzamil (CB-DMB) (IC(50)=6 micromol/L), a more selective inhibitor of NCX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In whole-cell patch clamp experiments, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> and CB-DMB caused an inward current in spiny neurons recorded from the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area but not in the same cells recorded from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, cholinergic interneurons recorded from the striatal peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area did not develop an inward current after the application of NCX inhibitors, suggesting that the electrophysiological alterations induced by NCX inhibition are cell-type specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">Bepridil</z:chebi> and CB-DMB also induced a suppression of excitatory synaptic currents in most of spiny neurons recorded from the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was not coupled to a significant change of paired-pulse facilitation suggesting a postsynaptic site of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that NCX plays a critical role in the maintenance of ionic homeostasis in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
