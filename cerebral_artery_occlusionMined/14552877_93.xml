<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, their differentiation into neuron-like cells expressing markers typical for mature neurons has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We isolated human adipose tissue stromal cells (hATSCs) from human liposuction tissues and induced neural differentiation with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following neural induction, hATSCs changed toward neural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and displayed expression of MAP2 and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hATSCs, which were labeled with LacZ adenovirus, were injected into the lateral ventricle of the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transplanted cells migrated to various parts of the brain, and ischemic brain injury by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) increased their migration to the injured cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the transplanted cells expressed MAP2 and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of hATSCs improved functional deficits in ischemic brain injury induced by MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral grafting of BDNF-transduced hATSCs significantly improved motor recovery of functional deficits in MCAo rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that transplanted hATSCs survive, migrate, and improve functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that genetically engineered hATSCs can express biologically active gene products and, therefore, can function as effective vehicles for therapeutic gene transfer to the brain </plain></SENT>
