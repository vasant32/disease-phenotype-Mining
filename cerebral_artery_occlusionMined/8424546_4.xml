<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> on distribution of cerebral blood flow during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is controversial, this investigation was performed in rats to determine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, instituted immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, produces a favorable redistribution of blood flow (an "inverse steal") toward the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After surgical preparation during normocapnic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomized to either immediate institution of <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> (n = 9; PaCO2 23 +/- 2 mmHg) or continued normocapnia (n = 8; PaCO2 40 +/- 2 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes thereafter, local cerebral blood flow (1-CBF) was determined autoradiographically using <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was determined in four coronal brain sections spanning the distribution of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAO, the areas of cortex in which CBF fell within three specified CBF ranges (0-6, 6-15, and 15-23 ml/100 g/min) were measured and expressed as a percentage of the total area of cortex in that section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the hemisphere contralateral to MCAO, to confirm the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity in non-ischemic brain in this model, average 1-CBF was determined for the cortex, the subcortex, and the entire hemisphere in each coronal section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>Hypocapnia</z:mp> resulted in significantly lower 1-CBF in the cortex, subcortex, and entire hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coronal sections of brain contralateral to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAO, a favorable redistribution of CBF was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the three more anterior coronal sections (1-3), a significantly larger percentage of the cortex had 1-CBF in the range of 15-23 ml x 100 g-1 x min-1 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> group animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In sections 2 and 3, significantly larger areas of cortex had 1-CBF in the range of 6-15 ml x 100 g-1 x min-1 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> group than in the normocapnia group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections, there were no significant differences between hypocapnic and normocapnic groups in the area of cortex with 1-CBF in the range of 0-6 ml x 100 g-1 x min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study does not provide evidence for the occurrence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>-induced inverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of 30 min duration in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that, rather than reducing the area of the critically ischemic brain, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> may increase the size of the region at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The data do not support the use of <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> as a therapeutic measure to produce a favorable redistribution of CBF during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
