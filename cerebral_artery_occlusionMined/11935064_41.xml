<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study whether intravascular or hemodynamic factors contribute to the marked neuroprotective effect of albumin therapy in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, 2 complementary methods were applied: laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and laser-Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the LSCM study, Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, and a cranial window was placed over the dorsolateral frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by an intraluminal suture and were treated with human albumin (1.25 g/kg; n=4) or saline (n=3) after 30 minutes of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Video images of cortical vessels were continually acquired and were digitized offline to measure diameters and fluorescent erythrocyte velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the LDPI study, cortical perfusion was measured in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats that received 2-hour MCAO and were treated with albumin (2.5 g/kg; n=6) or saline (n=5) at 30 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the LSCM study, MCAO was associated with arteriolar dilation and slowing of capillary and venular erythrocyte perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first 15 to 30 minutes of postischemic recirculation, prominent foci of vascular stagnation developed within cortical venules, associated with thrombuslike foci and adherent corpuscular structures consistent in size with neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Saline administration failed to affect these phenomena, while albumin therapy was followed by significant increases in arteriolar diameter ( approximately 12%; P=0.007) and by a prompt improvement of venular and capillary erythrocyte perfusion and a partial disappearance of adherent thrombotic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Albumin therapy increased erythrocyte flow velocity in both capillaries (288+/-73% versus 76+/-18% in the saline group; P=0.023) and venules (2.7-fold [P=0.001] versus 1.0-fold in the saline group [P=NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the LDPI study, cortical perfusion declined during MCAO and rose initially with recirculation (to approximately 135% of baseline) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean cortical perfusion improved slightly (approximately 14%; P=NS) in albumin-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal a beneficial effect of albumin therapy in reversing stagnation, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and corpuscular adherence within cortical venules in the reperfusion phase after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and support its utility in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
