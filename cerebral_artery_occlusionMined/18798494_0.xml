<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuroprotective action of vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VIP was given via intracerebroventriclar injection after a 2 hour transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was investigated with TTC stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic boundary zone were evaluated with TUNEL stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting were used to analyze the iNOS protein expression as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After VIP injection, the relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of rats was significantly reduced by approximately 28% campared to that of the control groups at 1 day (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL positive cells was significantly decreased in the ischemic boundary zone, and then the expression of iNOS was remarkablely decreased as well (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VIP has a neuroprotective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism seems to involve decreasing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and down-regulating the iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
