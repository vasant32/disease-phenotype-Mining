<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings have highlighted the neuroprotective effects of leptin against ischemic brain injury; however, to date, little is known about the role performed by the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, a major mediator of leptin receptor transduction pathway in the brain, in the beneficial effects of the hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of leptin produces neuroprotection in rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), as revealed by a significant reduction of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit up to 7 days after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By combining a subcellular fractionation approach with immunohistofluorescence, we observe that neuroprotection is associated with a cell type-specific modulation of STAT3 phosphorylation in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early enhancement of nuclear phospho-STAT3 induced by leptin in the astrocytes of the ischemic penumbra may contribute to a beneficial effect of these cells on the evolution of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the elevation of phospho-STAT3 induced by leptin in the neurons after 24â€‰h MCAo is associated with an increased expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 in the cortex, suggesting its possible involvement to the neuroprotection produced by the adipokine </plain></SENT>
