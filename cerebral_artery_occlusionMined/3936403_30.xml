<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In untreated control animals there were profound localized reductions in 1CBF 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were most pronounced in neocortical areas and in the caudate nucleus ipsilateral to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animals pretreated with nimodipine (1 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 for 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion), the ipsilateral decrease in 1CBF in cortical regions was significantly less than that in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug did not appear to alter 1CBF in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological quantification of the ischemic damage present 3 hours after occlusion showed that nimodipine pretreatment reduced the volume and extent of cellular damage in the periphery but not in the core of the lesion </plain></SENT>
