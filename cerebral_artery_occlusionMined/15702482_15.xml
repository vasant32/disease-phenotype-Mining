<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In cerebral ischemic insults, activated inflammatory cells such as microglia and macrophages may be implicated in the pattern and degree of ischemic injury by producing various bioactive mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we provide the evidence that activated microglia/macrophages accelerate cerebral ischemic injury by overexpression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To activate microglia/macrophages, a potent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> inducer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS, 5 microg/5 microl) was microinjected into rat corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolectin B4-positive microglia/macrophages were abundantly observed in ipsilateral hemisphere at 1 day after LPS injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR showed that LPS injection induced iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression mostly in microglia/macrophages, peaking in intensity at 15 h after LPS injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While ischemic injury was little evoked in control rats by 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 3-h reperfusion, it was markedly increased in rats pre-injected with LPS 1 day before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference between control and LPS-pretreated groups was observed after 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased ischemic injury in LPS-treated rats was well correlated with iNOS level expressed over 3 orders of magnitude than in LPS-untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that iNOS- and nitrotyrosine (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> marker)-positive cells were prominent throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NOS inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> or N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, simultaneously injected with LPS, reduced the iNOS immunoreactivity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, especially in penumbra regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels in ischemic regions were decreased more in LPS pre-injected rats than in control ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further defining the role of NO in cerebral ischemic insults would provide the rationale for new therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microglial and macrophageal NO production in the brain </plain></SENT>
