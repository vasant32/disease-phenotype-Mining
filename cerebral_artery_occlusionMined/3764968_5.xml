<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50512">lidocaine hydrochloride</z:chebi> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infusion was begun half an hour prior to clip occlusion and the rate was adjusted to maintain an isoelectric EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine cats served as controls, receiving an equivalent volume of 5% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> 0.2% saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen animals (7 lidocaine-treated and 6 control) were sacrificed after six hours of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining seven cats, the vessel was occluded for four hours prior to sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neuronal alteration was assessed by both histochemical (2'3'5' triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> reaction) and histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With both durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there was no significant difference in the extent and severity of neuronal alterations between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated and control groups of animals </plain></SENT>
