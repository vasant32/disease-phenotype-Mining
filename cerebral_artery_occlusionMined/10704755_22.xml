<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the preponderant use of male animals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research may produce results not applicable to female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients due to gender-related differences, we examined whether delayed NAm treatment could protect female rats against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NAm (500 mg/kg) given intravenously, 2 h after MCAo, significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of female Sprague-Dawley (55%, P&lt;0.05) and Wistar rats (60%, P&lt;0.05) rats when compared with saline-injected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies confirm that NAm is neuroprotective specifically at the dose of 500 mg/kg in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The novel findings are that this neuroprotection occurs in female, as well as male rats, and that the neuroprotection observed is more robust when administered as an intravenous bolus compared with intraperitoneal administration </plain></SENT>
