<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of HBO on ischemic striatal metabolites at different times after MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rat MCAO model was produced via the intraluminal filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of occlusion the suture was removed and reperfusion was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBO treatment was administered by putting rats in the HBO chamber at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) HBO for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in striatal extracellular fluid were collected and measured by a microdialysis system at 7, 10, and 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that altered brain energy metabolites and excitatory amino acids occurred during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and and HBO regulated these striatal metabolites, which might contribute to the protective effect of HBO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
