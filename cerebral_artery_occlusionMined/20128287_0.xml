<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety Wistar rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, sham-operation (sham), model, EA acupoint and EA non-acupoint groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI-RI model was established by using modified middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These rats were further divided into 1 day (d), 3 d and 7 d subgroups, with 6 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EA (1 mA, 2 Hz/30 Hz) was applied to acupoint "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Quchi" (LI 11), and non-acupoints (5 mm lateral to ST 36 and 5 mm apart from LI 11 on the radial side respectively) for 30 min, once daily for 1 d, 3 d and 7 d separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum cortisole (CORT) content was assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the expression of hypothalamic adrenocorticotropic releasing factor (CRF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (GR) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham groups, serum CORT levels of model and EA non-acupoint groups on the 1st, 3rd and 7th day increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), while compared with model groups, serum CORT level of EA acupoint groups decreased apparently (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham groups, hypothalamic CRF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and pituitary ACTH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of model groups were upregulated significantly on the 1st, 3rd and 7th d after CI-RI (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05), and hypothalamic GR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of model groups were obviously downregulated (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with model groups, hypothalamic CRF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and pituitary ACTH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of EA acupoint groups at the 3 time-points, and their expression of EA non-acupoint groups on the 1st and 3rd day were remarkably downregulated (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05), and hypothalamic GR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of EA acupoint groups was upregulated significantly at the 3 time-points (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison between EA acupoint and EA non-acupoint groups showed that the effect of EA acupoint groups was obviously superior to that of EA non-acupoint groups in downregulating CRF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and ACTH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and in upregulating GR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression at the 3 time-points (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of meridian-acupoints can effectively downregulate serum CORT content, hypothalamic CRF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and pituitary ACTH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and upregulate hypothalamic GR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in CI-RI rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving CI-RI </plain></SENT>
