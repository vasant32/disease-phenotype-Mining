<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether misery perfusion (MP) commonly accompanies brain borderzones (BZs) in patients with major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We elucidated topographic patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic failure in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with unilateral occlusion or severe stenosis (&gt;75% in diameter) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral arterial (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) trunk with minimal or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> underwent PET with (15)O-labeled gas inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and CBV/CBF ratio were determined in the superficial BZs, internal BZ, and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory excluding BZs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values in BZs were standardized and compared with those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topographic distributions of regions with OEF greater than that in controls were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Values in patients and controls were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topographic distributions included matched perfusion in 10 patients, MP in only the ipsilateral internal BZ in four, MP in both ipsilateral internal and superficial BZs in two, MP in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory including BZs in one, MP in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory including BZs and contralateral BZs in two, and MP in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories including BZs in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only 25% of the patients had MP localized in affected BZs Although localized MP more frequently accompanied the internal BZ than other regions, no patient had elevated OEF in the superficial BZ alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are inconsistent with clinical observations that 80% of BZ infarctions develop superficially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, hemodynamic mechanisms may not cause most superficial BZ infarctions </plain></SENT>
