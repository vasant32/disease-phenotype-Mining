<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have demonstrated the effects of breviscapine on neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered with breviscapine (50 or 100 mg kg(-1)/day) intragastrically for seven successive days, then subjected to 2-h brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, the rats were killed and the brain samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining was used to evaluate the histopathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotiny-lated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis were used to detect the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of bcl-2 and caspase-3 in the cortex were determined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in the number of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin- and TUNEL-positive staining cells and DNA fragmentation were observed at 24 h after reperfusion, and the increases were inhibited by breviscapine (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breviscapine at both doses markedly inhibited the expression and activation of caspase-3 and up-regulated the expression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that breviscapine attenuated neuroapoptosis and regulated the protein expression related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, which may have contributed, in part, to the protective effects of breviscapine on cerebral ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
