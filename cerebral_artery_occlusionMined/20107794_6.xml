<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method to excite neurons in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism of its therapeutic effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of high-frequency rTMS in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917805,C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient cerebral ischaemia</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (n=30) were anaesthetized with chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> and subjected to 90 min of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with subsequent reperfusion in three groups: control (n=10), rTMS (n=10), or sham-rTMS groups (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the rTMS group, rTMS was given 1 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and every 24 h for 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, small-animal PET (microPET) imaging with (18)F-FDG was used to evaluate brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic molecules were measured in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> margin using immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological scores of the rats in the rTMS group were higher than in those of the control group over the whole 7-day observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total, cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly less in the rTMS group than in the control group, as measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG microPET images showed significantly higher standardized uptake values in the cortex and striatum in the rTMS group than in the control group in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of cells positive for caspase-3 was significantly lower in the rTMS group than in the control group, while the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly higher in the rTMS group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rTMS therapy increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischaemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG PET could be used to monitor rTMS therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917805,C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in animal studies and in future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
