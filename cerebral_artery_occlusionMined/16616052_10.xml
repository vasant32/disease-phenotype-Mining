<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NRG-1(3.0 ng/kg) was applied intravascularly 10 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and then focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 90 min and reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were scored post-reperfusion for neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the brain was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>(TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated by TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure changes of caspase-3 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of TNF-alpha was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that recombinant human NRG-1 could reduce cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by about 71% (P &lt; 0.05) and TUNEL positive cells when given immediately before MCAO, and improved behavior of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also showed that NRG-1 could also decrease the expression of caspase-3 mRNA and production of TNF-alpha protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that pre-administration of NRG-1 attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This protective effect may be involved in the inhibition of caspase-3 and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
