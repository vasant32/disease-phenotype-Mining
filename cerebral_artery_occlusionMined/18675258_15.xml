<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been being widely worked out recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a cell therapy agent in the therapy of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were carried out in inbred male Wistar-Kyoto rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow, expanded in culture and labelled with vital <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> PKH-26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then 5 x 10(6) cells were injected into the tail vein on the day of MCAO and three days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control group animals received PBS injection (negative control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function restoration was estimated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water Maze</z:mp> testing during 6 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 5 days and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravenous MSC transplantation decreased post-operation mortality and benefited behavioural and neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Experimental groups animals revealed changes in aseptic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> processes which were completed faster comparing to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>That effect correlated with accelerated glial scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and such post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after-effects as border zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and liquor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> formation accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> and subventricular zone cells proliferation were shown after cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The obtained results referred to both cell therapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, MSC injection benefited post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation irrespective of transplantation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, further investigation should be carried out in order to find out the mechanism of their action </plain></SENT>
