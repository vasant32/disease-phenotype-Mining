<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced in mice after 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Culture of SH-SY5Y human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells with 100 Î¼M <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> for 24h was used as an in vitro neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 30- and 100-fold concentrated murine ASC-CM 1h prior to MCAO resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of murine ASC-CM immediately after MCAO was also effective, but administration 2h after MCAO was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of murine ASC-CM were also confirmed in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 100-fold concentrated murine ASC-CM at 10% of the total culture volume significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar reduction in the MCAO-induced infarction volume was seen following i.c.v. administration of 100-fold concentrated human ASC-CM or murine ASC-CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ASC-CM appears to exert ameliorative effects on experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> i\n both in vivo and in vitro models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the feasibility of ASC-CM administration as a therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
