<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SolCD39 is a soluble form of recombinant human ecto-ATP/ADPase (NTPDase1) and represents a new class of antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SolCD39 blocks and reverses platelet activation, preventing recruitment of additional platelets into a growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of solCD39 on neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physiologically controlled Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 2-hour MCAO by retrograde insertion of an intraluminal suture coated with poly-l-lysine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The agent (solCD39) was administered intravenously before MCAO or at 1-hour or 3-hour recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other groups received vehicle (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>-buffered saline) or human albumin (as a "positive" neuroprotective control; 25%, 0.5% of body weight) at 1-hour recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated during occlusion (at 60 minutes) and daily for 3 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were perfusion-fixed at 72 hours, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with solCD39 significantly improved the neurological score at 72 hours compared with the vehicle group (4.4+/-0.6 versus 7.6+/-0.6, respectively; P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were significantly reduced at multiple levels by pretreatment with solCD39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was also significantly reduced compared with vehicle by both solCD39 pretreatment (48% mean reduction) and solCD39 treatment at 3-hour recirculation (51% mean reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SolCD39 significantly reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (corrected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>) by an average of 71% to 72% when administered either before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or at 3 hours of recirculation compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with albumin significantly reduced neurological score and total, cortical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> at multiple levels, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with SolCD39, administered either before or at 3 hours after MCAO, improves neurological score and reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A pharmacological agent of this type appears to have potential for the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
