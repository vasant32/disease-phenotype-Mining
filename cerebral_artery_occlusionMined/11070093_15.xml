<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between PS1 and excitotoxicity in four different experimental models of neurotoxicity by using primary neurons from (i) transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing a human <z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>-linked PS1 variant (L286V mutation), (ii) tg mice overexpressing human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) PS1, (iii) PS1 knockout mice, and (iv) wt mice in which PS1 gene expression was knocked down by antisense treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that primary neurons overexpressing mutated PS1 showed an increased vulnerability to both excitotoxic and hypoxic-hypoglycemic damage when compared with neurons obtained from either mice overexpressing human wt PS1 or in wt mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, reduced excitotoxic damage was obtained in neurons in which PS1 expression was absent or diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data obtained in in vivo experimental models of excitotoxicity partially supported the in vitro observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accelerated neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was demonstrated in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing mutated PS1 after peripheral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> in comparison with wt animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, measurement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not show significant difference between the two animal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results altogether suggest that expression of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>-linked PS1 variants increases the vulnerability of neurons to a specific type of damage in which excitotoxicity plays a relevant role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, they support the view that reduction of endogenous PS1 expression results in neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
