<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are strong neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their potentials in neurogenesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, synaptogenesis, and antifibrosis have not been compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated these effects of HGF and GDNF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were subjected to 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion, HGF or GDNF was given by topical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BrdU was injected intraperitoneally twice daily 1, 2, and 3 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On 14 day, we histologically evaluated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, antiapoptotic effect, neurogenesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, synaptogenesis, and antifibrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both HGF and GDNF significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the number of TUNEL-positive cells, but only HGF significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the subventricular zone, and 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine -positive cells differentiated into mature neurons on the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and synaptogenesis at the ischemic boundary zone was also observed only in HGF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HGF significantly decreased the glial scar formation and scar thickness of the brain pia mater after tMCAO, but GDNF did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that both HGF and GDNF had significant neurotrophic effects, but only HGF can promote the neurogenesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and synaptogenesis and inhibit fibrotic change in brains after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
