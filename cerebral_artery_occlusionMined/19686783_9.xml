<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that exercise can up-regulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, thus enhancing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release through the synaptic-associated protein synapsin I in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treadmill training on the release of these factors in the striatum and on the motor function in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and brain-ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and brain-ischemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those in the brain-ischemic group underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the rats in each group underwent treadmill training for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rest remained relatively inactive for 14 days and served as the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Motor function was assessed by performing three motor tests (foot-fault-placing, parallel-bar-crossing, and ladder-climbing tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that after treadmill training, motor function improved significantly in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and brain-ischemic rats when compared with the corresponding controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, BDNF, and p-synapsin I were also up-regulated by treadmill training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the overall responses to treadmill training were similar in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and brain-ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of treadmill training might be partly due to the involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in neuronal activity in both brain-ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
