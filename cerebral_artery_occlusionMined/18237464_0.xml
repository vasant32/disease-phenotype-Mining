<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The plasma pharmacokinetics and brain uptake of the novel neuroprotective agent AM-36 (1-(2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxy)ethyl-4-(3,5-bis-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">1,1dimethylethyl</z:chebi>)-4-hydroxyphenyl) methylpiperazine) were assessed over 72 h following i.v. administration to male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At nominal i.v. doses of 0.2, 1 and 3mg kg(-1), AM-36 exhibited an extremely large volume of distribution (18.2-24.6 L kg(-1)) and a long terminal elimination half-life, ranging from 25.2 to 37.7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over this dose range, AM-36 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with no apparent change in clearance, volume of distribution or dose-normalised area under the plasma concentration - time curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AM-36 was very highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99.6%); however, this did not appear to affect the ability of AM-36 to permeate the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a single i.v. dose of AM-36 at 3mg kg(-1) to rats, brain concentrations were detected for up to 72 h, and the brain-to-plasma ratios were high at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (ranging from 8.2 at 5 min post-dose to 0.9 at 72 h post-dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The very high brain uptake of AM-36 supports previous in-vivo efficacy studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of this compound when administered to rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
