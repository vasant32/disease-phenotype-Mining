<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Change in expression of immunoreactive P-selectin was examined in rat brain after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) in comparison to that of permanent occlusion with an anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses were performed to ensure the selective detection of immunoreactive P-selectin protein with the monoclonal antibody using brain homogenates before and after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporal, spacial, and cellular changes of P-selectin expressions were evaluated with rat brain sections at 2, 8h, 1 and 3 days of permanent MCAO, and at 2, 8h, 1, 3 and 7 days of reperfusion after 1 h of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot showed a single band with a molecular weight of 140 kDa for both cases with permanent occlusion and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P-selectin immunoreactivity was not normally present in rat brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it was expressed mainly in the post-capillary venules of the cerebral cortex and caudate in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory with a peak at 2-8h after permanent occlusion and at 8h to 1 day after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression was diminished by 1 day of permanent occlusion and 3 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum staining in the case of permanent MCAO was stronger than the case with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, spacial distribution of the staining was similar in the cerebral cortex and caudate between the cases with permanent of transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a different temporal but similar spacial and cellular expression of P-selection immunoreactivity between permanent occlusion and reperfusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in rat brain </plain></SENT>
