<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether ventriculosubarachnoid perfusion of the brain with an oxygen-carrying nutrient emulsion affects the volume of infarction in animals with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An animal laboratory in a university setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight closed colony adult cats weighing between 3.5 and 4.5 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Cats were assigned randomly into one of three groups: untreated surgical controls, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) perfused, or oxygenated fluorochemical (t-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38810">bis perfluorobutylethylene</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38810">F44E</z:chebi>) nutrient emulsion (OFNE) perfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The formulation used in this study was developed for clinical use and is currently being used in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanently clipping the middle cerebral artery via the retro-orbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 90 mins postocclusion and continued for 18 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 1 hr after the termination of perfusion, the brains were sectioned and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was determined with a computer digitizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was a significant difference in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the OFNE-perfused animals compared with the other groups ( p&lt;or=.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was significantly reduced in the OFNE-perfused group relative to the surgical control group at 18 hrs ( P&lt;or=.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume correlated with intracranial pressure measured at the end of the treatment period (Spearman rank order, p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorochemical emulsion delivery of oxygen and nutrients directly to the brain by means of ventriculocisternal perfusion is a viable treatment alternative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, this technique may control elevations in intracranial pressure following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
