<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate whether the neuroprotective action of DPI extends to averting the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPI-induced gene changes were analyzed by microarray analysis from rat brains subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), or DMSO and DPI (DPI), and reperfused for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic expression profile was compared between groups using ingenuity pathway analysis at the pathway and network level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPI selectively up-regulated 23 genes and down-regulated 75 genes more than twofold compared with both DMSO and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It significantly suppressed inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase signaling and increased the expression of methionine adenosyltransferasesynthetase 2A and adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 genes, which are involved in increasing the production of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significantly affected gene network comprised genes implicated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> with an expression change indicating an overall suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both integrin- and interleukin-17A-signaling pathways were also significantly associated and suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the neuroprotective effects of DPI are mediated not only by suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-triggered <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> but also by limiting leukocyte migration and infiltration </plain></SENT>
