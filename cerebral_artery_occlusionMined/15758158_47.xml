<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether CD36 contributes to the brain damage produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and in mice deficient in CD36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, CD36 protein expression was increased in the ischemic brain, such that it was located predominantly in cells expressing the microglia/macrophage marker CD11b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 49% smaller in CD36-null mice than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls, an effect associated with improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The attenuation in brain injury in CD36 nulls could not be attributed to differences in cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was markedly attenuated in CD36-null mice in the early stage after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data unveil a previously unrecognized role of CD36 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced ROS production and brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modulation of CD36 signaling may provide a new strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
