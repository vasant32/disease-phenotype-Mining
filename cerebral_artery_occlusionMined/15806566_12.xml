<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of extracellular matrix components, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi>, after brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is known to accompany the glial reaction, forming repellent scars that hinder axonal growth and the reorganization of the injured neuronal networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix associated with perineuronal nets (PNs) in the primarily injured and remote regions has not yet been systematically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We use the model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-lasting consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for PNs, related to the damage of neurons and reactions of glial cells, in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular matrix components associated with PNs around cortical interneurons and neurons in thalamic nuclei were characterized 1, 7, 14, and 35 days after MCAO, using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degradation of PNs in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core was initiated by loss of WFA-binding matrix components, indicating the cleavage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> chains of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed the subsequent removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> core proteins within the extending microglia/macrophage invasion zone lasting for 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cortical periinfarct region, delineated by an astrocytic scar against the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, the number of WFA-stained and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> core protein-immunoreactive PNs was permanently reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the homolateral ventroposterior thalamus, the delayed decrease in perineuronal matrix was related to the distribution pattern of activated microglia and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded from these results that complementary to the known upregulation of matrix components in the glial scar, deficits in the expression of the neuron-associated extracellular matrix develop in the periinfarct and remote regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These deficits may contribute to the long-lasting functional impairments after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
