<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the first week after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in adult brain, the basal level of neurogenesis increases dramatically in two distinct areas: The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that this remotely induced neurogenesis is the result of a proliferation inducing factor, or factors, diffusing from the infarction to the neurogenic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secreted protein osteopontin (OPN) is a possible factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, OPN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of adult rats that underwent I hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels increased 36.0, 55.0 and 46.7 fold at 6, 24 and 72 hours reperfusion respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also determined whether OPN alone could be responsible for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OPN (2.4 microg/day) was infused into the lateral ventricles of the brain in non-ischemic adult male rats, continuously over three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry was performed and the total BrdU positive (BrdU+) cells were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OPN, compared to aCSF infusion, decreased BrdU+ cells in DG and had no significant effect on cell proliferation in the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that osteopontin alone does not increase cell proliferation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult brain </plain></SENT>
