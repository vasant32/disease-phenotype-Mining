<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pial arterial pressure was measured with a feedback-controlled micropressure recording system in the territory of the occluded artery, and compared with changes of cortical blood flow, cortical steady potential and cortical EEG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> pial artery pressure fell from 56.2 +/- 1.6 to 7.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; during the following two hours it again slowly rose to about 15 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical heat conductance, as a measure of blood flow, decreased from 15.1 +/- 0.2 to 11.9 +/- 0.2 X 10(-4) cal X cm-1 X sec-1 X degrees C-1, and remained at this level throughout the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical steady potential shifted by 9.1 +/- 0.7 mV towards negativity, and EEG amplitude was reduced by about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pial arterial pressure correlated with blood flow, cortical steady potential and EEG amplitude, but not with EEG frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of blood flow were disturbed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculation of extra- and intracortical vascular resistances revealed that this disturbance was entirely due to intracortical vasoparalysis whereas the collateral vessels supplying the ischemic territory continued to react to both pressure and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maintained vascular reactivity of collateral vessels, therefore, is a decisive factor for the efficiency of therapeutic blood flow improvement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
