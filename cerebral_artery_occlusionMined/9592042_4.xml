<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and the penumbra were differentiated by regional ATP and cerebral protein synthesis (CPS) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was restricted to the ischemic penumbra, as defined by the dissociation between preserved ATP and suppressed CPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed not only in the penumbra but also in the peri-ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue in which both ATP and CPS were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate a highly selective differential expression of immediate-early and stress-related genes in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> surrounding which is explained by different mechanisms of gene induction </plain></SENT>
