<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The intraluminal suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model is increasingly used in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to determine whether (1) spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> occurs after different periods of MCAO in this model, (2) hypothalamic injury contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 60, 90, and 120 minutes of transient MCAO (n=8 per group), permanent MCAO (n=8 per group, 5 groups), and permanent hypothalamic occlusion, in which an occluder was inserted 15 to 15.5 mm to block only the hypothalamic branch from the internal carotid artery (n=4) with the use of the intraluminal suture MCAO method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group undergoing permanent MCAO, the body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another group (n=4) undergoing 90 minutes of temporary MCAO, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging were performed to document the in vivo ischemic changes in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was measured hourly for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours (12 hours in 2 permanent MCAO groups), triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was used to verify ischemic hypothalamic injury and to calculate corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (&gt;39 degrees C) occurred in the 120-minute group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> permanent MCAO groups, and the hypothalamic occlusion group but not in the 60-minute or the 90-minute groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypothalamic infarction was found in 1 rat each in the 60-minute and 90-minute groups, 6 of the 8 rats in the 120-minute group, 37 of the 40 rats in the permanent occlusion groups, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 rats in the hypothalamic occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 90 minutes of transient MCAO, the decreased cerebral blood flow and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the hypothalamic region during occlusion recovered fully 2 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were identical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> permanent occlusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intraluminal suture MCAO lasting for &gt;/=2 hours induces spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> that is associated with hypothalamic injury, and delayed spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> does not increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after permanent intraluminal suture MCAO </plain></SENT>
