<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of diffusion kurtosis imaging in an animal model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (N=18) were subjected to 90 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiparametric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 20 minutes after reperfusion with diffusion-weighted MRI obtained using 8 b-values from 250 to 3000 s/mm(2) in 6 diffusion gradient directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion and kurtosis lesions were outlined in shuffled images by 2 investigators independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T(2) MRI was obtained 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean diffusion lesion (23.5%±8.1%, percentage of the brain slice) was significantly larger than mean kurtosis lesion (13.2%±2.0%) during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean diffusion lesion decreased significantly after reperfusion (13.8%±4.3%), whereas mean kurtosis lesion showed little change (13.0%±2.5%) with their lesion size difference being insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that mean diffusion/mean kurtosis mismatch recovered reasonably well on reperfusion, whereas regions with concurrent mean diffusion and mean kurtosis deficits showed poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffusion kurtosis imaging may help stratify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> diffusion-weighted MRI lesions for enhanced characterization of ischemic tissue injury </plain></SENT>
