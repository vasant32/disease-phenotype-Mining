<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether elevated production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> in the cerebral vasculature could contribute to the larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size previously reported after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in hypertensive strains of rat [spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rat (SHRSP)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> in the cerebral vasculature of SHRSP measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was about twice that seen in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with the elevated expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi>)4A protein and CYP4A1 and CYP4A8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume after transient MCAO was greater in SHRSP (36+/-4% of hemisphere volume) than in SHR (19+/-5%) or WKY rats (5+/-2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a significantly greater reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in SHR and SHRSP than in WKY rats during the ischemic period (78% vs. 62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In WKY rats, rCBF returned to 75% of control following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
