<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three and five days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, some neurons in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord underwent degeneration and they appeared to be engulfed by reactive microglia; on the other hand, the ventral horn neurons remained ultrastructurally intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in the dorsal horn was attributed to deafferentation of the local neurons following ischaemic lesion of the corticospinal neurons which are the main source of afferent inputs </plain></SENT>
