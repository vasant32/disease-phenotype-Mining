<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to investigate the dynamic evolution of brain temperature in different ischemic regions in a monkey model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain temperature of different ischemic regions was measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS), and the evolution processes of brain temperature were compared among different ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (baseline) brain temperature of the monkey brain was 37.16 °C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> stage, the mean brain temperature of ischemic tissue was 1.16 °C higher than the baseline; however, this increase was region dependent, with 1.72 °C in the IP, 1.08 °C in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, and 0.62 °C in the oligemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After recanalization, the brain temperature of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core showed a pattern of an initial decrease accompanied by a subsequent increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the brain temperature of the IP and oligemic region showed a monotonously and slowly decreased pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that in vivo measurement of brain temperature could help to identify whether ischemic tissue survives </plain></SENT>
