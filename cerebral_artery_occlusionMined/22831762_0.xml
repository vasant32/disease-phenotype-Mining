<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anticoagulation and thrombolysis to recover blood supply as well as the diminution of neural excitotoxicity to protect brain cells have not shown to fully improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comprehensive mechanisms and medication specificity remain to be addressed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the silence of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by siRNA protects brain tissues from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three groups of Wistar rats, their lateral ventricles received the injections of lentiviral vectors carrying siRNA for PAR1, small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in mismatching PAR1 or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A week after the injections, these rats were treated by one side of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scores of neurological deficits, the volume of ischemic infarction and the expressions of PAR-1, <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 and MAP-2 were measured in 24h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the silence of PAR-1 significantly reduces neurological deficits and infarction volume, as well as elevates <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 and MAP-2 expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the knock-down of PAR1 minimizes the ischemic impairments of cerebral cortex via HSP70 and MAP-2 pathways </plain></SENT>
