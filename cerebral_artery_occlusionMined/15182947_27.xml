<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of Astragaloside IV, a purified extract from Astragalus membranaceus, in a murine model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion produced by transient (1.5 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As determined at 72 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, post-ischemic treatment of Astragaloside IV (20 or 40 mg/kg) markedly and significantly (P &lt; 0.03 vs. vehicle-treated animals) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Astragaloside IV treatment also decreased the levels of malondialdehyde, an indicator of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and increased the levels of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results presented here provide the first evidence of a neuroprotective effect of Astragaloside IV in the model of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the anti-infarction effect by Astragaloside IV may be derived at least in part from its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
