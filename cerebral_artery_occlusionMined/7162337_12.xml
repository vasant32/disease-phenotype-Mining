<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 mg/ml <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> administered intravenously produced a dramatic reversal of neurologic symptoms four hours after the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were then anesthetized and cortical blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the ischemic cortex was noted to be approximately 55% that of the control side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> produced a significant decrease of approximately 20% in cortical blood flow in the ischemic hemisphere while no effect on blood flow on the control side was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> appears to reverse the neurologic deficits following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow to the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
