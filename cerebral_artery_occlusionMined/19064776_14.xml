<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the genomic response of leukocytes and brain cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the context of CpG preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from circulating leukocytes and ischemic cortex 3 and 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after CpG or saline pretreatment and subjected to microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes uniquely upregulated in CpG-pretreated mice were examined for overrepresented transcriptional regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CpG preconditioning induced a novel response to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> within circulating leukocytes that was dominated by natural killer cell-associated genes and the GATA-3 transcriptional regulatory element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning also caused a novel brain response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that was dominated by Type I interferon, interferon-associated genes, and transcriptional regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CpG preconditioning invokes novel leukocyte and brain responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this, CpG may be a unique preconditioning agent, coordinating peripheral and brain responses to protect against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
