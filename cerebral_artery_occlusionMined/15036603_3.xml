<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on calpain activity, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the reperfusion period normothermic temperature was compared to post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calpain expression was measured by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The loss of calpain substrate was determined by immunohistochemistry against the anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase of calpains in the ischemic as compared to the non-ischemic contralateral hemisphere and the loss of MAP-2 were reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that calpain activity and calpain-induced proteolysis play an important role in the network of events following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and can be reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may be a useful tool to limit secondary injury induced by intracellular calpain degradation </plain></SENT>
