<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim:To explore whether the synthetic cannabinoid receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> WIN55,212-2 could protect oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra, thereby providing neuroprotection following permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats.Methods:Adult male SD rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p-MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were administered WIN55,212-2 at 2 h, and sacrificed at 24 h after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra was examined using Western blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological changes and proliferation of neural glial antigen 2-positive OPCs (NG2(+) cells) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra were studied using immunohistochemistry staining.Results:p-MCAO significantly increased the expression of CB1 within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra with the highest level appearing at 2 h following the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of WIN55,212-2 (9 mg/kg, iv) significantly attenuated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as the number of tau-immunoreactive NG2(+) cells (tau-1(+)/NG2(+) cells) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, WIN55,212-2 significantly promoted the proliferation of NG2(+) cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra and in the ipsilateral subventricular zone at 24 h following the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of the selective CB1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> rimonabant (1 mg/kg, iv) partially blocked the effects caused by WIN55,212-2.Conclusion:Tau-1 is expressed in NG2(+) cells following permanent focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with WIN55,212-2 reduces the number of tau-1(+)/NG2(+) cells and promotes NG2(+) cell proliferation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> penumbra, which are mediated partially via CB1 and may contribute to its neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
