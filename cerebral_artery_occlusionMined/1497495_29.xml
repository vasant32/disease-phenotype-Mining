<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lateralization of autonomic representation may also occur in the brain, since inactivation of the left and right hemispheres by intracarotid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2673">amobarbital</z:chebi> produces an increase and decrease in heart rate, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this conclusion has remained tentative, since the differential effect of lateralized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on sympathetic activity has not been studied systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight urethan-anesthetized Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a group given left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and a group given sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, renal sympathetic nerve discharge, and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the 4-hour experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels were measured at baseline and 1 and 4 hours after occlusion or sham occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial pressure decreased in the group given sham operation and to lesser extent in the group given left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, mean arterial pressure did not fall in the group given right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at 4 hours was significantly higher than control values in the sham-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal sympathetic nerve discharge was decreased in the sham-occluded group, increased significantly from 20 minutes to 2 hours in the group given left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and increased from about 20 minutes to the end of the experiment in the group given right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> level was significantly elevated at 1 hour (93%) and 4 hours (44%) only in the group given right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
