<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, sham operation group, model group and ligustrazine treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter two groups were further divided into 5 subgroups for observation at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after reperfusion following a 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells in S phase were labeled with BrdU, and immunohistochemistry was employed to detect BrdU- and nNOS-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ and DG were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of nNOS was detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: nNOS expression increased significantly in the model group as compared to the sham operation group (P&lt;0.05), and ligustrazine treatment significantly lowered the expression level in comparison with the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group, a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells occurred in the SVZ of rats 1 and 3 days after igustrazine treatment (P&lt;0.05), along with an increase of DG BrdU-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine significantly restrains <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury-induced nNOS activity enhancement and promotes cell proliferation in the SVZ and DG of adult rats after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
