<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of numerous studies on the subject, many aspects of the neuroprotective effects of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the action of Semax and its C-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> Pro-Gly-Pro on the expression of the VEGF gene family (Vegf-a, Vegf-b, Vegf-c, Vegf-d, and Plgf) and their receptors (Vegfr-1, Vegfr-2, and Vegfr-3) in the frontoparietal cortex region of the rat brain at 3, 24, and 72 h after permanent left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of the genes studied was assessed using real-time reverse transcription-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Vegf-b and Vegf-d genes were most affected by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, which resulted in their most noticeable activation at 3 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of Vegf-d transcripts decreased considerably, whereas the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of the Vegf-b gene was significantly increased after 72 h of treatment with each of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on the expression of the Vegf-b and Vegf-d genes were the opposite of the action of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the identified effects of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> diminish the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, thus participating in the positive therapeutic effect of Semax on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
