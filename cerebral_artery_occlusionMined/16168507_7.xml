<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro study, HT 22 cells were used to demonstrate that was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm, which coincides with the location of the mitochondria and then its HPF fluorescence gradually increased from 6 to 24 h due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, the permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of enhanced HPF fluorescence existed in both the ischemic core and the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at 4h after MCAO in both permanent and transient MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area extended beyond the boundary of the ischemic damage into biochemically viable tissue </plain></SENT>
