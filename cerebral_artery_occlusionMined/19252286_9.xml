<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that the fruit juice of Morinda citrifolia (M. citrifolia, Noni, Rubiaceae) has various pharmacological effects such as <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> or anti-inflammatory activities, which may help the inhibition of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the effect of the fruit juice of M. citrifolia (Noni juice) on the brain damage caused by ischemic stress in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noni juice was obtained from the mature fruit grown in Okinawa (about 1.5 l/4 kg of fruit; 100% Okinawa Noni juice (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ONJ</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were supplied with 3% or 10% juice in the drinking water for 7 d, and compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 7th day, mice were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the intake of juice reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as analyzed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining on the 3rd day of MCAO when compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the neurological deficit scores (NDS) were decreased after the reperfusion in the juice-supplied mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the intake of juice did not affect the expression levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> such as Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that Noni juice may have a preventive effect against cerebral ischemic stress, while further studies are needed to explain the detailed mechanism </plain></SENT>
