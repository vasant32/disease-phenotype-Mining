<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) has various neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the topographic distribution and cellular source of IL-6 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the localization of IL-6 protein was immunohistochemically examined in rats after 3.5, 12, 24, and 48 hours of reperfusion after 1.5 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the anti-IL-6 antibody used in the current study was confirmed by Western blot analysis and an immunoabsorption test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify the cellular source, lectin histochemical study and immunohistochemical study with microtubule-associated protein-2, ED1, and glial fibrillary acidic protein also were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sham group did not show any clear IL-6 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3.5 hours of reperfusion, IL-6 immunoreactivity was first detected on the reperfused side, and it was upregulated, especially in the periinfarct region, after 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, IL-6 was expressed after 3.5 hours of reperfusion in the contralateral cerebral cortex and bilateral hippocampi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed that the cells containing IL-6 were neurons and round-type microglia, not astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that IL-6 expression in ischemically threatened neurons and reactive microglia is closely associated with brain tissue neuroprotective mechanisms against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
