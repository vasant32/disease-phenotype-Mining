<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the dynamics of reactive astrocytes after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> by examining the expression of Musashi1 (Msi1), an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein and another marker of neural stem/progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ischemic striatum induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), an increase in Msi1-immunoreactivity was observed from 2 days after MCAO, persisting until 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of Msi1-positive cells was observed from 4 days after MCAO and reached a peak at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These Msi1-positive cells were regarded as reactive astrocytes based on their co-expression with GFAP or Nestin and their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Msi1-positive cells were located in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in a region similar, but not identical, to that of Nestin-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Msi1(+)Nestin(+) cells were located much closer to the ischemic core than the Msi1(+)Nestin(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that Msi1-expression, similar to Nestin, is induced after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and may be involved in the reactivation of astrocytes, including their proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the difference in the distributions of Msi1 and Nestin suggests that some of their features may differ in reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
