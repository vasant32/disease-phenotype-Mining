<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several reports recently suggested that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may have a therapeutic benefit against experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are known to have therapeutic potency in improving neurological deficits after occlusive cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that intracerebral transplantation of VEGF gene-transferred BMSCs could provide a greater therapeutic effect than intracerebral transplantation of native (non-gene-transformed) BMSCs by using a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Wistar rats (Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) were anesthetized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEGF gene-transferred BMSCs engineered with a replication-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 1764/4-/pR19-hVEGF165 vector, native BMSCs, or phosphate-buffered saline were administered intracerebrally 24 hours after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent behavioral testing for 28 days, and the infarction volume was determined 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain water contents in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of the MCAO were measured 2 and 7 days after the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days after MCAO, immunohistochemical staining for VEGF was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group receiving VEGF-modified BMSCs demonstrated significant functional recovery compared with those receiving native BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days after the MCAO, there was a significantly lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume without aggravating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in the group treated with VEGF gene-modified BMSCs compared with the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transplanted VEGF gene-modified BMSCs strongly expressed VEGF protein for at least 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the intracerebral transplantation of VEGF gene-transferred BMSCs may provide a more potent autologous cell transplantation therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than the transplantation of native BMSCs alone </plain></SENT>
