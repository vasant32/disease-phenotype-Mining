<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps obtained by conventional pulsed gradient spin echo diffusion-weighted imaging (PGSE-DWI) were compared with maps of the trace of the diffusion tensor in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and occluded animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor trace maps were derived from the average of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps from three separate experiments with diffusion weighting along three orthogonal axes, and also from a single-scan method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked degree of diffusion anisotropy was observed in both cortical gray matter and white matter from <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps of the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the occluded animals, the systematic effects of anisotropy on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and lesion area influenced the delineation of the ischemic territory in the PGSE-DWI <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the two trace methods eliminated these effects and gave consistent ischemic lesion depiction, despite the use of differing diffusion times in the two measurements </plain></SENT>
