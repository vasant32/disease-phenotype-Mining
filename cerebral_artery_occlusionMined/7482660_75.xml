<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and of petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is connected to altered vascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major part in microvascular integrity is played by the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The fates of the basal lamina components laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 hours, n = 3) and occlusion (3 hours) with reperfusion (1 hour, n = 3; 4 hours, n = 3; and 24 hours, n = 4) were evaluated in the nonhuman primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific monoclonal antibodies against these components were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number and size distribution of the microvessels in each specimen were determined by video-imaging microscopy, and the relative fluorescence intensity of laminin was semiquantified by laser confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal lamina antigen presentations were compared by double-stain immunofluorescence histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of microvascular structures defined by the presence of each basal lamina antigen decreased significantly up to 24 hours of reperfusion (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of laminin-containing vessels between the ischemic and nonischemic territories decreased significantly from control (0.98 +/- 0.04) to 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (0.83 +/- 0.09) and 1 hour (0.79 +/- 0.08), 4 hours (0.77 +/- 0.06), and 24 hours of reperfusion (0.55 +/- 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of fibronectin (cellular) and of collagen (IV)-containing vessels decreased from 0.98 +/- 0.04 to 0.75 +/- 0.1 and from 1.02 +/- 0.03 to 0.57 +/- 0.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean laminin fluorescence intensity decreased from 76.1 +/- 6.0 U (controls) to 52.0 +/- 14.6 U (24 hours of reperfusion; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significant parallel losses of three basal lamina components, both in number and intensity, contribute to loss of microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These phenomena may be important for understanding cell extravasation and the hemorrhagic consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
