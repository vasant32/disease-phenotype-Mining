<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of shenqi fuzheng injection (SFI) in inducing differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in brain stem and its effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function in model rats of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model rats were made, and hMSCs was injected into their brain after being amplified in vitro and incubated with SFI for 0.5 h, then the survival, migration and differentiation of hMSCs in brain stem as well as the change of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function in model rats were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The post-transplantation reject reaction to hMSCs was low, it could survive as long as 6 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference in area of infarction was shown before and after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that hMSCs expressed human neuron specific enolase (NSE), neurofilament (NF) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The limb-kinetic function and tactile perception were improved in the model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SFI can induce hMSCs differentiate into neurons in vivo, and hMSCs may be the ideal germinal cells for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
