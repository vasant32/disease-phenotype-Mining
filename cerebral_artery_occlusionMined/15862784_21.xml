<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the in vivo study, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> at 90 mg/kg intraperitoneally administered 60 min before or 30 min after (but not 4 h after) the occlusion reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infarction, brain</z:e> swelling, and neurologic deficits at 24 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the in vitro studies, we used cortical-neuron cultures from rat fetuses in which neurotoxicity was induced by 24-h exposure to 500 microM <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> [such as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in mouse forebrain homogenates and free radical-scavenging activity against diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)] were evaluated to clarify the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 2 microM and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and free radical scavenging at 0.2 and 2 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> has neuroprotective effects in vivo against permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in vitro against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and that an inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> may be partly responsible for these effects </plain></SENT>
