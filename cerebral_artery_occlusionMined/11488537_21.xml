<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signaling chemokines orchestrate the communication between the different inflammatory cell types and the damaged tissue leading to cellular chemotaxis and lesion occupation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several therapies aimed at preventing this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> have demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but to date, few investigators have used the chemokines as potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors investigate the neuroprotective action of NR58-3.14.3, a novel broad-spectrum inhibitor of chemokine function (both CXC and CC types), in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 90 minutes of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by the filament method followed by 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the lesion volume, measured by serial magnetic resonance imaging, and the neurologic function were assessed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous NR58-3.14.3 was administered, 2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg hour constant infusion for the entire 72-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours, the cerebral leukocytic infiltrate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-8 (IL-8)-like cytokines were analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NR58-3.14.3 significantly reduced the lesion volume by up to 50% at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which was associated with a marked functional improvement to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In NR58-3.14.3-treated rats, the number of infiltrating granulocytes and macrophages within perilesional regions were reduced, but there were no detectable differences in inflammatory cell numbers within core ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors reported increased expression of the cytokines, TNF-alpha, and IL-8-like cytokines within the ischemic lesion, but no differences between the NR58-3.14.3-treated rats and controls were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although chemokines can have pro- or antiinflammatory action, these data suggest the overall effect of chemokine up-regulation and expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury is detrimental to outcome </plain></SENT>
