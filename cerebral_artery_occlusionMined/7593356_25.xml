<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that supports the survival of brain cells (including neurons, glia, and endothelia) and protects neurons against a number of toxins and insults in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This factor is also a potent dilator of cerebral pial arterioles in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we found that intraventricularly administered bFGF reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, bFGF (45 micrograms/kg/h) in vehicle, or vehicle alone, was infused intravenously for 3 h, beginning at 30 min after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture in mature Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, neurological deficit (as assessed by a 0- to 5-point scale, with 5 = most severe) was 2.6 +/- 1.0 in vehicle-treated and 1.5 +/- 1.3 in bFGF-treated rats (mean +/- SD; N = 12 vs. 11; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was 297 +/- 65 mm3 in vehicle- and 143 +/- 135 mm3 in bFGF-treated animals (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During infusion, there was a modest decrease in mean arterial blood pressure but no changes in arterial blood gases or core or brain temperature in bFGF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoradiography following intravenous administration of 111In-labeled bFGF showed that labeled bFGF crossed the damaged blood-brain barrier to enter the ischemic (but not the nonischemic) hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-reducing effects of bFGF depend on intraparenchymal or intravascular mechanisms requires further study </plain></SENT>
