<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The behavior of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) was studied in cats following release after 1-h middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was determined by hydrogen clearance method in the caudate nucleus and the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was assayed with Evans blue (EB) tracer and by immunohistochemical peroxidase-antiperoxidase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following release of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, there were two openings of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, separated by a refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first opening, occurred shortly after recirculation; this was associated with rCBF below 15 ml/100 g/min during the ischemic period and a pronounced reactive hyperemia promptly following release of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A refractory period of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was indicated by the absence of EB leakage in cats injected with the tracer 30 min before killing at 3 h after recirculation, although the rCBF values in these animals were even lower (6 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min) during occlusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed a pronounced hyperemia after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the previous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> opening in these animals was confirmed by the <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was observed at 5 and 72 h after recirculation in cats which were injected with EB 30 min before killing, and which showed rCBF below 15 ml/100 g/min during occlusion, followed by a pronounced reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No EB extravasations were observed at any time in cats in which the rCBF during occlusion was above 15 ml/100 g/min and which failed to show a marked reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
