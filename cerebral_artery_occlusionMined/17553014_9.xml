<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male Sprague-Dawley rats, endurance exercise would act synergistically with a challenging skilled forelimb task to facilitate motor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to one of four rehabilitation conditions: no rehabilitation, running only, reach training only, and reach training preceded by running (run/reach training) for 5 weeks beginning 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behavioral outcome, morphological change and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of proteins implicated in neuroplasticity (BDNF, synapsin I and microtubule-associated protein 2) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endurance exercise on a motorized running wheel, prior to reach training, enhanced recovery of skilled reaching ability but did not transfer to gross motor skills such as postural support (forelimb asymmetry test) and gait (ladder rung walking test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microtubule-associated protein 2 staining density in the run/reach group was slightly enhanced in the contralateral motor cortex compared with the contralateral sensory and ipsilateral cingulate cortices, suggesting that running preceding reach training may have resulted in more dendritic branching within the motor cortex in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were detected among the training paradigms; however, there was a trend toward greater BDNF and synapsin I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the reaching groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that exercise facilitates learning of subsequent challenging reaching tasks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which has the potential to optimize outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
