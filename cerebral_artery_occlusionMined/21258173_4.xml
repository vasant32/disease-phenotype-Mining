<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Orexin-A is a newly identified neuropeptide expressed in the lateral areas of the hypothalamus that plays a role in various physiological functions, including regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> is one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of orexin-A on the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was estimated by histological and behavioral analysis after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A (2.5, 25, or 250 pmol/mouse) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> on day 1 after MCAO and neuronal damage on day 3 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the liver and skeletal muscle, the expression levels of insulin receptor were decreased, whereas those of gluconeogenic enzymes were increased on day 1 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these expressions were completely recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels by orexin-A and were reversed by the administration of SB334867, a specific orexin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that regulation of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> by orexin-A suppressed cerebral ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
