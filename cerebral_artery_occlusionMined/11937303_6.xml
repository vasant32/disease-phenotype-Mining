<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to measure nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and examined how ICV administration of NPY or its receptor analogs would modulate the brain NO level between the bregma levels +2 and -4 mm during MCAO, since excessive NO mediates ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative brain NO concentration was increased to 131.94 +/- 7.99% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>; n = 8) at 15 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPY treatment further increased the relative brain NO concentration to 250.94 +/- 50.48% (n = 8), whereas BIBP3226 significantly reduced the brain NO concentration to 69.63 +/- 8.84% (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[Leu(31),Pro(34)]-NPY (137.61 +/- 14.54%; n = 7) or NPY3-36 (129.23 +/- 21.77%; n = 8) did not affect the brain NO concentration at 15 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the NPY-Y1 receptor activation mediates ischemic injury via NO overproduction and that inhibition of the Y1 receptor may confer protection via suppression of excessive NO production during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
