<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggested that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) may aggravate ischemic injury by enhancing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remained unclear whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> signalling is also relevant for t-PA toxicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein examined effects of intravenous t-PA (10 mg/kg), administered alone or in combination with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg), following 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, MK-801 alone, administered intraperitoneally, neither affected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>t-PA significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, in accordance with previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>t-PA-induced ischemic injury was completely abolished and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> markedly reduced when t-PA-treated animals received additional MK-801 injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To elucidate how t-PA influences brain damage, we examined actions of t-PA on the expression of NO synthases by immunohistochemistry, showing that t-PA does not influence neuronal NO synthase, but increases inducible NO synthase in ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of t-PA on inducible NO synthase levels was completely reversed after cotreatment with MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study provides in vivo evidence in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that t-PA-induced brain injury involves an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
