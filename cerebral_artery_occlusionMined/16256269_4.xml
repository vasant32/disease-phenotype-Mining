<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated to what extent the antioxidative hydroxystilbene oxyresveratrol (trans-2,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene, OXY), that we showed earlier to be strongly neuroprotective in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, may cross the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) in healthy rats and in subjects submitted to focal infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue extraction and in vivo microdialysis in the striatum show that systematically applied OXY is able to penetrate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in control animals, but to a low extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis samples from animals that were subjected to a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) displayed strongly increased OXY levels (more than six-fold) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region as compared to sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data show that OXY may exert direct protective effects in the brain by crossing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and may prove an excellent complementary drug for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> that causally involve oxidative/nitrosative stress, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
