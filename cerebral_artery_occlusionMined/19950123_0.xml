<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been suggested that the mismatch between regions displaying 'large abnormal perfusion' and 'small abnormal diffusion' indicates a treatable area on an MRI, it has also been reported that the mismatch region is an imperfect approximation of the treatable region named the 'penumbra' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi> accumulation reflecting calcium influx into cells was reported previously in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model using activity-induced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-enhanced (AIM) MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the super-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, there have been no reports about mismatches between areas showing changes to the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and regions that are enhanced in AIM MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is expected that the AIM signal can be enhanced immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the necrotic core region due to calcium influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, a remote embolic rat model, created using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32234">titanium-oxide</z:chebi> macrospheres, was used to observe necrotic neural responses in the super-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, images were evaluated by comparison between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, AIM MRI, and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The signal enhancement in AIM MRI was detected at 2 min after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> using a remote embolic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The enhanced area on the AIM MRI was significantly smaller than that on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tissue degeneration highlighted by histological analysis corresponded more closely to the enhanced area on the AIM MRI than that on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-enhanced region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> might indicate 'necrotic' irreversible tissue that underwent calcium influx </plain></SENT>
