<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Native (pre-existing) collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses that interconnect adjacent arterial trees and serve as endogenous bypass vessels that limit tissue injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, coronary and peripheral artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their extent (number and diameter) varies widely among mouse strains and healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7 (Canq1, LOD = 29) responsible for 37% of the heritable variation in collateral extent between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify candidate genes in Canq1 responsible for collateral variation in the cerebral pial circulation, a tissue whose strain-dependent variation is shared by similar variation in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Collateral extent was intermediate in a recombinant inbred line that splits Canq1 between the C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotyping and SNP-mapping of an expanded panel of twenty-one informative inbred strains narrowed the Canq1 locus, and genome-wide linkage analysis of a SWRxSJL-F2 cross confirmed its haplotype structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral extent, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, and re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time did not differ in knockout mice for two vascular-related genes located in Canq1, IL4ra and Itgal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcript abundance of 6 out of 116 genes within the 95% confidence interval of Canq1 were differentially expressed &gt;2-fold (p-value&lt;0.05÷150) in the cortical pia mater from C57BL/6 and BALB/c embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 time-points that span the period of collateral formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings refine the Canq1 locus and identify several genes as high-priority candidates important in specifying native collateral formation and its wide variation </plain></SENT>
