<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> activity in the limbic system and the effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> on the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) axis throughout both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The changes in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> content in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> cell gap, in corticotrophin releasing hormone (CHR) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level in brain tissue, and in adrenocorticotropic hormone in blood plasma at different time-points after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats were determined respectively with high-performance liquid chomatography (HPLC) and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> content in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus increased rapidly at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 15 minutes, and reached peak value (the averages were 21.05 mg/g +/- 2.88 mg/g and 14.20 mg/g +/- 2.58 mg/g, respectively) at 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During recirculation, it returned rapidly to the baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after reperfusion, it went up once more, and remained at a relative high level until 48 hours after reperfusion, and then declined gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in the temporal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus were enhanced markedly at 1 hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and were maintained until 96 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, adrenocorticotropic hormone level in plasma was relatively increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the peak stage of reperfusion injury, there was a significantly positive correlation (n = 15, r = 0.566, P &lt; 0.05) of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> contents in the hypothalamus with the number of cells positive for CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is probable that the CRH system in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is mainly distributed in the limbic system, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> might be one of the trigger factors to induce excessive stress response in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
