<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous research highlighted an inconsistency with Notch1 signaling-related compensatory neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild stress (CMS) in rodents suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which continue to display post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesize that CMS aggrandized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> injury and worsened synaptic integrity via gamma secretase-meditated Notch1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were exposed to a CMS paradigm after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Open-field and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption testing were employed to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and synaptic density-related synaptophysin were measured by western blotting and real-time PCR on Day 28 after MCAO surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMS induced depressive behaviors in ischemic rats, which was accompanied by an elevation in Bax/bcl-2 ratio, TUNEL staining in neurons and reduced synaptophysin expression in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These collective effects were reversed by the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32433">L-alanyl</z:chebi>)]-S-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-glycine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">t-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stressors made neurons in the dentate gyrus vulnerable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which supports a putative role for Notch signaling in neural integrity, potentially in newborn cells' synaptic deficit with regard to preexisting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> therapeutically benefits from blocking gamma secretase mediated Notch signaling, and whether this signaling pathway could be a therapeutic target needs to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
