<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The rat group with treadmill training (n = 10) were compared with the rat group without treadmill training (n = 10) after 2.5 hrs of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor performance measured by the rotarod test and alteration of protein expression using two-dimensional electrophoresis based on proteomics in the cerebellum were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In behavioral evaluation, the mean latency until falling from the rotating rod in the group with treadmill training was significantly longer (P &lt; 0.01) than that in the group without treadmill training 24 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for protein expression, it was revealed by proteome analysis and Western blotting that the expression of the two protein spots, 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein, were significantly enhanced in the cerebellum of rats with treadmill training than that in rats without a treadmill training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein may be related to the underlying mechanisms of improvement of motor coordination and exercise-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, that is, remodeling of synaptic connections and proliferation of astroglial cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
