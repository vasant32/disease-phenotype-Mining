<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in cat cortex in vivo during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced by 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and during 30 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi>/reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>) redox state and hemodynamic changes were measured simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals showing severe deterioration in their electroencephalograms (EEG) showed a progressive increase in the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i signal during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (baseline: 1.46 +/- 0.05; 60 minutes after occlusion: 2.99 +/- 0.37; n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 30 minutes following reperfusion, the animals showing little recovery in their EEG exhibited a further increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i (4.71 +/- 0.87, n = 3), whereas animals showing significant recovery in their EEG also showed recovery of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i (1.55 +/- 0.09, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the moderate or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals with less deterioration in their EEGs showed no increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i during either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i might be closely related not only to deterioration of brain function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but also to poor recovery during the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
