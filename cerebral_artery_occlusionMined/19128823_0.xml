<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to explore the therapeutic time window and mechanism of tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi> on temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats and 20 mg/kg of tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi> was intraperitoneally injected at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 72 h after reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals' neurologic deficit scores were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrums were removed and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was determined at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> volume and neurological deficit scores were significantly decreased in the group with tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase-2 was significantly decreased in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, while it was increased by tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi>, within 4 h after reperfusion, protects the brain from ischemic reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective mechanism of tetramethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30953">pyrazine</z:chebi> treatment is, in part, mediated through the upregulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> transcription </plain></SENT>
