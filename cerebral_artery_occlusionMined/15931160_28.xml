<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the blood-brain barrier is transiently disrupted, allowing leukocytes to enter the brain and brain antigens to enter the peripheral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This encounter of normally sequestered brain antigens by the systemic immune system could therefore present an opportunity for an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to brain to occur after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the immune response to myelin basic protein (MBP) in animals subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some animals received an intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS; 1 mg/kg) at reperfusion to stimulate a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 month after MCAO, animals exposed to LPS were more likely to be sensitized to MBP (66.7% versus 22.2%; P=0.007) and had more profound and persistent neurologic deficits than non-LPS-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to LPS was associated with increased expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P=0.009) and increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> 1 month after MCAO (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that animals subjected to a systemic inflammatory insult at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are predisposed to develop an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to brain, and that this response is associated with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data may partially explain why patients who become infected after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> experience increased morbidity </plain></SENT>
