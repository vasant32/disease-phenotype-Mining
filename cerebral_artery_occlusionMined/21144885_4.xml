<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hematic administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may not only be an effective reparative treatment but also a brain protective therapy that improves neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to study whether either i.v. or intracarotid (i.c.) administration of allogenic MSCs during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase were effective in improving neurological recovery and decreasing brain damage in an experimental rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), we analyzed: neurological evaluation; MSCs migration and implantation; interleukin-6 (IL-6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) levels; lesion volume; cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; cellular proliferation; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and blood vessel number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the administration route, treated groups showed better neurological recovery, without significant differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Migration and implantation of MSCs in the lesion area was observed in animals receiving i.c. but not i.v. treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest cytokine values were observed in the i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSCs and i.c. control groups, and these levels were significantly different from the corresponding i.v. control and i.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSCs groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were significant differences between the i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MSCs and i.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSCs groups in IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither treatment reduced infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, measured as TUNEL+ cells was decreased with significant differences between control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BrdU+ cells were also significantly increased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>VEGF expression was significantly higher in the i.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MSCs group than in the i.c. control group and blood vessel number was significantly higher in treated groups than control groups with significant differences in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allogenic MSCs administration shows therapeutic efficacy in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both routes demonstrably improved neurological recovery and provided brain protection </plain></SENT>
