<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used the characteristic spectrum of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52088">methoxycarbonyl</z:chebi>-PROXYL to detect free radical reactions in hydrophilic and lipophilic compartments in a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52088">Methoxycarbonyl</z:chebi>-PROXYL, which has a high water/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37868">octanol</z:chebi> partition coefficient, allows the detection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxyl radical</z:chebi> in both compartments simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free radicals generation was analysed from the enhanced ESR signal decay rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52088">methoxycarbonyl</z:chebi>-PROXYL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signal decay rate in the lipidic compartment was significantly enhanced 1 h after reperfusion following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enhanced signal decay rate was significantly suppressed by Trolox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products increased by 6 h post-reperfusion and was suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52088">methoxycarbonyl</z:chebi>-PROXYL or Trolox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that information pertaining to different sites of free radical generation in vivo can be obtained simultaneously and that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-derived radicals are generated in transient MCAO mice </plain></SENT>
