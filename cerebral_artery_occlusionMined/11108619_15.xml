<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical T(1), as quantified with an inversion recovery method, increased by 4-7% within a few minutes of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at 4.7 and 9.4 T, but a significantly smaller change was detected at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial T(1) change occurred within seconds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, much earlier than the extensive diffusion drop after 1-2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the initial increase in T(1) upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is directly caused by cessation of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), prolonged T(1) relaxation was detected within 10 min, with a subsequent increase during the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spin density did not change during the first hour, showing that T(1) increase was not caused by net accumulation of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, partial recovery of T(1) upon release of MCAO, occurring independent of long-term tissue outcome, was observed only in concert with diffusion recovery </plain></SENT>
