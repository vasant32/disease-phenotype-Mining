<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> was determined by measurement of the rate of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> accumulation in tissue following injection of amino oxyacetic acid (AOAA; 30 mg/kg, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five min following the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the rate of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> synthesis in the right (ischaemic) cortex was decreased by approximately 70% compared to either the left cortex or the right cortex of untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> concentration was however unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hours after the occlusion the rate of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> synthesis was similar in the right and left cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> accumulation in the cerebellum was unchanged at both times after the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion compared with untreated control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that there is a rapid but short lasting decrease in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> synthesis following an ischaemic insult and it is suggested that this might be associated with the EEG spiking activity that occurs at this time </plain></SENT>
