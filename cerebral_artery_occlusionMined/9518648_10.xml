<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of BBB022, a type IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 120 min of temporary MCAo by retrograde intraluminal insertion of a nylon suture coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug (BBB022 in saline, 1 mg kg-1 h-1, i.v.) or vehicle (0.9% saline, 1-2 ml kg-1 h-1) was administered by infusion after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four animal groups were studied: Groups A and B were treated by infusion of vehicle or drug over 5 h, and groups C and D over 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damage to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was judged by extravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye, which was administered i.v. at 3 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo in groups A and B; and at 46 h in groups C and D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorometric quantitation of EB was performed 1 or 2 h later in six brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 5-h infusion series (group B), BBB022 decreased dye extravasation in the ipsilateral cortex, striatum and hemisphere (hemisphere mean+/-S.E.M. : 41.2+/-5.4 vs. 82.4+/-9.2 microg/g, p=0.005) compared to the vehicle-treated group (A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 48-h infusion of BBB022 (group D) also decreased dye extravasation in the ipsilateral cortex (7.4+/-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 vs. 29.0+/-8.3 microg/g, p=0.05), striatum (17.2+/-2.2 vs. 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8+/-12.1 microg/g, p=0.03) and hemisphere (30.7+/-4.0 vs. 93.2+/-18 microg/g, p=0.01) compared to the vehicle-treated group (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BBB022 also significantly improved the neurological score at 3 and 5 h after MCAo (in the 5-h infusion group) and at 60 min, 24 h and 48 h (in the 48-h infusion group) compared to the vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that BBB022 prevents ischemic damage to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
