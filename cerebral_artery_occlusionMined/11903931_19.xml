<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo>, such as increased slow delta activity, voltage <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and epileptiform discharge, have been identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, preclinical use of EEG analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> is less documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a new rat model of EEG topographic mapping during permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten EEG electrodes were implanted on the rat skull, symmetrically covering the cortical regions of two hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monopolar EEG recordings were acquired from each animal at multiple time points during the initial 24 h, and again once daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Traditional EEG examinations, quantitative EEG (qEEG) spectral analysis and topographic EEG mapping were employed for comprehensive data analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several distinct spatiotemporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> were identified in the ischaemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral hemisphere, pronounced increase in delta activity was observed in each recorded area within 24 h of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While sharp waves and spike complexes dominated the parietal region, a nearly isoelectric EEG state was seen in the temporal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 48 h, spontaneous, albeit incomplete, recovery of EEG activities developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion appeared to promote delta and alpha recovery more efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The contralateral EEG changes were also recorded in two phases: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> moderate increase in delta activities with intermittent rhythmic activities, followed by a delayed and significant increase in beta activities across the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The similarities of rat qEEG profiles identified in this study to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and the application of topographic mapping broaden our research technology for preclinical experimental studies of brain injury </plain></SENT>
