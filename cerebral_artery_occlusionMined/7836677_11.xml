<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the reproducibility of the model and examine the neuroprotective efficacy of the potent anti-ischaemic agent, MK801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male SD rats received MK801 (5 mg/kg, n = 7) or saline vehicle (n = 7) 30 mins prior to the microinjection of Et-1 (60 pmol in 3 microliters) via a 31-g cannula stereotaxically positioned 0.5 mm above the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three days after the injection of Et-1, rats were perfusion fixed, the brain removed, cryostat sectioned and processed for histological staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections at eight predetermined levels were examined by light microscopy and the volume of infarction calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following administration of Et-1, saline-pretreated rats exhibited a pattern of ischaemic damage similar to that previously reported following permanent occlusion of the rat middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern was characterised by a large volume of infarction covering the dorsal and lateral neocortex (98 +/- 12 mm3) and striatum (32 +/- 3 mm3) ipsilateral to the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Power analysis predicted a group size of 7 would be required for a 50% reduction in ischaemic damage to be recorded as statistically significant at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK801 reduced cortical tissue damage by 51% (P = 0.026) but did not significantly alter either the pattern or volume of infarction (33 +/- 4 mm3; P = 0.95) in the striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
