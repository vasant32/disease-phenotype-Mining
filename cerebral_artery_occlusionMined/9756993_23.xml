<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD), used to precondition rat brain, reduced cortical infarction volume resulting from focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this protective effect by CSD remains to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we confirm that CSD is neuroprotective when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> is applied epidurally rather than intracortically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 101.3+/-48.5 mm3 and 45.3+/-44.1 mm3 in the sham and CSD group, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using image analysis, we identified the cortical region spared from infarction by the prior CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then determined the distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the time course of their expression in groups of animals treated with CSD and their controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined the response of astrocytes to CSD using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization (done at 0, 3, 12, 24, 72 or 168 h after CSD) showed significant elevation of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cortex immediately after CSD in a distribution surrounding the spared cortex, while bFGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> rose 12 h after CSD and appeared more within the core of the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (done at 1, 3 or 7 days after CSD) demonstrated GFAP in the neocortex, with a peak at 3 days after CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) expression was not affected by CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that upregulation of trophic factors and activation of glial cells may contribute to the neuroprotection induced by CSD </plain></SENT>
