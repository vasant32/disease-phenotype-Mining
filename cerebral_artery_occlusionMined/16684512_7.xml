<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways are activated that include unfolded protein response (UPR) and protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both of these mechanisms aim to restore ER functioning mainly by inhibition of translation and increased processing of excess proteins in ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were interested in the role of these pathways during spontaneous recovery after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous recovery of rats was assessed with a limb-placing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of ER-stress-related genes (IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, eif2alpha, ATF4, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>) was studied by using in situ hybridization in different brain areas on post-operative days 2, 7, 14 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated signals were detected in striatum contralateral to the lesion on days 2 (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> and IRE1) and 14 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (IRE1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was elevated on day 7 in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion (ATF6 and GRP78) and on day 14 (GRP78) post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elevated levels of GRP78 were detected on day 14 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that altered gene expression related to unfolded protein response may be more long lasting than expected following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these results show that the response to ER stress differs ipsi- and contralaterally after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since these differences are detected in both hemispheres only in areas adjacent to the lesion, UPR may contribute to spontaneous recovery after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
