<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to trigger quiescent astrocytes into reactive astrocytes in response to several neural injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of EGFR blockade in cultured astrocytes exposure to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes in primary culture were used for OGD/R model and adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle progression of astrocytes in vitro was studied by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cell proliferation-related molecules in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by immunostaining and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
