<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XQ-1H exerts neuroprotective effects under various neurotoxic conditions in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo, it reduces brain damage after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the dose effectiveness and therapeutic time window of neuroprotection of XQ-1H by behavioral and histological measures in rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, TTC stain, brain water content, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> neuron counts, and Evans-Blue extravasation were used to quantify brain damage and blood-brain barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that postischemic treatment with XQ-1H at a dose of 31.2 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in neurological scores when treatment was initiated within 2 h of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar improvement was also observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, brain water content, Evans-Blue extravasation, and neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> when treatment was initiated within 1 h of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with XQ-1H at the dose of 15.6 mg/kg within 1 h also produced significant improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the therapeutic time window of XQ-1H extends for up to 1 h after pMCAO, and treatment with XQ-1H exhibits potent neuroprotection that may be of value for the design of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
