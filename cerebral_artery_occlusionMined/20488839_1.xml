<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 2 hours followed by reperfusion for 22 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, grip strength and locomotor activity tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were immediately sacrificed, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured followed by the estimation of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the whole brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Locomotor activity and grip strength were improved in IRB- and ASP-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced in both IRB and ASP pretreatment as compared with MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) and a reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes viz. <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase were observed following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of IRB and ASP showed the reduction in TBARS, elevation in GSH, SOD and catalase levels as compared with MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of IRB, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> having affinity for AT(1) receptor subtypes, could be due to inhibition of AT( 1) receptor expression in addition to its neuroprotective and free radical scavenging properties in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, it may be possible that the combination of IRB and ASP may be useful as an add-on therapy and would yield beneficial effects, if administered immediately following the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in reducing the severity of the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, our results are preliminary, further studies with posttreatment of IRB and ASP are required to provide more firm view </plain></SENT>
