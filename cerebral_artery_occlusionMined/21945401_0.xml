<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hippocampi alter in patients at the recovery stage of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and whether the changes of hippocampi involve in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with unilateral infarction solely in MCAO territory and 44 age-, sex- and education background-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (3D FSPGR) and sing-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) protocols at a 1.5 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratios of n-acetylaspartate/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (mI/Cr) were obtained by using software integrated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal volumes were estimated by manually measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio were found significantly decreased and mI/Cr ratio significantly increased in the hippocampus ipsilateral to occluded middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) as compared with values in the contralateral hippocampus or healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio was also observed in contralateral hippocampus compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The shrinkage ratio of hippocampus ipsilateral to MCAO was found related to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study identified that the hippocampal secondary damage occurred in patients after MCAO, and it could be evaluated noninvasively by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (1)H MRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the hippocampal secondary damage in MCAO patients indeed contributed to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
