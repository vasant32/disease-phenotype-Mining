<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it is a severe and complex problem, several studies have been done aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of the ischemic phenomenon and aiming to abolish or to diminish its effects, using drugs that protect the neurons from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> with emphasis to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> by its high concentration in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the rat through the dosage of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and morphological findings, and to evaluate a possible protective effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6128">ketoprofen</z:chebi> to ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six rats Wistar were divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first was a control group, the second a sham group and the animals of the third and fourth groups were submitted to induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> through selective obstruction of the midlle cerebral artery during 15, 30 and 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals of the fourth group were previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6128">ketoprofen</z:chebi> 15 minutes before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was evaluated through the histopathological examination and through dosage of the extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The histopathological examination showed that there was no difference between the animals of the control and of the sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the animals submitted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> histopathological alterations appeared at 30 minutes and become more intense at 45 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main findings were interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, chromatinic disorganization, vacuolization and nuclear desintegration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6128">ketoprofen</z:chebi> showed similar alterations, but they were less intense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Decrease in the dosage of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the parietal cortex of the animals submitted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> started at 30 minutes and became more intense at 45 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and was similar for animals previously treated or not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6128">ketoprofen</z:chebi>, indicating that this drug seems not to interfere with the metabolism of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> at the synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The morphological findings in the parietal cortex of the animals submitted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, previously treated or not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6128">ketoprofen</z:chebi>, suggest that this drug has a neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
