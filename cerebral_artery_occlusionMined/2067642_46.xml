<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected no differences in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability among three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, both during and after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in this model </plain></SENT>
