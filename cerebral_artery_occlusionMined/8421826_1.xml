<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment with hydralazine for 10 weeks but not 6 weeks reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in 13-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine whether the duration of treatment needed to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size depends on how long <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is present before the initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 6 weeks and 10-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats for 10 weeks with 20 mg/kg hydralazine added daily to the drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were then subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by tandem permanent common carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood pressure in the treated groups was lower than that in the untreated groups for the entire treatment period in both experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in 10-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for 10 weeks, but not in 6-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for 6 weeks, was significantly less than in untreated controls (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in spontaneously hypertensive rats after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and demonstrates that the effect appears to be independent of the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> before the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
