<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Salidroside (Sal) is a natural <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> extracted from the root of Rhodiola rosea L. that elicits neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tyrosol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> (Tyr), an analog of Sal, was recently synthesized in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to investigate and compare the neuroprotective effects of Sal and Tyr against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sal and Tyr significantly prevented a cerebral ischemic injury induced by a 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a 24 h reperfusion in rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the oxidative insult was markedly attenuated by treatments of Sal and Tyr in the cultured rat cortical neurons after a 30 min exposure to 50 Î¼M of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that Sal and Tyr decreased the expression of Bax and restored the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of these two analogues show that Tyr has a better antioxidative action compared with Sal both in vivo and in vitro, and suggest that the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of Sal and Tyr may be partly due to their different substituents in their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24403">glycosyl groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This gives a new insight into the development of therapeutic natural <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
