<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the natural history of these lesions remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a mouse (C57BL/6J) model of multiple diffuse microinfarcts induced by unilateral internal carotid artery injection of cholesterol crystals (40-70 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microinfarcts were spread throughout the deep cortex, subcortical tissue, and hippocampus and were comprised of a core positive for CD68 (a marker for reactive microglia and macrophages), surrounded by large regions of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Widespread reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, including mislocalization of the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 persisted long after injury, recovering only after 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the cortex, neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> progressed gradually over the first month, from ∼35% at 3 d to 60% at 28 d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> was also observed in lesions, beginning 28 d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that microinfarct development follows a distinct course compared to larger regional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> such as those induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> suggest that the therapeutic window for microinfarcts may be much wider (perhaps days to weeks) than for larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
