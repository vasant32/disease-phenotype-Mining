<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by permanent occlusion of one middle cerebral artery and the animals were killed by transcardiac perfusion fixation 6 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with D-CPPene (1.5, 4.5, or 15 mg/kg, administered intravenously 15 minutes prior to occlusion, with subsequent drug infusions to maintain a plateau in the plasma drug concentrations) effected dose-dependent reductions in the volume of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose studied (15 mg/kg, plus an infusion of 170 micrograms/kg/min), D-CPPene reduced the volume of ischemic damage in the cerebral cortex by more than 75% compared to vehicle-treated control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of D-CPPene, which is associated with a half maximal reduction in the volume of ischemic damage, was estimated to be 24 micrograms/ml during the initial 120 minutes after the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with D-CPPene (15 mg/kg, plus an infusion of 170 micrograms/kg/min) initiated 1 hour after occlusion reduced the volume of ischemic brain damage in the cerebral cortex by 30%, but this response did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
