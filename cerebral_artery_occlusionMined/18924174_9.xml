<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cellular therapy is potently neuroprotective and antiinflammatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the effect of HUCBC treatment on white matter injury and oligodendrocyte survival in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of 10(6) HUCBCs 48 hr poststroke reduced the amount of white matter damage in vivo as seen by quantification of myelin basic protein staining in tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether HUCBC treatment was protective via direct effects on oligodendrocytes, cultured oligodendrocytes were studied in an in vitro model of oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active caspase 3 immunohistochemistry and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase assay for cytotoxicity were used to determine that HUCBCs provide protection to oligodendrocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it is likely that HUCBC administration directly protects oligodendrocytes and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is likely to contribute to the increased behavioral recovery observed with HUCBC therapy </plain></SENT>
