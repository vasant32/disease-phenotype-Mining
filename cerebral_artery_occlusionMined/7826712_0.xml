<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since there is no established treatment for hypoperfusion, however we decided to explore the morphological cause of post-ischemic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the capillaries in ischemic/reperfused neocortex induced by 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by either 3 or 24 hours of reperfusion in 14 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic hypoperfusion was confirmed by measuring regional blood flow through a cranial window just above the left ectosylvian gyrus, which has poor anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater number of endothelial microvilli and capillary endothelial cell swelling were detected in the ischemic/reperfused neocortex, when compared with contralateral control neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially after 24-hour reperfusion, collapse of some capillaries was observed with severe perivascular glial swelling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of PMN leukocytes to the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings yielded the following statistically significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1) The number of endothelial microvilli in the ischemic/reperfused neocortex (mean +/- SD/1 blood vessel = 6.58 +/- 4.32) was significantly greater than in the control neocortex (3.13 +/- 2.68, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2) The ratio of capillary inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) in the ischemic/reperfused neocortex (ID/OD%, mean +/- SD = 75.4 +/- 16.7) was significantly smaller than in the control neocortex (89.2 +/- 10.8, p = 0.0001), indicating endothelial cell swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that these ultrastructural changes might be the cause of the multifactorial development of post-ischemic hypoperfusion, and that especially the number of endothelial microvilli and the endothelial cell swelling ratio might serve as morphological indicators of therapeutic efficacy for reperfusion injury in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
