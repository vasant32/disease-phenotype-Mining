<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, plasma perfusion was investigated in rats during 2 to 168 hours of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perfused capillaries were detected in brain cryosections by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> after 10 minutes of circulation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of capillary perfusion was identified by Evans blue (EB), which circulated for 3 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this setting, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of intracapillary EB concentrations reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in capillary flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CBF was quantified by simultaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When moving from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow to low-flow areas in the ischemic hemisphere, three states of capillary filling could be distinguished: state 1--fast perfusion, filling by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and EB (CBF 0.33 mL x g(-1) x min(-1)); state 2--delayed perfusion, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> filling (CBF 0.104 mL x g(-1) x min(-1)); state 3--minimal perfusion, no dye filling (CBF 0.056 mL x g(-1) x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In tissue of state 1 at the borderline to ischemic tissue, a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of intracapillary EB concentration (85.7%) was found than in the contralateral nonischemic hemisphere (76.4%) (P &lt; 0.05), indicating a compromised microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjacent ischemic areas were filled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (state 2) 2 to 4 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, indicating a maintained, although slow, perfusion at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Later, minimal perfused areas (state 3) progressively replaced the delayed perfused areas (state 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows, for the first time, the evolution of microvascular disturbances in relation to CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the low-flow areas, an early residual plasma perfusion is later followed by a lack of perfusion or minimal perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In areas of higher, although reduced flow at the border between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic tissue, an extreme capillary perfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> indicates permanent microcirculatory abnormalities </plain></SENT>
