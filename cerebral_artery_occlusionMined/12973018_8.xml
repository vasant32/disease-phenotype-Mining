<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of observations that cultured neurons from mice deficient in the transcription factor E2F1 exhibit resistance after treatment with a wide variety of cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inducers, the authors investigated whether resistance extended to a cerebral ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No differences in cerebral blood flow or physiologic parameters were observed in the mutant E2F1 littermates after the focal ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 1 day of reperfusion, a 33% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.05) was observed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining in the brains of E2F1-null mice compared with their E2F1+/+ and +/- littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A milder ischemic insult produced by 20 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 7 days of reperfusion produced a greater difference in the E2F1-null animals with a 71% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.001) compared to littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease in neuronal damage after mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in E2F1-null mice was observed by immunohistochemical monitoring of the loss in neuronal-specific microtubule-associated protein 2 cytoskeletal protein and the appearance of nuclear DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16450">2'-deoxyuridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This decreased brain damage was evidenced by improved behavior in motor function of E2F1 -/- mice compared with their E2F1 +/+ littermates by 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an effort to address the underlying molecular mechanism of the resistance of E2F1-null mice, the expression of several downstream proapoptotic target genes (p73, Apaf1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Arf</z:e>) of the E2F1 transcription factor was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although an attenuated increase in Hsp68 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in E2F1 -/- mice, no changes in the proapoptotic transcripts were found after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and a mechanistic inference was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the transcription factor E2F1 does modulate neuronal viability in brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and corroborates the findings with cultured neurons </plain></SENT>
