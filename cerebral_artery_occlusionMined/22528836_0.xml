<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined by Western blotting the expression of RAGE isoforms in the cerebral cortex and striatum of Wistar rats subjected to transient (1 or 2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings show that the full-length RAGE (~50 kDa) and its isoforms in the 26-43 kDa range are significantly decreased in the ischemic cortex, but not in the striatum, after 1 and 2 h tMCAo when compared to the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in the striatum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury caused a significant increase of full-length RAGE and its isoforms in the 72-100 kDa range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the soluble form of RAGE, which was significantly decreased in the plasma of rats subjected to transient or permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that regional brain expression of RAGE is differentially affected by tMCAo in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These modifications are accompanied by a decrease in the plasma levels of soluble RAGE, thereby suggesting a potential role for soluble RAGE as a peripheral biomarker of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
