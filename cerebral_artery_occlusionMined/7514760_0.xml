<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of exogenous 45Ca in the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rat model (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) was studied using 45Ca autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High 45Ca accumulations were observed in the frontal cortex and caudate-putamen corresponding with morphological damage shown by HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional 45Ca concentrations were calculated from the optical density on the 45Ca autoradiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rapid uptake of 45Ca in the ischemic brain occurred during the first 5 hours, and continued more slowly between 5 and 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of 45Ca accumulation was also expanded between 5 and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An area of low 45Ca concentration around the area of high accumulation developed 5 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which presumably accumulated 45Ca between 5 and 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lower concentration of 45Ca in the periphery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may result from: 1) a decrease in the total amount of calcium due to narrowing of extracellular space accompanied by cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and 2) delayed accumulation of exogenous 45Ca due to reduced clearance of extracellular fluid </plain></SENT>
