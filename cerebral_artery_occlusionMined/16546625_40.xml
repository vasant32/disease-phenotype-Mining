<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the effects of postinjury administration of allopregnanolone, a metabolite of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>, to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> in an animal model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in age-matched, adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats by using an intraluminal filament and suture method to occlude the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 120 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor cerebral blood flow for the entire 2-hour period of occlusion and for 5 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> received injections of allopregnanolone (8 mg/kg, n=6), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg, n=6) and vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, n=7) at 2 hours (intraperitoneally 5 minutes before reperfusion) and 6 hours (subcutaneously) postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed at 72 hours post-middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, sectioned into coronal slices, and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a blinded analysis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated by using computer-aided morphometry to measure brain areas not stained with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> or allopregnanolone treatment, stained sections revealed a significant reduction in cortical, caudate-putamen, and hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (percentage of contralateral structure) compared with vehicle-injected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction (percentage of contralateral cortex) was 37.47%+/-10.57% (vehicle), 25.49%+/-7.38% (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>; P&lt;.05 from vehicle), and 11.40%+/-7.09% (allopregnanolone; P&lt;.05 from vehicle; P&lt;.05 from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caudate-putamen infarction (percentage of contralateral caudate-putamen) was 78.02%+/-22.81% (vehicle), 48.41%+/-22.44% (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>; P&lt;.05 from vehicle), and 50.44%+/-10.90% (allopregnanolone; P&lt;.05 from vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total hemispheric infarction (percentage of contralateral hemisphere) was 24.37%+/-6.69% (vehicle), 15.95%+/-3.59% (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>; P&lt;.05 from vehicle), and 11.54%+/-3.71% (allopregnanolone; P&lt;.05 from vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in cerebral blood flow between groups and time points during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and early reperfusion were observed, suggesting that the relative ischemic insult was equivalent among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> and allopregnanolone are effective in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pathology, allopregnanolone is more potent than <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> in attenuating cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that both neurosteroids should be examined for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
