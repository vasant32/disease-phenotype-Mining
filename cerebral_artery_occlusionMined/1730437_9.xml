<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two doses (0.5 and 5 mg/kg) administered before the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MK-801 significantly reduced the neocortical volume of infarction (by about 32% at both doses) in Fischer-344 rats and had no neuroprotective effects in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MK-801 had no significant influence on either cortical or striatal infarcted volume in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction or lack of MK-801-induced neuroprotection in spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with Fischer-344 rats, could be attributed to a reduced collateral supply in the marginal area due to difference in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the pial anastomoses and/or in the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and treatment on arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results may have major clinical implications since a great proportion of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
