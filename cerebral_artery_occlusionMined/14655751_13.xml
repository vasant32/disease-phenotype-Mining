<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using autoradiography we found an increase in the density of [3H]PK11195 binding sites--likely reflecting microglial activation--in the lesion border at 3 days and in the whole striatum from 10 days to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a distinct loss of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> and [3H]CGP39653 binding sites from 10 days up to 6 weeks reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patch and matrix compartments were involved in ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the numbers of cholinergic, GABAergic, and somatostatin-containing interneurons in the ischemic striatum were not different from those in the contralateral hemisphere at 3 and 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A low density of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors, the ability to sequester calcium by calcium-binding proteins and other hitherto unidentified factors may explain this relative resistance of interneurons to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
