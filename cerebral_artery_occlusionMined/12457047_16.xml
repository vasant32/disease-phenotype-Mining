<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the impressive increased understanding of the ischemic brain damage in general, the study of effects on different age groups, young versus old, using comparable ischemic insults is clearly lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mortality rate and neurological outcome among young and old rats, through a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three old (22-24 months of age) and 16 young (3-4 months of age) male rats underwent a MCAO procedure for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surviving rats were randomly assigned to the 24-hour or 28-day resting group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate and neurological outcome in different recovery time periods were determined for comparison between the young and old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mortality rate in old rats (43.5%) was significantly higher than that of the young rats (6.3%) (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume for the 24-hour post-MCAO was 181.86 +/- 11.87 mm(3) for the young rats, and 204.64 +/- 27.18 mm(3) for the old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 28-day post-MCAO, the value was 91.16 +/- 3.59 mm(3) for the young rats, and 103.38 +/- 26.43 mm(3) for the old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is noted in both young (p &lt; 0.01) and old (p &lt; 0.05) rats after 28 days of recovery compared to that after 24 h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no meaningful difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between the young and old rats measured at 24 h or 28 days after the ischemic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The right volume was larger than the left volume at 24 h post-MCAO for both the young and the old rats, whereas the quotient approached unity for the young rats at 28 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the old rats, the quotient was negative at 28 days post-MCAO, representing the ipsilateral hemisphere was smaller than the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mortality risk to ischemic damage is greater for old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If an old rat survives the high-risk mortality in a short period after the MCAO procedure, the recovery would be of no difference to that of a young rat </plain></SENT>
