<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both SHR/Izm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone SHR/Izm (SHRSP/Izm) are commercially available, and recent progress in genetic studies allowed us to use several congenic strains of rats constructed with SHR/Izm and SHRSP/Izm as the genetic background strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 166 male SHR/Izm and 17 male SHRSP/Izm were subjected to photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion with or without YAG laser-induced reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 or 48 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in the permanent occlusion and 2-h occlusion groups (88 ± 22 [SD] and 87 ± 25 mm³, respectively) were significantly larger than that in the 1-h occlusion group (45 ± 14 mm³), indicating the presence of sizeable zone of penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size in SHRSP/Izm determined at 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was fairly large (124.0 ± 34.8 mm³, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in SHR/Izm with simple distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was 76 ± 19 mm³, which was significantly smaller than 95 ± 22 mm³ in the other SHR/Izm with more branching <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in SHR/Izm is useful in the preclinical testing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies and elucidating the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
