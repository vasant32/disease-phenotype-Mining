<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were assigned to treatment with rNIF and vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 hours was induced by insertion of an intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of the drug was initiated at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were measured within the ischemic tissue by myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rNIF resulted in a 48% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> compared with control animals (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic brains of rNIF-treated rats was reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.01) compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of neutrophils within the infarcted tissue correlated positively with the size of the area of infarction (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.6) within representative cerebral coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a significant neuroprotective effect of rNIF with continuous treatment for 48 hours following 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect was correlated with a reduced number of neutrophils within the ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate potential therapeutic properties of rNIF in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
