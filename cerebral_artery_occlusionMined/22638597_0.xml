<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>) is the key process in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The JNK pathway is also involved in the process of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We established a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in rats; detected the changes in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), GADD153 and caspase-12 at different reperfusion time points by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and double-label immunofluorescence; and observed the effect of JNK inhibitor SP600125 on the expression of JNK, GADD153 and caspase-12 to explore the relationship between the endoplasmic reticulum road and JNK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of the two hallmarks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>-GADD153 and caspase-12-significantly increased, and the activation of JNK also obviously increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After interference by SP600125, the expression of p-JNk and caspase-12 obviously decreased, whereas the decrease of GADD153 occurred only after 24Â h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> and JNK pathways are involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The JNK pathway may be involved in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>, but perhaps has more effect on the caspase-12 pathway </plain></SENT>
