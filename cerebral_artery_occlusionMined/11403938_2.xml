<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions for CREB was observed at 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NS-7 (0.5mg/kg), when injected at 6h after MCAO, significantly reversed the decreased expression for CREB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was also significantly enhanced by NS-7 in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded but not in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for interluekin-6 and inducible-type nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase were markedly induced in the cerebral cortex of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats, which was not significantly reversed by NS-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that the reversal of decrease in CREB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and concomitant increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for bFGF may contribute to the neuroprotective action of NS-7 </plain></SENT>
