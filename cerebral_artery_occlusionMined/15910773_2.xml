<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent experimental studies, a selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of endothelin ET(A) receptors, SB 234551, improved neurological and histological outcome in both head trauma and transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to ascertain the degree to which hemodynamic alterations are responsible for this therapeutic effect in a model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent MCAo by insertion of an intraluminal nylon suture coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The agent (SB 234551, 30 microg/kg/min = 1.8 mg/kg/h) or vehicle (PBS; 0.6 ml/h) was administered by i.v. infusion beginning 15 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo and lasting for 23.75 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was performed at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological data were similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SB 234551 augmented perfusion by 1.7- to 1.8-fold in both the ischemic hemisphere and in the contralateral (non-ischemic) hemisphere when compared to vehicle-treated ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic hemisphere, the brain regions significantly benefited were those lying outside the zone of most dense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (i.e., paramedian cortex and thalamus), while in the non-ischemic hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions measured showed significant lCBF augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that SB 234551 therapy results in significant improvement of local cerebral perfusion in the ischemic as well as in the non-ischemic hemispheres after permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
