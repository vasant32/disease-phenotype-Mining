<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One month after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 23 rats were unable and 7 rats were able to solve a radial 8-arm maze task during a 1-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three months after occlusion, 19 MCA-occluded rats failed to solve the task successfully again during at least a 1-month period (the cognitively impaired rats), and 11 MCA-occluded rats were able to solve it (the cognitively unimpaired rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When a delay of 60 min was imposed for this task, five cognitively unimpaired rats failed to solve it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The locomotor activity of the cognitively impaired rats increased significantly 2 months after occlusion, and this increase showed good correlation with spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the mean time a rat spent at each arm remained unchanged among the cognitively impaired, unimpaired, and sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the ratio between the cognitively impaired and unimpaired rats for disturbed motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is capable of producing long-term spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbance</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> does not seem to be primarily due to hypermotility or a disturbance in motor coordination </plain></SENT>
