<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim is to investigate the effects of neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta) on expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in brain tissue in rats following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty adult healthy male Wistar rats were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of them were randomized into a sham-operation group (n = 10) and the rest suffered surgery operation of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion with intraluminal monofilament suture from the left external-internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, 100 rats of successful models were randomly divided into a control group (n = 50) and a treatment group (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats in the treatment group were injected 1.5% NRG-1beta at a dosage of 0.3 microg/kg from the stump of the left external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of MMP-9 and NSE proteins were determined by immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent double labeling, and Western blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion induced morphological changes of brain tissue, including neurocyte shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclei fragment, and gliacyte and endothelial cell swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NRG-1beta obviously reduced and delayed the cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the expression of MMP-9 gradually increased in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NRG-1beta decreased the level of MMP-9 compared with that in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NSE immunoreaction transiently elevated at the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> insult, and then gradually decreased in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The administration of NRG-1beta significantly increased the level of NSE, and thus delayed the time and the degree of neuron damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were statistical differences in contrast to the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the expressions of the two proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 might aim at various target cells at different stages and contribute to the inflammatory reaction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NRG-1beta inhibits the activation of MMP-9 and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, enhances the activity of NSE, improves the microenvironment of neuron survivals, and delays the phase of irreversible neuron <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NRG-1beta may play a neuroprotective role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
