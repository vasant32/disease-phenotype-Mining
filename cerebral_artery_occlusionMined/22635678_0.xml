<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their functional significance remains understudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a novel role of PR as crucial mediators of neuroprotection using a model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and PR knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we observed a rapid increase in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> and 5α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28453">dihydroprogesterone</z:chebi>, the endogenous PR ligands, a process that may be a part of the natural neuroprotective mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PR deficiency, and even haploinsufficiency, increases the susceptibility of the brain to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within a time window of 24 h, PR-dependent signaling of endogenous brain <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> limits the extent of tissue damage and the impairment of motor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longer-term improvement requires additional treatment with exogenous <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> and is also PR dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potent and selective PR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Nestorone is also effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>, levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, which modulates γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, did not increase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but its administration protected both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and PR-deficient mice against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that 1) PR are linked to signaling pathways that influence susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 2) PR are direct key targets for both endogenous neuroprotection and for therapeutic strategies after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and they suggest a novel indication for synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> already validated for contraception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although allopregnanolone may not be an endogenous neuroprotective agent, its administration protects the brain against ischemic damage by signaling mechanisms not involving PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data clarify the relative roles of PR and allopregnanolone in neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
