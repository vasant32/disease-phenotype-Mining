<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accumulated research has shown that the older adult brain is significantly more vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than the young adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent evidence in young adult rats demonstrates that single-whisker stimulation can result in complete protection from ischemic damage after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), it remains unclear whether the same treatment would be effective in older animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Aged rats (21 to 24 months of age) underwent pMCAO and subsequently were divided into "treated" and "untreated" groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated aged rats received intermittent single-whisker stimulation during a 120-minute period immediately after pMCAO, whereas untreated aged rats did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These animals were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests 1 week before and 1 week after pMCAO, after which their brains were stained for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional treated aged group and a treated young adult group also were imaged with functional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that the recovery of treated aged animals was indistinguishable from that of the treated young adult animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treated aged rats had fully intact sensorimotor behavior and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, whereas untreated aged rats were impaired and sustained cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results confirm that single-whisker stimulation is protective in an aged rodent pMCAO model, despite age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings further suggest potential for translation to the more clinically relevant older adult human population </plain></SENT>
