<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The potent final sigma(1)-receptor ligand 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1-(4-phenylbutyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidine</z:chebi> (PPBP) provides neuroprotection in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that PPBP attenuates striatal tissue damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by a mechanism involving reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined whether the agent fails to protect ischemic brain when neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) is genetically deleted or pharmacologically inhibited (selective nNOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole [7-NI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO by the intraluminal filament occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> physiological variables were controlled during the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo striatal NO production was estimated via microdialysis by quantification of local, labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> recovery after labeled arginine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments, nNOS null mutants (nNOSKOs) and the genetically matched <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) strain were treated with 90 minutes of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested at 22 hours of reperfusion for measurement of infarction volume by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PPBP attenuated infarction volume at 22 hours of reperfusion in cerebral cortex and striatum and markedly attenuated NO production in ischemic and nonischemic striatum during occlusion and early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 7-NI mimicked the effects of PPBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In WT mice, infarction volume was robustly decreased by both PPBP and 7-NI, but the efficacy of PPBP was not altered by pharmacological nNOS inhibition in combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PPBP did not decrease infarction volume in nNOSKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the mechanism of neuroprotection of PPBP in vivo is through attenuation of nNOS activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-evoked NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of PPBP are lost when nNOS is not present or is inhibited; therefore, PPBP likely acts upstream from NO generation and its subsequent neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
