<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In in vivo study, inhibition of PARP activity by cilostazol prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly reduced in the rats that received cilostazol (30 mg/kg, twice orally) with improvement of neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cilostazol treatment significantly decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL)- and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>)-positive cells associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor (AIF) translocation to the nucleus in the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, cilostazol significantly reduced myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In line with these findings, the OX-42- (a marker of microglia) and TNF-alpha-positive cells (a marker of proapoptotic protein) were markedly increased in the vehicle samples, both of which were significantly attenuated by treatment with cilostazol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that neuroprotective potentials of cilostazol against focal cerebral ischemic injury are, at least in part, ascribed to its anti-inflammatory effects and PARP inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
