<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NC were infused intracerebroventricularly 4 h or 7 d after 30 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ischemic mice receiving cells at 4 h, impairment of open field performance was significantly improved and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> significantly reduced 7-14 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared to controls and to ischemic mice receiving cells at 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of murine foetal fibroblast in the same experimental conditions was not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of infused cell distribution revealed that they migrated from the ventricle to the parenchyma, progressively decreased in number but they were observable up to 14 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice receiving NC at 7 d and in sham-operated mice, few cells could be observed only at 24 h, indicating that the survival of these cells in brain tissue relates to the ischemic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of trophic factors such as Insulin Growth Factor-1, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A, Transforming Growth Factor-beta1, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Stromal Derived Factor-1alpha, as well as microglia/macrophage activation, increased 24 h after NC infusion in ischemic mice treated at 4 h compared to sham-operated and to mice receiving cells at 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: NC reduce functional impairment and neuronal damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence indicate that the reciprocal interaction between NC and the ischemic environment is crucial for NC protective actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these results we propose that a bystander control of the ischemic environment may be the mechanism used by NC to rapidly restore acutely injured brain function </plain></SENT>
