<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, at the early stages, the interpretation of USPIO-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal alterations remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes after intravenous USPIO injection with the histological iron and macrophage distribution during the first 24 hours in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multiparametric MRI at 7T and histological USPIO distribution were confronted from 6 to 24 hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption was assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> MRI and immunoglobulin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining was performed to depict the USPIO brain distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>USPIO uptake by phagocytes was assessed by immunochemistry on brain tissue, peripheral blood cells, and monocyte cells derived from bone marrow culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After USPIO injection, 4 areas of early signal change were observed on every MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these areas, iron particles were mostly free whether detected in the vascular and cerebrospinal fluid compartments or in the interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the first 24 hours, USPIO-loaded cells were not detected in the blood of injured mice or in cultured monocytic cells incubated with USPIO at plasmatic concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in this model, early reproducible USPIO-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes are mainly caused by passive diffusion of free USPIO after blood-brain barrier leakage and by intravascular trapping rather than by peripheral phagocyte infiltration </plain></SENT>
