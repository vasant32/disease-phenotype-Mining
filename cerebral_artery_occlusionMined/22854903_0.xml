<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Adult C57BL/6 mice (n = 67) were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-control (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (0.3 mg/kg), sildenafil (0.3 mg/kg), or combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (0.3 mg/kg) and sildenafil (0.3 mg/kg) were administrated via oral gavage daily for 6 days starting 24 hrs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral studies including neurologic score and adhesive removal test were performed before surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 7; cylinder test was performed before surgery and on postoperative day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were killed after 7 days and brain slices were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin to measure the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination group performed significantly better in the adhesive removal test (mean ± SD) (50 ± 54 secs) as compared with the control group (147 ± 109 secs) (P &lt; 0.05) and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (144 ± 102 secs) (P &lt; 0.05) but did not show statistically significant improvement as compared with sildenafil (107 ± 115 secs) (P = 0.148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the groups in neurologic score and cylinder test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and sildenafil generates a better functional outcome as compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-only treatment, but not sildenafil-only treatment, in one of multiple variables tested </plain></SENT>
