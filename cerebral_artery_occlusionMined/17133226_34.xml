<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The classic definition of the ischemic penumbra is a hypoperfused region in which metabolism is impaired, but still sufficient to maintain cellular polarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI (PWI, DWI) can identify regions of reduced perfusion and cellular depolarization, respectively, but it often remains unclear whether a PWI-DWI mismatch corresponds to benign oligemia or a true penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that pH-weighted MRI (pHWI) can subdivide the PWI-DWI mismatch into these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and ischemic evolution over the first 3.5 h post-occlusion was studied using multiparametric MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>End point was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> area defined by T(2)-hyperintensity at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, areas of reduced pH were always larger than or equal to DWI deficits and smaller than or equal to PWI deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group analysis showed that pHWI deficits during this phase coincided with the resulting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were smaller than PWI deficits (range 65% to 90%, depending on the severity of the occlusion) and much larger than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the outer boundary of the hypoperfused area showing a decrease in pH without DWI abnormality may correspond to the outer boundary of the ischemic penumbra, while the hypoperfused region at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH may correspond to benign oligemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These first results show that pHWI can provide information complementary to PWI and DWI in the delineation of ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
