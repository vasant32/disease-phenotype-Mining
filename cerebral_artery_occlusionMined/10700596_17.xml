<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that activated neutrophils are involved in the development of cerebral damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated neutrophils release a lot of mediators including toxic oxygen metabolites, elastase and cytokines which damage brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated roles of neutrophil elastase in the development of cerebral damage using an elastase inhibitor, ONO-5046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induced by photochemical reaction between green light and the photosensitizer dye, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photochemical reaction causes endothelial injury followed by formation of a platelet and fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the site of the irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Photochemical reaction is routinely used in our laboratory to produce <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the size of cerebral damage was measured by histochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Water content in the brain was measured and neuronal deficits were examined 24 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ONO-5046 was administered at various doses as continuous infusion for 24 h, starting just after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion or from 3 h after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ONO-5046 at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg/h significantly (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) reduced the size of cerebral damage and water content (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, respectively) in different eight rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, ONO-5046 at a dose of 30 mg/kg/h significantly (p=0.01) improved neuronal deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ONO-5046 which was administered starting from 3 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, also reduced the size of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> by anti-neutrophil antibody injection significantly (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>01) reduced the size of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Elastase released from activated neutrophils may play a key role in the development of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
