<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may be one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanisms of this injury process are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on the involvement of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (SGLT), which transports <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> ions, and generates inward currents while transporting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into cells, resulting in depolarization and increased excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of the SGLT in the development of cerebral ischemic stress-induced neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male ddY mice were subjected to 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) was measured using the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> pilot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was estimated by histological and behavioral analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">Phlorizin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> (40, 120 or 200mg/kg, i.p.) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the elevation of FBG and ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> (10 or 40μg/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed ischemic neuronal damage without reducing the elevation of FBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the development of neuronal damage was significantly and dose-dependently exacerbated following i.c.v. administration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (10% or 25% (w/v)), and its exacerbation was suppressed by i.c.v. administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> (40μg/mouse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cerebral SGLT is activated by post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and may be involved in the exacerbation of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
