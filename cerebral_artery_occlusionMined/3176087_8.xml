<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We attempted to ameliorate postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and brain tissue injury in cats by administering aminophylline to reduce the reactive hyperemia that supposedly aggravates both these sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one cats were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were killed after 3 hours, 3 days, or 14 days of recirculation; one half of the cats received 0.916 ml/kg of a 25 mg/ml solution of aminophylline by infusion at a constant rate via the femoral vein starting 10 minutes before release of the occlusion and continuing for 5 minutes after initiation of recirculation; the other half received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by the hydrogen clearance method and water content was evaluated by specific gravity measurements after 3 hours of recirculation; the status of the blood-brain barrier was assessed with Evans blue tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic observations were carried out in cats killed after 3 or 14 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aminophylline-treated cats killed after 3 hours of recirculation showed significantly reduced hyperemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and no leakage of Evans blue, which was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated cats killed after 3 hours or 3 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologic observations revealed conspicuously more severe ischemic brain tissue damage in the untreated than in the aminophylline-treated cats after 3 and 14 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate the beneficial effect of administration of aminophylline in the amelioration of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and brain tissue injury, which is presumably achieved by reduction of reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
