<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occludin and claudins are recently described tight junction proteins (TJPs) that form the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was because of the degradation of TJPs by the MMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats had a 90 mins middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion for 2, 3, or 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases were measured by immunohistochemistry and in situ and gel zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measured <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of MMP-2 and -9, furin, membrane-type MMP (MT1-MMP), occludin, and claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in the piriform cortex after 3 h of reperfusion, and an MMP inhibitor, BB-1101 (30 mg/kg), prevented the opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 h, in situ zymograms showed gelatinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Zymography and PCR showed greater increases in MMP-2 than in MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunohistochemistry for MT1-MMP and furin, which activate MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Claudin-5 and occludin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression decreased at 2 h in both hemispheres with fragments of both proteins seen on Western blot by 3 h on the ischemic side; treatment with BB-1101 reversed the degradation of the TJPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry at 3 h showed fragmented TJPs within the endothelial cell clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By 24 h, in situ zymography showed gelatinase activity and gel zymography showed elevated levels of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Disrupted TJPs previously seen in endothelial cells appeared in the surrounding astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results provide direct evidence that MMPs open the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> by degrading TJPs and that an MMP inhibitor prevents degradation of the TJPs by MMPs </plain></SENT>
