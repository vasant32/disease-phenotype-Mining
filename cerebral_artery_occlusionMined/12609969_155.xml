<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that intravenous infusion of human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>hMSCs (1x10(6)) were intravenously injected into rats 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), immunohistochemistry and ELISA were performed to assay <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and levels of human and rat VEGF in the host brain, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, capillary-like tube formation was measured using mouse brain-derived endothelial cells (MBDECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological and three dimensional image analyses revealed significant (P&lt;0.05) increases in numbers of enlarged and thin walled blood vessels and numbers of newly formed capillaries at the boundary of the ischemic lesion in rats (n=12) treated with hMSCs compared with numbers in rats (n=12) treated with PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ELISA measurements showed that treatment with hMSCs significantly (P&lt;0.05) raised endogenous rat VEGF levels in the IBZ from 10.5+/-1.7 ng/mL in the control group to 17.5+/-1.6 ng/mL in the hMSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with hMSCs increased endogenous VEGFR2 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, when MBDECs were incubated with the supernatant obtained from cultured hMSCs, capillary-like tube formation was significantly (P&lt;0.01) induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, hMSC-induced capillary-like tube formation was significantly (P&lt;0.01) inhibited when the endothelial cells were incubated with the supernatant from hMSCs in the presence of a neutralizing anti-VEGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with hMSCs enhances <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the host brain and hMSC-<z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> is mediated by increases in levels of endogenous rat VEGF and VEGFR2 </plain></SENT>
