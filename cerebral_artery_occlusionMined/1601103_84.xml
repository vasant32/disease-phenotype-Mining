<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has become increasingly clear that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion usually consists of a densely ischemic focus and of perifocal areas with better upheld flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least in rats and cats, some of these perifocal ("penumbral") areas subsequently become recruited in the infarction process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms may involve an aberrant cellular calcium metabolism and enhanced production of free radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, though, the metabolic perturbation in the penumbra requires better characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this article was to define flow distribution in a rat model of reversible middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, so as to allow delineation of the metabolic aberrations responsible for the subsequent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We modified the intraluminal filament occlusion model recently developed by Koizumi et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(1986), and described in more detail by Nagasawa and Kogure (1989), adopting it for use in both spontaneously breathing and artificially ventilated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (achieved in about 9/10 rats) was judged by unilateral EEG <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in ventilated rats, and neurological deficits, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp>, in spontaneously breathing ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere was reduced to nearly constant values after 20, 60, and 120 min of occlusion, flow rates in the focus being about 10% and in the perifocal ipsilateral areas about 15-20% of control (contralateral side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the filament was left in place (permanent occlusion) 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and histopathology after 24 h showed a massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the occluded side, extending from caudoputamen and overlaying cortex to the occipital striate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals recirculated after 60 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and allowed to survive 7 days for histopathology, showed infarction of the caudoputamen (lateral part or whole nucleus) in 5/6 animals and selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in one animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neocortex showed either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, or no damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was some overlap between neocortical areas which were infarcted and those which were salvaged by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In general, though, both the CBF data and the recovery studies with a histopathological endpoint define large parts of the neocortex as perifocal (penumbral) areas which lend themselves to studies of metabolic events leading to infarction </plain></SENT>
