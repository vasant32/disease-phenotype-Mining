<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High speed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and short diffusion times are used to investigate the appearance of restricted diffusion in three different models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The models are: the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in the rat, the carotid occlusion model in the gerbil, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> microvascular occlusion model in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three were investigated for 16 b-values equally spaced between 10 and 1510 s/mm2 using two distinct experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ct (constant time) experiment, the diffusion time was held constant at 11.7 ms while the b-value was varied with the gradient strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cg (constant gradient) experiment, the gradient strength was held constant and the b-value increased by varying the diffusion time from 4.4 to 11.7 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A monoexponential decay of the signal intensity with b-value in the ct experiment accompanied by nonmonoexponential (NME) decay in the cg experiment is indicative of restricted diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As this phenomenon is detectable only at short diffusion times, it cannot be due to restriction by impermeable membranes, and we have thus termed this apparent restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the MCAO model and the carotid occlusion model, apparent restriction was found both inside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> territory and in some regions outside it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No definite evidence for restriction was found for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> model, which was, however, only studied from 24 h post-insult </plain></SENT>
