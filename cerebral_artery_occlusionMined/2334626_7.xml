<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effect of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> on reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were anaesthetized with 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was performed during four conditions: normotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) 107 (SD 15) mm Hg); hypovolaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (blood withdrawn to reduce MAP to 43 (2) mm Hg); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP reduced to 45 (3) mm Hg); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP reduced to 44 (3) mm Hg with 3.5 (0.48)% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> was established before MCAO and was maintained for 10 min, at which time the dimension of the brain areas with zero CBF was determined autoradiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hypotensive regimens were associated with significantly larger areas of extreme CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a coronal section at the centre of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution, the area with zero CBF (expressed as a percentage of the area of the entire coronal section) was: normotension 4.7 (4.5)%; hypovolaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> 10.1 (2.8)%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> 13.5 (2.0)%; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> 11.8 (3.9)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the three hypotensive regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that, when focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> occurs during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP 45 mm Hg) induced by any of the three regimens evaluated, extreme CBF reduction occurs over larger areas than are observed during normotension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the importance of arterial pressure as a determinant of collateral flow during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
