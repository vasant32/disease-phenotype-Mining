<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) inactivation protects against brain injury caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in various animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect A(2A)R genetic inactivation on extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the striatum and its relationship to the neuroprotection afforded by A(2A)R inactivation following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the striatum was collected by in vivo microdialysis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and after reperfusion, and then determined with high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level was indistinguishable between A(2A)R knock-out (A(2A)R-KO) mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (A(2A)R-WT) littermates before MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After MCAo a remarkable increase in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level was observed in the A(2A)R-WT mice, but the increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level was significantly attenuated in the A(2A)R-KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral reperfusion induced a second wave of increase of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level in the A(2A)R-WT mice, and again this increase was largely attenuated in the A(2A)R-KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlating with attenuated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level, the neurological deficits and the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were also significantly reduced in the A(2A)R-KO mice compared with their WT littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the genetic inactivation of A(2A)R inhibits the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> outflow and ameliorates the brain injury in both ischemic and reperfusion phases in the transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the protection of A(2A)R inactivation against ischemic brain injury is associated with the suppression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-dependent toxicity </plain></SENT>
