<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells from autologous bone marrow were transfected with the LacZ reporter gene, and injected intravenously into rats at 3-72 h after induction of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis of the ischemic lesion at 14 days after transplantation revealed reduced ischemic lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was 250+/-45 mm(3) (n=6) after MCAO without cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions were minimally detected by absence of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining when bone marrow cells were infused 3 h after lesion induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were clearly detected beginning with the 6-h postlesion group and became progressively larger at 12, 24 and 72 h (80+/-25, 140+/-18, and 180+/-22 mm(3), respectively; n=6 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplanted LacZ(+) bone marrow cells accumulated extensively in and around the ischemic lesions, and immunohistochemistry suggests some neuronal and glial lineage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing (<z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and Treadmill stress test) indicated greater functional recovery in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that early intervention with intravenous administration of autologous mononuclear cells from bone marrow can reduce lesion size in the MCAO model in the rat, and improve functional outcome </plain></SENT>
