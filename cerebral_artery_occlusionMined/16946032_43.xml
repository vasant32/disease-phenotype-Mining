<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> deacetylases (HDACs) play a central role in epigenetic regulation of transcription, and inhibitors of HDACs are emerging as neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> (SAHA) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation in control and ischemic mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation was constitutively present at specific lysine residues in neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that in the ischemic brain tissue subjected to 6 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation levels drastically decreased, without evidence for a concomitant change of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-transferase or deacetylase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SAHA (50 mg/kg i.p.) increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain (of approximately 8-fold after 6 h) and prevented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylation in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were accompanied by increased expression of the neuroprotective proteins Hsp70 and Bcl-2 in both control and ischemic brain tissue 24 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that at the same time point, mice injected with SAHA at 25 and 50 mg/kg had smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared with vehicle-receiving animals (28.5% and 29.8% reduction, p &lt; 0.05 versus vehicle, Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At higher doses, SAHA was less efficient in increasing Bcl-2 and Hsp70 expression and did not afford significant ischemic neuroprotection (13.9% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of HDACs promotes expression of neuroprotective proteins within the ischemic brain and underscores the therapeutic potential of molecules inhibiting HDACs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
