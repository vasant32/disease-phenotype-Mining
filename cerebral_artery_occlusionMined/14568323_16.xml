<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental evidences indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, the final metabolite of glycolysis, has a remarkable protective effect against different types of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the neuroprotective effect and the neurological outcome after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> administration in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally 30 min after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In other set of experiments, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> was given either before, immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or in a long-term administration paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome, mortality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even when the lowest doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> reduced mortality and neurological deficits, no concomitant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> increased cortical infarction by 27% when administered 30 min after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> was given before pMCAO, a significant increase in neurological deficits was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, on the contrary of what was found in the case of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, present findings do not support a great neuroprotective role for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, suggesting two distinct mechanisms involved in the effects of this glycolytic metabolite in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
