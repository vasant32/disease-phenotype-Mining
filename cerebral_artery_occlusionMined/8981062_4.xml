<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This investigation was undertaken to study the effect of iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two adult rabbits were subjected to left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> via the transorbital route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen rabbits received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 30 micrograms/kg iloprost, 7 rabbits received an i.v. infusion of 10 micrograms/ kg, and 9 rabbits received an i.v. infusion of 20 micrograms/kg iloprost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve rabbits received an intravenous infusion of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with iloprost started immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and continued for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After killing the animals, brains were removed and five coronal slices were incubated in a 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> solution to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 30 micrograms/kg iloprost significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared with treatment with saline (3.49 +/- 2.79% vs. 9.03 +/- 4.26%, P &lt; 0.001), but the lower doses of iloprost did not have a beneficial effect on the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intravenous iloprost treatment after occlusion has a highly protective effect without any side effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
