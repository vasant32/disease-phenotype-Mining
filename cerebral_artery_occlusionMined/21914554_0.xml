<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several translational attempts of potential neuroprotective agents have failed, hence extended perspectives are required regarding the regional differences of neuronal impairment and glial involvement by using clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> following experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, considering tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as established treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) as potential neuroprotective co-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and underwent either treatment with tPA only, combined tPA+HBO, or no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal impairment was assessed by Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) staining in 4 ischemia-related areas and at 4 different time points after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction (24hours, 7, 14 and 28 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, spatial relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> were revealed by triple fluorescence staining of neurons, astrocytes and microglia, comparing the ipsi- and contra-lesional hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the ischemic injury in general, a shell-like distribution of neuronal damage was observed, starting in the ischemic core and diminishing over the general ischemic area to the ischemic border zone and the primary non-affected area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern remained detectable up to 4weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, tPA and tPA+HBO did not markedly affect the post-ischemic course of neuronal impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of treatment with tPA or potential neuroprotective agents on neuronal integrity, with emphasis on the separation of intact neurons from those undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
