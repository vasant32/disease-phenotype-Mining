<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the possible function of activin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury, we assessed which components of the activin signalling pathway were modulated in response to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> replacement protects against MCAO-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we explored whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> replacement influences activin gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent MCAO and the expression of activins and their corresponding receptors was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed up-regulation of activin betaA and activin type I receptor A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in response to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual-label immunocytochemistry followed by confocal z-stack analysis showed that the activin A expressing cells comprised neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, we monitored the time course of activin betaA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi>- or vehicle-treated rats at 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after MCAO via in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Starting at 4 h after injury, activin betaA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was up-regulated in cortical and striatal areas in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activin betaA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the cortex increased dramatically with time and were highest at 24 h after the insult, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> replacement did not influence this increase </plain></SENT>
