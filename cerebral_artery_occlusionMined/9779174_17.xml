<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to make this technique clinically useful for both nurses and medical staff, the ischemic threshold for brain tissue oxygen tension (brain pO2) must be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three end points were used for determination of the critical brain pO2 value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> determination after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a feline model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) Threshold analysis using the schemic threshold for cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a "gold standard" in severely head injury patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3) Outcome analysis in severely head injured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain pO2 dropped to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg and 23 +/- 6, 4 to 5 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the cat (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In severely head injured patients, a brain pO2 &lt; or = 19 mm Hg was correlated with poor outcome (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ischemic threshold for (r)CBF of 18 ml/100 g/min corresponded to a brain pO2 of 22 mm Hg, in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By using the above mentioned end points as a reference, we found the critical value for brain pO2 to be in between 19 and 23 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clearly, the difference between our threshold value and the lower critical brain pO2 level found by other groups using the Licox system, needs to be clarified in a comparison study before a uniform threshold for brain pO2 can be determined </plain></SENT>
