<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was obtained by permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after occlusion, at a time when brain water content is submaximal, blood samples were collected to measure serum osmolality, and brains were removed to measure the brain water content of two samples of frontoparietal cortical tissue corresponding to the core and the periphery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When administered from 3 to 30 mg/kg as a single i.p. injection 20 h after occlusion, niravoline significantly reduced the brain cortical water increase by 27% up to 48% in the periphery of the ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At these same doses, it increased the serum osmolality to the same extent in ischemic as in nonischemic mice: 4 to 10 mOsm/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>U 50488 generally showed a similar activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (1 or 2 g/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>23 h after occlusion) increased serum osmolality but did not decrease brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, kappa opiate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> could be an alternative to hyperosmotic agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> of the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> type, the use of which is limited to the early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
