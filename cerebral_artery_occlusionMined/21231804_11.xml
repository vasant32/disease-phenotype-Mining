<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AIMS: Transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow (BM) or adipose tissue is expected to become a cell therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study compared the therapeutic potential of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) with that of BM-derived stem cells (BMSC) in a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ASC and BMSC were isolated from age-matched C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These MSC were analyzed for growth kinetics and their capacity to secrete trophic factors and differentiate toward neural and vascular cell lineages in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo study, ASC or BMSC were administrated intravenously into recipient mice (1 Ã— 10(5) cells/mouse) soon after reperfusion following a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits, the degree of infarction, expression of factors in the brain, and the fate of the injected cells were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASC showed higher proliferative activity with greater production of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) than BMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro conditions allowed ASC to differentiate into neural, glial and vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASC administration showed remarkable attenuation of ischemic damage, although the ASC were not yet fully incorporated into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the expression of HGF and angiopoietin-1 in ischemic brain tissue was significantly increased in ASC-treated mice compared with the BMSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BMSC, ASC have great advantages for cell preparation because of easier and safer access to adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings suggest that ASC would be a more preferable source for cell therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> than BMSC </plain></SENT>
