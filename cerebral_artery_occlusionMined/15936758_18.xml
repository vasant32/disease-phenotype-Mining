<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of HSP70 overexpression is still a matter of debate, with some reports showing protection and others not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to resolve these discrepancies and further investigate the action of these proteins in vivo, transgenic mice overexpressing HSP70 have been compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, the effect of HSP70 was assessed histologically postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the mice in vivo after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume, as measured at 24 h using T(2)-weighted MRI, was significantly smaller in HSP70 transgenic mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The smaller lesion size in HSP70 transgenic mice could not be attributed to differences in vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> or in cerebral blood flow during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the apparent diffusion coefficient showed different spatial and temporal patterns between the groups, suggesting that the damage within the lesion may be less severe for HSP70 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that overexpression of HSP70 reduces the overall lesion size and may also limit the tissue damage within the lesion </plain></SENT>
