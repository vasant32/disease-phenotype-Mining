<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We explored the possibility that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) might contribute to the therapeutic effect of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative efficacy of modified NSC to promote behavioral recovery was investigated in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recombinant adenovirus (Ad-HIF-1alpha) was engineered to express HIF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control NSC infected with control adenovirus (NSC-Ad), recombinant adenovirus Ad-HIF-1alpha, or NSC infected by Ad-HIF-1alpha (NSC-Ad-HIF-1alpha), were used for intraventricular transplantion into rat brain 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed over 4 weeks using the modified neurological severity scale (NSS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term in vivo expression of HIF-1alpha was demonstrated by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry, and derivatives of nestin-positive transplanted cells contributed to both neuronal (neurofilament-positive) and astroglial (glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive) lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed functional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement was accelerated in animals receiving either NSC-Ad or Ad-HIF-1alpha, while improvement at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times between 7 days and 28 days post MCAO was significantly greater in animals transplanted with NSC-Ad-HIF-1alpha than for other treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NSC-Ad-HIF-1alpha cells also increased the number of factor VIII-positive cells in the region of ischemic injury, indicating that HIF-1alpha expression can promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene-modified NSC expressing HIF-1alpha have therapeutic potential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
