<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate potential synergistic neuroprotective effects of prolonged citicoline treatment and early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> therapy, suboptimal treatment regimens of citicoline and MK-801 were tested alone and in combination in a rat model of temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 per group) underwent 90 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with the suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly and blindly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) saline, vehicle; (2) MK-801, 0.5 mg/kg IV bolus at 60 minutes after MCAO followed by saline 1 mL/kg IP daily for 7 days; (3) saline IV at 60 minutes after MCAO followed by citicoline 250 mg/kg IP daily for 7 days; or (4) both MK-801 and citicoline (daily for 7 days) active treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was used to assess postmortem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were determined daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Premature mortality between days 2 and 4 was 33.3% in group 1, 41.7% in groups 2 and 3, and 25.0% in group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in group 4 compared with the others (175.2 +/- 89.3 mm3 in group 1, 179.1 +/- 78.5 mm3 in group 2, 163.9 +/- 73.7 mm3 in group 3, and 84.7 +/- 56.8 mm3 in group 4 [P &lt; .02, ANOVA and P &lt; .05, Scheff√©'s test for group 1 versus group 4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in animals dying prematurely was significantly (P &lt; .05, Student's t test) larger in group 1 than those surviving for 7 days (247.2 +/- 89.5 versus 139.2 +/- 68.2 mm3), but there was no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in groups 2, 3, and 4 between animals dying prematurely and those surviving for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate synergistic neuroprotective effects of citicoline and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in temporary experimental focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
