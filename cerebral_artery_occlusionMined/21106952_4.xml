<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: thrombolytic treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) improves outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who can be treated within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, delayed treatment with tPA leads to increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation and can result in enhanced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to validate a reproducible mouse model of hemorrhagic transformation associated with delayed administration of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: mice were anesthetized and thrombin was injected into the middle cerebral artery to induce the formation of a clot as described by Orset et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To induce reperfusion, tPA (10 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 20 minutes or 3 hours after thrombin injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: thrombin produced a clot in 83.1% of the animals, which caused focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> determined 24 hours after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were found in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> group, including hemorrhagic infarction type 1 (HI-1) in 46.2%, hemorrhagic infarction type 2 (HI-2) in 30.8% and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> type 1 in 23.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of tPA 20 minutes after the occlusion produced an effective reperfusion in 62.5% of the animals and reduced both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and appearance of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (10% nonhemorrhage, 80% HI-1 and 10% HI-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, administration of tPA 3 hours after the occlusion led to effective reperfusion in 47.1% of the animals, did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, caused hemorrhagic transformation (25% HI-1, 37.5% HI-2, and 37.5% parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> type 1), and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: we have set up a reproducible mouse model of hemorrhagic transformation associated with delayed administration of tPA similar to that observed in humans </plain></SENT>
