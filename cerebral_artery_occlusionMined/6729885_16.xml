<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control rats the calculated tissue pH values in gray matter were slightly lower than those in white matter, and there was no significant difference in the calculated pH among the various structures in cortical and subcortical gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hours after a left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, marked reductions in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-DMO concentrations were demonstrated in the anterior two-thirds of the cerebral cortex and in the lateral part of the caudate nucleus indicating tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although several assumptions are required for the calculation of pH in brain tissue, this method would appear very useful in the investigation of the altered metabolic state in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
