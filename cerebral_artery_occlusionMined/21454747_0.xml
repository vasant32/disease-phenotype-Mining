<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to develop a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this approach, cerebral hemodynamics prior to clipping are measured by a bolus-tracking method that uses <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> as an intravascular contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline hemodynamic measurements are then used to convert the continuous Hb difference (HbD) signal (HbD = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> - <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>) acquired during vessel occlusion to units of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To validate the approach, HbD signal changes, along with the corresponding CBF changes, were measured in pigs following occlusion of the common carotid arteries or a middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both occlusion models, the predicted CBF change derived from the HbD signal strongly correlated with the measured change in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression of the predicted and measured CBF changes resulted in a slope of 0.962 (R(2) = 0.909) following carotid occlusion and 0.939 (R(2) = 0.907) following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that calibrating the HbD signal by baseline hemodynamic measurements provides a clinically feasible method of monitoring CBF changes during neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
