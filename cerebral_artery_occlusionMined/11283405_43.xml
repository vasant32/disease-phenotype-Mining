<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test their efficacy after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, MHP36 cells were grafted 2 to 3 weeks after transient intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MHP36 cells were implanted into the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion, with 8 deposits of 3 microL of cell suspension (25 000 cells per microliter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham grafted rats received equivalent volumes of vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three groups, sham-operated controls (n=11), MCAO+sham grafts (n=10), and MCAO+MHP36 grafts (n=11), were compared in 3 behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the bilateral asymmetry test, MCAO+MHP36 grafted rats exhibited neglect before grafting but subsequently showed no significant dysfunction, whereas MCAO+sham grafted rats showed stable sensorimotor deficits over 18 weeks relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO+sham grafted rats demonstrated spontaneous motor asymmetry and increased rotational bias after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51065">dopamine agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCAO+MHP36 and control groups exhibited no bias in either spontaneous or drug-induced rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to motor recovery, MCAO+MHP36 grafted rats showed no improvement relative to MCAO+sham grafted rats in spatial learning and memory in the water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCAO produced large striatal and cortical cavitations in both occluded groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) in the MCAO+MHP36 grafted group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of MHP36 cells were identified within the intact grafted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, MHP36 cells were also seen in the cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum of the lesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MHP36 cells may improve functional outcome after MCAO by assisting spontaneous reorganization in both the damaged and intact hemispheres </plain></SENT>
