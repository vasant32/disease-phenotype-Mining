<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in adult rats rapidly and robustly induces neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) but there are few and inconsistent reports in mice, presenting a hurdle to genetically investigate the endogenous neurogenic regulators such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we first provide a platform for further studies by showing that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult male C57BL/6 mice robustly enhances neurogenesis in the SVZ only under very specific conditions, i.e., 14days after a 30min occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CNTF expression paralleled changes in the number of proliferated, BrdU-positive, SVZ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-induced proliferation was absent in CNTF-/- mice, suggesting that it is mediated by CNTF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO-increased CNTF appears to act on C cell proliferation and by inducing FGF2 expression but not via EGF expression or Notch1 signaling of neural stem cells in the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNTF is unique, as expression of other gp130 ligands, IL-6 and LIF, did not predict SVZ proliferation or showed no or only small compensatory increases in CNTF-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î±, which can inhibit neurogenesis, and the presence of leukocytes in the SVZ were inversely correlated with neurogenesis, but pro-inflammatory cytokines did not affect CNTF expression in cultured astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that slowly up-regulated CNTF in the SVZ mediates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurogenesis and is counteracted by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further pharmacological stimulation of endogenous CNTF might be a good therapeutic strategy for cell replacement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as CNTF regulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns of neurogenesis and is expressed almost exclusively in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
