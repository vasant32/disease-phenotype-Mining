<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Using a live imaging approach, we have previously shown that microglia activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is characterized by marked and long-term induction of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 biophotonic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of TLR2 (and potentially other TLRs) beyond the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> innate immune response and as early neuroprotection against ischemic injury is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TLR2-/- mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by different reperfusion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses assessing microglial activation profile/innate immune response were performed using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry analysis, flow cytometry and inflammatory cytokine array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of the TLR2 deficiency on the evolution of ischemic brain injury were analyzed using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining of brain sections with appropriate lesion size estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we report that TLR2 deficiency markedly affects post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> immune response resulting in delayed exacerbation of the ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The temporal analysis of the microglia/macrophage activation profiles in TLR2-/- mice and age-matched controls revealed reduced microglia/macrophage activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reduced capacity of resident microglia to proliferate as well as decreased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) and consequently lower levels of CD45(high)/CD11b(+) expressing cells as shown by flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions (24 to 72â€‰h) were smaller in TLR2-/- mice, the observed alterations in innate immune response were more pronounced at later time points (at day 7) after initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which finally resulted in delayed exacerbation of ischemic lesion leading to larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarctions as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results revealed that TLR2 deficiency is associated with significant decrease in the levels of neurotrophic/anti-apoptotic factor Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), expressed by microglia in the areas both in and around ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results clearly suggest that optimal and timely microglial activation/innate immune response is needed to limit neuronal damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
