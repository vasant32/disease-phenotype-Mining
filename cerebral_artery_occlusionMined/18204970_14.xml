<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi>, the yellow colouring principle in turmeric, is polyphenolic and major active constituent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides anti-inflammatory, thrombolytic and anticarcinogenic activities, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> also possesses strong <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the novel combination of properties, neuroprotective efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was studied in rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were pre-treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, po) for 5 days prior to MCAO and for another 3 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parameters studied were behavioural, biochemical and histological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> could significantly improve neurobehavioral performance compared to untreated ischemic rats as judged by its effect on rota-rod performance and grid walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant inhibition in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and an increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity in corpus striatum and cerebral cortex was observed following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in MCAO rats as compared to MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium levels were decreased following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, a reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area from 33% to 24% was observed in MCAO rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates the protective efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
