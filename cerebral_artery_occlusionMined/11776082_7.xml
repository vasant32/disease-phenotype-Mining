<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty animals underwent transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and the other thirty permanent MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly allocated to 3 sub-groups: control group (n = 10), HBO-3 group (n = 10), and HBO-5 group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals in HBO-3 and HBO-5 groups received 1 hour hyperbaric oxygenation at 2.5 atmosphere absolute (ATA) in 100% oxygen every day for 3 and 5 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals in the control group received sham treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24 hours after the last HBO, transient MCAO (120 min) and permanent MCAO were induced by introducing a 3-0 nylon monofilament suture through internal carotid artery based on the Koizumi technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was evaluated until 24 hours after reperfusion in transient MCAO rats and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in permanent MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was then assessed by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In transient MCAO rats, the neurological outcome in both the HBO-3 and HBO-5 groups was better than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05 and 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume decreased from 171.5 +/- 113 mm3 to 40.6 +/- 49.9 mm3(P &lt; 0.05) in the HBO-3 group and 16.2 +/- 28.8 mm3(P &lt; 0.01) in the HBO-5 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in neurological outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume among the three groups in permanent MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that HBO preconditioning can induce ischemic tolerance in transient not permanent MCAO rats in a "dose-dependent" manner </plain></SENT>
