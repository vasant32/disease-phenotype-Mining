<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique to directly assess the metabolic integrity of penumbral tissue following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For ischemically stressed tissue to be salvageable, it has to be capable of recovering aerobic metabolism (in place of anaerobic metabolism) on reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We probed ischemic brain tissue by altering the rate of oxygen delivery using a challenge of 100% oxygen ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any change from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism should alter the rate of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production and hence, levels of tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Series 1 (n = 6), changes in tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> during and following 100% oxygen challenge were monitored using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) were used to locate MRS voxels within the ischemic core, the homotopic contralateral striatum and within PWI/DWI mismatch (i.e. presumed penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 20  min of oxygen, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> signal change was -16.1 ± 8.8% (mean ± SD) in PWI/DWI mismatch, +2.8 ± 5.1% in the ischemic core, and -0.6 ± 7.6% in the contralateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Return to air ventilation for 20  min resulted in a reversal, with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increasing by 46 ± 25.3% in the PWI/DWI mismatch, 6.6 ± 6.2% in the ischemic core, and -5 ± 11.4% in the contralateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Series 2 (n = 6), a novel form of spectroscopic imaging was used to acquire <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> change maps to spatially identify regions of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> change within the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique has potential clinical utility by identifying tissue that displays anaerobic metabolism capable of recovering aerobic metabolism when oxygen delivery is increased, which could provide a more precise assessment of penumbra </plain></SENT>
