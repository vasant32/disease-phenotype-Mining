<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in situ hybridization technique, it was found that in the MCAO group the expression of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased at 2h, 6h, 12h after reperfusion in cerebral ischemic cortex compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In EA+ MCAO group the expression of IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly decreased at 2h, 6h and 12h in ischemic cortex compared with MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that EA might decrease the IL-1beta protein expression by reducing the IL-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
