<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group, MCAO group, Vehicle group and ADSC group (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established by MCAO with Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADSC were labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One day after MCAO, 30 microL of cell suspension containing 1 x 10(6); ADSCs were injected into the lateral ventricle of ADSC group and the same dose of PBS was given to the Vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At day 4, day 7 and day 14 after MCAO, the rats were decapitated to detect the expression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in ischaemic rat's brain by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham group, the expression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha significantly up-regulated at 4 d, 7 d of MCAO group(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference of IL-10 and TNF-alpha expression between MCAO and vehicle group ant any time point(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Vehicle group, the expression of IL-10 significantly up-regulated while TNF-alpha expression significantly decreased of ADSC-treated group at any timepoint post MCAO(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC could up-regulate the expression of IL-10 and down-regulate the expression of TNF-alpha in MCAO rat's brain, which might contribute to its protective role upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
