<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently the authors have shown that female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) in proestrus (high endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>), sustain more than 20% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) compared with SHRSPs in metestrus (low endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> has <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> properties, the authors investigated whether the estrous state influences cerebral blood flow (CBF) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured 2.5 hours after a distal MCAO by [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiography in conscious SHRSPs either in metestrus or in proestrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in CBF when analyzed either at predetermined anatomic regions or by cumulative distribution analysis of areas with flow &lt;25 mL/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a positive internal control, the authors compared results in SHRSPs with those in their normotensive reference strain, Wistar Kyoto rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SHRSPs displayed more severe and widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than Wistar Kyoto rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absence of demonstrable CBF differences between estrous states appears to be unrelated to the CBF measurement paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size afforded in proestrus in SHRSPs is unlikely to be due to an influence on CBF </plain></SENT>
