<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF is neuroprotective after experimental brain injury, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF) is a cytokine important for the survival and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its receptor (c-kit or CD117) is present in some endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether the combination of G-CSF/SCF induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system by promoting entry of endothelial precursors into the injured brain and causing them to proliferate there </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We induced permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in female mice that previously underwent sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation from enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF/SCF treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by more than 50% and resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in vessel formation in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a large percentage of which contain endothelial cells of bone marrow origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most cells entering the brain maintained their bone marrow identity and did not transdifferentiate into neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>G-CSF/SCF treatment also led to a 2-fold increase in the number of newborn cells in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that G-CSF/SCF treatment might help recovery through induction of bone marrow-derived <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, thus improving neuronal survival and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
