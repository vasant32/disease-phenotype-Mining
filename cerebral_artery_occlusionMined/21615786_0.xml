<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15) regulates various cellular processes including cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> regulates the levels of PEA-15 and the two phosphorylated forms of PEA-15 (Ser 104 and Ser 116) in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced injury model and neuronal cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) prior to MCAO, and cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PEA-15 levels after ischemic brain injury were monitored using a proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> pretreatment prevented the ischemic injury-induced reduction in PEA-15 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Western blot analysis demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> attenuated the ischemic injury-induced reduction in PEA-15, phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104), and phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 116) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> showed decreased expression of PEA-15, phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104), and phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 116), while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> pretreatment prevented the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity-induced decreases in the levels of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the levels of phospho-PEA-15 proteins indicates the inhibition of anti-apoptotic function of PEA-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, in vivo and in vitro results suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> protects neurons against ischemic injury by maintaining levels of phospho-PEA-15 proteins </plain></SENT>
