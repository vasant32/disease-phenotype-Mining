<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in reperfusion injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (FCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ROS are known to regulate the activity of transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1), which is a dimer consisting of members of the Jun and Fos families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of ROS in AP-1 activity after FCI using transgenic mice that overexpressed copper-zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD1) and that had reduced infarction volume after FCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SOD1 transgenic mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion by intraluminal suture blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mice were allowed to recover for 1, 2, and 4 hours before euthanasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein expression of c-Jun and c-Fos was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AP-1 DNA-protein binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, immunohistochemistry demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> c-Jun and c-Fos activation in ischemic cortex and its outer boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of both was reduced in SOD1 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blotting confirmed that SOD1 overexpression was associated with reduced c-Jun and c-Fos protein levels in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-enhanced DNA binding activity observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was reduced in SOD1 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Supershift assays indicated that c-Jun participated in the bound AP-1 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SOD1 overexpression prevents early activation of AP-1 after transient FCI in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may block the expression of downstream target genes that are injurious, thereby reducing the infarction volume after transient FCI in mice </plain></SENT>
