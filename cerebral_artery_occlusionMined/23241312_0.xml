<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical trial of FK506 as a neuroprotectant failed due to adverse side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This present study aimed to conduct the selective delivery of FK506 to damaged regions, while at the same time reducing the dosage of FK506, by using a liposomal drug delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, the cytoprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>-modified liposomes encapsulating FK506 (FK506-liposomes) on neuron-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> PC12 cells was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FK506-liposomes protected these cells from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced toxicity in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, we investigated the usefulness of FK506-liposomes in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FK506-liposomes accumulated in the brain parenchyma by passing through the disrupted blood-brain barrier at an early stage after reperfusion had been initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed that FK506-liposomes strongly suppressed neutrophil invasion and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, events that lead to a poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corresponding to these results, a single injection of FK506-liposomes at a low dosage significantly reduced cerebral cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and ameliorated motor function deficits in t-MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that liposomalization of FK506 could reduce the administration dose by enhancing the therapeutic efficacy; hence, FK506-liposomes should be a promising neuroprotectant after cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>.-Ishii, T., Asai, T., Oyama, D., Agato, Y., Yasuda, N., Fukuta, T., Shimizu, K., Minamino, T., Oku, N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury with PEGylated liposomes encapsulating FK506 </plain></SENT>
