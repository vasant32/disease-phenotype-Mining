<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain perfusion images of six patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> obtained before and after acupuncture and compared the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images were obtained before and after acupuncture at six traditional acupoints (LI 4, 10, 11, 15 and 16 and TE5) in the affected arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline image was subtracted from the postacupuncture image, to produce a subtraction image displaying only voxels with values &gt;2 SD from the mean and those voxels were coregistered to the baseline SPECT or T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar images were obtained before and after acupuncture of eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical parametric mapping with a threshold of P =0.001 and a corrected P of 0.05 was performed for group comparison between postacupuncture and baseline SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focally increased CBF was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients especially in the hypoperfused zone surrounding the ischaemic lesion, the ipsilateral or contralateral sensorimotor area, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> subjects showed increased rCBF mainly in the parahippocampal gyrus, premotor area, frontal and temporal areas bilaterally and ipsilateral globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture stimulation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients appears to activate perilesional or use-dependent reorganised sites and might be a way of looking at brain reorganisation </plain></SENT>
