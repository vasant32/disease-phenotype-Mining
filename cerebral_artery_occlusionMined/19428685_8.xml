<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is one of the most robust neuroprotectants clinically available, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through microarray gene expression analysis, we previously identified several key molecules potentially involved in the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in a 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rat model, including cytokine and chemokine genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that the expressions of 2 genes, macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha) and its receptor, CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6), were upregulated in the model and were suppressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of cerebral MIP-3alpha, it was administered into the rat striatum; dose- and time-dependent induction of CCR6 gene expression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-1beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha injection also induced sequential expressions of MIP-3alpha and CCR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MIP-3alpha was found to be produced by proinflammatory cytokines in rat astrocytes, while it was suppressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In turn, MIP-3alpha stimulated IL-1beta and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expressions in rat microglia and rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of an anti-rat MIP-3alpha-neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in MCAO rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MIP-3alpha plays a pivotal role in inflammatory cascades in ischemic brains, and may be a novel therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
