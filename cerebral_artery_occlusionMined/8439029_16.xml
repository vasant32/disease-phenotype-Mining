<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When using a non-oxygen-binding fluid, the therapeutic efficacy of hemodilution-induced increases in blood flow are offset by concomitant decreases in oxygen content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of hemodilution, with diaspirin cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (DCLHb), on brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was assessed during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (180 min) and reperfusion (120 min) in rats (blood volume increased by approximately 30% and n = 10 for each group): (1) 44/B: 8.0 ml of donor blood was given; (2) 30/albumin: hematocrit was decreased to 30% with 10% albumin; (3) 30/DCLHb: hematocrit was decreased to 30% with 10% DCLHb; or (4) 9/DCLHb: hematocrit was decreased to 9% with DCLHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was analyzed with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by microgravimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain injury (percent of the hemispheric area ipsilateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mean +/- SD) was greater in the 44/B group (44 +/- 4) versus the 30/albumin group (37 +/- 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, brain injury was greater in the 44/B and 30/albumin groups versus the 30/DCLHb group (27 +/- 4); which was in turn greater than the 9/DLCHb group (18 +/- 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific gravity was greater (less brain water) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hemodiluted groups versus the 44/B group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support a hypothesis that hemodilution decreases focal cerebral ischemic injury, and when an oxygen-binding fluid is used, there is a dose-dependent effect of hemodilution on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, these results suggest that hemodilution, as achieved with DCLHb, was more effective in reducing ischemic brain damage than was the same degree of hemodilution as achieved with albumin </plain></SENT>
