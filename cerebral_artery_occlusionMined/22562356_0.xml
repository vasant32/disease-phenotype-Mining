<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Social isolation (SI) is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with lack of social support systems have an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, poorer recovery, and greater functional decline after injury compared to individuals with social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attesting to the importance of social factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome is that these same effects can be reproducibly demonstrated in animals; social interaction improves behavioral deficits and reduces damage after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas SI enhances injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which SI exacerbates injury is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in male mice that were pair housed (PH) with an ovariectomized female prior to random assignment into continued PH or SI for 7 days prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of SI on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and functional recovery were assessed at 72 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear NF-κB levels and activity were assessed by Western blot and transcriptional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SI significantly exacerbated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in both male and female mice compared to PH mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SI mice had delayed functional recovery compared to PH mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An elevation of systemic IL-6 levels, increased nuclear NF-κB transcriptional activity, and enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was seen in SI <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interference with NF-κB signaling using either a pharmacological inhibitor or genetically engineered NF-κB p50 knockout mice abolished the detrimental effects of SI on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that NF-κB mediates the detrimental effects of SI </plain></SENT>
