<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacologic suppression of brain capillary Na,K-ATPase as a means to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation was examined using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in 36 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the help of a catheter inserted into the middle cerebral artery, the ischemic brain area was directly perfused with 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion was maintained as intermittent 15-second pulse injections given every 5 (n = 6) or 2 (n = 6) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By this method, the naturally occurring circulatory conditions during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the cortical specific gravity at each of six locations over the ischemic area was compared with the corresponding ischemic blood flow measured by the H2 clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> perfused every 2 minutes significantly ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation compared with six control cats perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a separate series of experiments, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> flux across the blood-brain barrier was studied by injecting 22NaCl together with an intravascular reference (<z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi>-57-labeled microspheres 15 microns in diameter) into the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain uptake index of 22Na was markedly increased in the ischemic cortex of six control cats; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> treatment in six cats suppressed the increase of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results support our hypothesis that brain capillary Na,K-ATPase activity increases during early focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, leading to enhanced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> together with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> flux across the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
