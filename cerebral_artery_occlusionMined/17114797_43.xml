<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that activation of calcium-permeable ASIC1a is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>-mediated, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> independent, ischaemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the neuroprotective time window for ASIC1a blockade in a mouse model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> is examined and the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> per se addressed by continuous pH measurements in penumbral cortex and post-ischaemic alkalization of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor blockade and ASIC1a blockade were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific ASIC1a blockade by the tarantula toxin psalmotoxin, PcTX, administered intracerebroventricularly as late as 5 h after 60 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by &gt;50%; the protection persisted for at least 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protection was also demonstrated after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In penumbral cortex alkaline pH preceded acid pH and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attenuating brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32139">NaHCO3</z:chebi> or blocking ASIC1a with PcTX were both protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> blockade produced additive neuroprotection and the presence of PcTX prolonged the time window of effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by PcTX was also achievable by intranasal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings further suggest that ASIC1a is a novel molecular target involved in ischaemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Post-ischaemic administration of an ASIC1a blocker may prove to be an effective neuroprotective strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
