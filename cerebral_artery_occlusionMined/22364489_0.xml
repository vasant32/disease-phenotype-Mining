<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors aimed to investigate the effects of various exercises on motor function, striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in cerebral ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 groups: Rota-rod training, lower speed treadmill training, higher speed treadmill training, or no exercise control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor function, striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated before or after motor training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After training, motor function and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> changed significantly in Rota-rod and higher speed treadmill training groups as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement in motor function significantly correlated with striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after motor training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly decreased in lower and higher speed treadmill training groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that both motor training procedures can be used as effective training programs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
