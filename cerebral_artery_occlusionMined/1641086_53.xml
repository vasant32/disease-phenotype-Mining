<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined three factors that may influence this variability: animal weight, vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, and extent of occlusion in rats undergoing MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also developed a four-point neurological evaluation scale and validated its usefulness by comparing it with a four-grade pathological determination of the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 82 animals subjected to a standard MCAO, 34 developed small cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (pathological grades I-II; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size less than 25 mm2, 6-17% of the ipsilateral cortex surface area), and 48 large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (pathological grades III-IV, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size greater than 25 mm2, 20-56% of surface area) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were able to predict the size of infarction from the neurological evaluation in 83% of the animals, and this accuracy reached 91% when grades I and II and III and IV were considered together (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 41 animals subjected to a more extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, 89% exhibited large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four vascular patterns were identified but none played a significant role in the incidence or size of the cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, rats weighing less than 300 g showed a smaller lesion size than did rats greater than 300 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our proposed new MCAO technique appears useful in reproducing large-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
