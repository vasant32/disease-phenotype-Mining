<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a battery of behavioral tests, we characterized functional outcome in mice over 4 weeks following 30minutes of proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated rotarod, chimney, pole and cylinder tests to assess short term functional deficits in a transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model which induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> mainly in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corner test, adhesive removal test, cylinder test, catwalk, paw preference test and novel tests of rotation were evaluated for long-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rotarod detected deficits within the first week and pole test was reliable up to intermediate time points after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corner test, adhesive removal test, catwalk and paw preference test detected deficits for up to 4 weeks, as did the novel corner rotation and bowl tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chimney and cylinder test did not prove useful in our model of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we established the pole test and rotarod as useful tools to evaluate sensory motor deficits early after mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and corner test and adhesive removal test at later time-points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, corner rotation may be a suitable test of long-term function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test batteries may be further complemented by catwalk and paw preference test for clinically relevant deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of behavioural outcome with lesion size at 28 days, and determining whether these tests are useful for detecting a potential benefit of neuroprotective or regenerative therapies requires further testing </plain></SENT>
