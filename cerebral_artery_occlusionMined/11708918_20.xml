<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This series of compounds is the most potent series of inhibitors of the enzyme described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have shown that these compounds are protective in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compound 34 significantly prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> constrictive model of neuropathic pain, compound 34 significantly attenuated the hypersensitivity observed with saline-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NAALADase inhibition may provide a new approach for the treatment of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
