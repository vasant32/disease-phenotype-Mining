<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temperature is critical to outcome in brain injury and given the importance of IL-1 in pyrogenesis this has clear mechanistic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-1 exacerbates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> independently of core (rectal) temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is temperature in the ischemic brain that influences outcome and rectal temperature is likely to be a poor surrogate marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that IL-1 exacerbates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by increasing ischemic brain temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats undergoing transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> received either 4 microg/kg IL-1 (n=9) or vehicle (n=10) intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NMR-generated maps of brain temperature, tissue perfusion, and the trace of the diffusion tensor were collected during occlusion, early reperfusion, and at 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-1 significantly increased ischemic damage at 24 hr by 35% but rectal temperature did not vary significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, ischemic brain was 1.7 degrees C cooler on reperfusion in IL-1-treated animals (vs. vehicle) and a corresponding reduction in cerebral blood flow was identified in the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the stated hypothesis, IL-1 reduced ischemic brain temperature during reperfusion and this may be due to a reduction in tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
