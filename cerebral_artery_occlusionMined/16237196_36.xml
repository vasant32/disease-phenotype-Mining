<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical side effects associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes under pathologic conditions have recently raised concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of neuroinflammatory mechanisms and neuronal survival requires knowledge of cyclooxygenase downstream pathways, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and its G-protein-coupled receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we postulate that EP1 receptor is one of the mechanisms that propagate neurotoxicity and could be a therapeutic target in brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested by pretreating C57BL/6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice with the EP1 receptor selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> ONO-DI-004 and the selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ONO-8713, followed by striatal unilateral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results revealed that ONO-DI-004 increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced lesion volume up to 128.7 +/- 12.0%, while ONO-8713 significantly decreased lesion volume to 71.3 +/- 10.9%, as compared to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxic EP1 receptor properties were also studied using C57BL/6 EP1 receptor knockout (EP1-/-) mice, which revealed a significant decrease to 74.5 +/- 8.2%, as compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ONO-8713 was also tested in the EP1-/- mice, revealing no additional protection in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results support the selectivity of ONO-8713 toward EP1 receptor and suggest the neurotoxic role of EP1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the EP1 receptor role in ischemic brain damage was investigated using a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced to 56.9 +/- 11.5% in EP1-/- mice, as compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first study that demonstrates that EP1 receptor aggravates neurotoxicity and that modulation of this receptor can determine the outcomes in both excitotoxic and focal ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
