<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of neural progenitor cell treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on white matter reorganization using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n = 26) were subjected to 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with neural progenitor cells (n = 17) or without treatment (n = 9) and were sacrificed at 5-7 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements revealed that grafted neural progenitor cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic boundary regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter reorganization, confirmed histologically, was coincident with increases of fractional anisotropy (FA, P &lt; 0.01) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the ischemic recovery regions compared to that in the ischemic core region in both treated and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral striatum bounding the lesion areas after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging revealed similar orientation patterns to the immunohistological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complementary measurements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients indicated that FT maps exhibit an overall orientation parallel to the lesion boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that FA and FT identify and characterize cerebral tissue undergoing white matter reorganization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treatment with neural progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
