<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whishaw and Coles previously described the dexterous manner in which rats manipulate food items with their paws, including thin pieces of pasta [Whishaw IQ, Coles <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Varieties of paw and digit movement during spontaneous food handling in rats: postures, bimanual coordination, preferences, and the effect of forelimb cortex lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behav Brain Res 1996;77:135-48] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We set out to develop a measure of this food handling behavior that would be quantitative, easy to administer, sensitive to the effects of damage to sensory and motor systems of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and useful for identifying the side of lateralized impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When rats handle 7 cm lengths of vermicelli, they manipulate the pasta by repeatedly adjusting the forepaw hold on the pasta piece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As operationally defined, these adjustments can be easily identified and counted by an experimenter without specialized equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After unilateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC) lesions, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> depleting (6-hydroxydopamine, 6-OHDA) lesions in adult rats, there were enduring reductions in adjustments made with the contralateral forepaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional pasta handling characteristics distinguished between the lesion types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCAO and 6-OHDA lesions increased the frequency of several identified atypical handling patterns </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, contralateral forepaw adjustment number most sensitively detected enduring impairments across lesion types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of its ease of administration and sensitivity to lateralized impairments in skilled forepaw use, this measure may be useful in rat models of upper extremity impairment </plain></SENT>
