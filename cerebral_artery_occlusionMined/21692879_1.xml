<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although BMSCs-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is considered important for neurological functional recovery, the neurorestorative mechanisms are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether BMSCs-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> enhances cerebral tissue perfusion and creates a suitable microenvironment within the ischemic brain, which in turn accelerates endogenous neurogenesis and leads to improved functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats subjected to 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were transplanted with a subpopulation of human BMSCs from male donors (Flk-1+ hBMSCs) or saline into the ipsilateral brain parenchymal at 3â€ƒdays after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flk-1+ hBMSCs-treated rats exhibited significant behavioral recovery, beginning at 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rats treated with Flk-1+ hBMSCs showed increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic activity and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flk-1+ hBMSCs treatment significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and facilitated cerebral blood flow in the ischemic boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, Flk-1+ hBMSCs treatment enhanced proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, more NSPCs migrated toward the ischemic lesion and differentiated to mature neurons or glial cells with less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Flk-1+ hBMSCs-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> induced by Flk-1+ hBMSCs promotes endogenous neurogenesis, which may cause functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
