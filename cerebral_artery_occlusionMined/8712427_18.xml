<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both clinical and experimental studies suggest that marked hemodilution (hematocrit &lt; 30%) may exacerbate neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of marked versus minimal hemodilution on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits underwent hemodilution by exchange of arterial blood with 6% high molecular weight hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the marked hemodilution group (n = 15) the target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was 6 g/100 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the minimal hemodilution group (n = 15) the target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was 11 g/100 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After hemodilution, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was achieved by embolizing an autologous blood clot via the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four hours after embolization, the animals were killed and their brains removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brains were sectioned, stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes determined via quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic physiologic variables were similar between groups, except for arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly larger in the marked hemodilution group as compared to the minimal hemodilution group, 70% +/- 19% vs 51% +/- 23%, respectively (mean +/- SD); P = 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was greater in the hemodilution group as compared to the minimal hemodilution group in both cortex (73% +/- 18% vs 54% +/- 23%, respectively; P = 0.02) and subcortex (62% +/- 25% vs 44% +/- 23%, respectively; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that marked hemodilution exacerbates neurologic injury resulting from permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although some degree of hemodilution may improve neurologic outcome, the advantage is lost at an extreme level of therapy </plain></SENT>
