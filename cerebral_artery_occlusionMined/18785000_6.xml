<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, fasudil mesylate (FM) was investigated for its neuroprotective potential in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of fasudil mesylate was also studied in rat brain cortical and hippocampal slices treated with oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> showed that cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, measured with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining, was significantly smaller in the FM-treated than in the non-FM-treated ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the brain regions vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of ischemic rats, fasudil mesylate was also found to significantly restore the enzyme protein expression level of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), which was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it remarkably reduced the protein synthesis of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) that was induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rat brain slices treated with OGD injury, fasudil mesylate increased the neuronal cell viability by 40% for cortex and by 61% for hippocampus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the presence of OGD and fasudil mesylate, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity was increased by 50% for cortex and by 58% for hippocampus, compared to OGD only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our in vivo study showed that fasudil mesylate not only decreased neurological deficit but also reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, possibly and at least partially by augmenting eNOS protein expression and inhibiting iNOS protein expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
