<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces up-regulation of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may have both beneficial and harmful effects to the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor is up-regulated in models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, but the underlying mechanisms in vivo remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present report we have investigated the concomitant changes in VEGF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5445">glyceraldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in a model of permanent and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to permanent or transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO, TMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain samples were collected at survival times ranging from 6 h to 1 week, and the levels of VEGF164 and GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were determined using reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels decreased gradually over the observation period in a similar manner in both PMCAO and TMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum levels, seen at early observation time points, did not significantly deviate from sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant changes in GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were observed, but there was a tendency towards a postischemic decrease with subsequent return to control levels over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VEGF/GAPDH ratio followed a pattern of decrease similar to VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels at 6 h after MCAO remain near baseline and thereafter decline, regardless of whether the occlusion is permanent or transient (2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings raise the question of other than transcriptional regulation of VEGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
