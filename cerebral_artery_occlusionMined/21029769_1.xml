<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the protective effect of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> extract of Ilex latifolia against transient, focal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h reperfusion (MCAO/reperfusion) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After MCAO/reperfusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were measured by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation rate were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated proteins kinases (MAPKs), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ilex latifolia (50-200 mg/kg) significantly reduced MCAO/reperfusion-induced infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, neurological deficits, and brain cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> level and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation induced by MCAO/reperfusion were inhibited by administration of Ilex latifolia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase of phosphorylated MAPKs, COX-2, and proapoptotic proteins and the decrease of antiapoptotic protein in MCAO/reperfusion rats were significantly inhibited by treatment with Ilex latifolia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ilex latifolia ameliorated ischemic injury induced by MCAO/reperfusion in rats, and this neuroprotective effect might be associated with its anti-apoptotic effect, resulting from anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions </plain></SENT>
