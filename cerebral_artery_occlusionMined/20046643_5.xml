<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion-induced oxidative conditions, astrocytes accumulate and activate in the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DJ-1 has recently been shown to be a sensor of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in living cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the function of astrocytic DJ-1 is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to clarify the effect of astrocytic DJ-1 protein under massive oxidative insult, we used a focal ischemic rat model that had been subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then investigated changes in the distribution of DJ-1 in astrocytes, DJ-1 release from cultured astrocytes, and the effects of recombinant DJ-1 protein on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and DJ-1-knockdown SH-SY5Y cells and on in vitro scavenging of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> ((*)OH) by electron spin resonance spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after 2-h MCAO and reperfusion, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion was markedly observed using magnetic resonance imaging and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, reactive astrocytes enhanced DJ-1 expression in the penumbral zone of the ischemic core and that DJ-1 protein was extracellularly released from astrocytes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> in in vitro primary cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although DJ-1-knockdown SH-SY5Y cells were markedly vulnerable to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase-tagged recombinant human DJ-1 protein (GST-DJ-1) significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, GST-DJ-1 protein directly scavenged (*)OH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induces the release of astrocytic DJ-1 protein, which may contribute to astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
