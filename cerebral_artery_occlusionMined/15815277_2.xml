<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the effects of these <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> on cerebral blood flow and metabolism that might have relevance to their respective potential for cerebral protection, fasted physiologically stable rats underwent autoradiographic determination of CBF and CMRglu during deep <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia (burst suppression of EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected, cerebral blood flow was significantly greater during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> = 157 +/- 18 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> = 54 +/- 12 ml/100 g/min) while CMRglu values were nearly identical (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> = 35 +/- 5 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> = 33 +/- 4 mumol/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional identically anesthetized rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with CBF autoradiographically determined 1 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the insult resulted in a significant reduction in the ipsilateral hemispheric and cortical blood flow in both <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> groups, flow remained at least twofold greater in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> as opposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When regional flow was assessed, no difference between groups was observed with respect to the area of tissue with flow values falling between 0-10 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats had significantly less hemispheric and cortical area with flow values in the ranges of 10-20 and 20-30 ml/100 g/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data, therefore, do not support the contention that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> causes maldistribution of CBF during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
