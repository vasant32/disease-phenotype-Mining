<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived NPCs together with biomaterial (Matrigel) scaffolding into the brains of young adult Sprague-Dawley rats 3 weeks after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurobehavioral performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the effect of NPC and Matrigel transplants in young adult (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fisher 344 rats from the National Institute on Aging's aged rodent colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distal MCAO was induced by electrocoagulation, and hESC-derived NPCs were transplanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavity 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aged rats developed larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and performance on the cylinder and elevated body swing tests, measured 6-8 weeks post-transplant, were improved by transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that advanced age does not preclude a beneficial response to NPC transplantation following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
