<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary hippocampal neurons in embryonic day 18 (E18) rats were transfected with the A20 gene by using the new Nucleofector electroporation transfection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then examined, whether A20-neurons possessed anti-apoptotic abilities after TNF-alpha stimulation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A20-neurons and pcDNA3-neurons were transplanted into the penumbra of the brains of rats that had been subjected to 90-min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A20-neurons resisted TNF-alpha induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of neurons overexpressing A20 (28.46%+/-3.87%) was lower than that in neurons transfected with pcDNA3 (53.06%+/-5.36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More A20-neurons survived in the penumbra both 3-d and 7-d after transplantation than did sham pcDNA3 neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel function of A20 may make it a potential targets for the gene therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
