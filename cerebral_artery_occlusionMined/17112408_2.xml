<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), neurological deficits and neuron loss were determined at various time points within 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors in the brain were analyzed by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CysLT1 receptor localization was detected by double immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological deficits and neuron loss were found 6, 24 and 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of both CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors were upregulated in the ischemic hemisphere 1, 24, and 48 h after MCAO with peaks at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CysLT1 receptor was selectively localized in neurons 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors are upregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the CysLT1 receptor is localized in neurons after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
