<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regional cerebrovascular reactivity (rCVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was calculated at entry to the study using 133Xe SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy consecutive patients aged less than 70 years with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were divided into 2 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reduced rCVR, and prospectively followed up for a period of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in 8 of the 23 patients with reduced rCVR at entry and in 3 of 47 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative recurrence-free survival rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and in each subgroup of patients with ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and reduced rCVR on entry, were significantly lower than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCVR (P=0.0030, P=0.0404, and P=0.0310, respectively; Kaplan-Meier analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the factors considered, only lower rCVR and resting regional cerebral blood flow values were significantly associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (P=0.0019 and P=0.0080, respectively; Cox regression multivariate analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that reduced rCVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> as determined by 133Xe SPECT is significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
