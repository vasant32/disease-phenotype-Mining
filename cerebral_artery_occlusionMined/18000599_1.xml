<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is successfully used for thrombolysis in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it may increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system is critically involved in basal lamina degradation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion following rt-PA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the effects of different doses of rt-PA (saline, 0.9, 9, or 18 mg rt-PA/kg body weight) on the MMPs, their specific inhibitors (TIMPs), and also their inducer protein EMMPRIN following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (3 hours [h], 24 h reperfusion, suture model) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of MMP-2 and -9 was measured by gelatine zymography, TIMP-1 and -2 by reverse gelatine zymography, and the content of EMMPRIN and the basal lamina component collagen type IV by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of both MMPs steadily rose with increasing doses of rt-PA (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, their endogenous inhibitors TIMPs decreased (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A balance between the proteases and their inhibitors was achieved at the low dose of 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA in the rats, which significantly coincided with the demonstrated protection of collagen type IV degradation at this dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inducer protein EMMPRIN increased in parallel to its substrate MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous rt-PA leads to an increase of the MMP-inducing system by EMMPRIN, and a rise of the degrading MMPs follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at low to moderate doses of rt-PA the microvascular basal lamina was protected, probably due to inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by the upregulation of their inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This strongly supports use of the lowest effective dosage of rt-PA available </plain></SENT>
