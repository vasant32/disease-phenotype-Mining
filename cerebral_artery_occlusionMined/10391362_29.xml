<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that high-dose human serum albumin (HSA) therapy confers marked histological protection in experimental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment with high-dose HSA would protect in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours prior to TBI, the fluid percussion interface was positioned parasagittally over the right cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the following day, fasted rats were anesthetized with 3% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, 70% nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, and 30% oxygen and received right parieto-occipital parasagittal fluid-percussion injury (1.5-2.0 atm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial and rectal temperatures were monitored throughout the experiment and held at normothermic levels (36.5-37.5 degrees C) by a warming lamp above the animal's head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The agent (25% human serum albumin, HSA) or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> 0.9%) was administered i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(1% of body weight) 15 min after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral function was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats before and after TBI (at 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0-12 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score = 0; maximal score = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven days after TBI, brains were perfusion-fixed, coronal sections at various levels were digitized, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> areas in the superficial, middle and deep layers of cortex and in the underlying fimbria were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HSA significantly improved the neurological score compared to saline at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days after TBI (6.0 +/- 0.6 [albumin] versus 8.4 +/- 0.5 [saline]; 3.6 +/- 0.7 versus 6.8 +/- 1.0; and 2.6 +/- 0.6 versus 5.7 +/- 0.8, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HSA therapy also significantly reduced total <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> area (0.89 +/- 0.2 versus 1.82 +/- 0.3 mm2; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings document that high-concentration albumin therapy instituted 15 min after trauma significantly improves the neurological score and reduces histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We believe that this pharmacological agent may have promising potential for the clinical treatment of brain injury </plain></SENT>
