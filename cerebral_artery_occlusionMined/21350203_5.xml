<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombolysis therapy using tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is occasionally accompanied by harmful outcomes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported that Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-7 (SMTP-7), a candidate thrombolytic drug, has excellent therapeutic effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in mice; however, little is known regarding whether this agent influences cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> following thrombolytic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to compare the effects of recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) and SMTP-7 on cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The impact of rt-PA- and SMTP-7-induced thrombolytic reperfusion on leukocyte dynamics was investigated in a photochemically induced thrombotic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) model in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both rt-PA and SMTP-7 administration in tMCAo mice (each 10 mg/kg) resulted in thrombolytic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SMTP-7-administered mice showed relatively mild rolling and attachment of leukocytes to the vascular wall in the middle cerebral vein, with weak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> reactions and proinflammatory gene expression (IL-1β, TNF-α, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1); thus, a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with rt-PA-administered mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro study suggested that rt-PA at 20 ��g/mL, but not SMTP-7 at a similar concentration, promotes cytokine-induced reactive oxygen species generation in cultured endothelial cells; moreover, SMTP-7 suppressed cytokine-induced VCAM-1 induction in the cells and leukocyte/ endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relatively mild cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the SMTP-7 mice, compared with in rt-PA mice, is thought to be caused at least in part by direct antioxidative actions of SMTP-7 in ECs </plain></SENT>
