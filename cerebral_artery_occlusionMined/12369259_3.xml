<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five male Swiss <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>Albino</z:mp> rats were assigned into one of four groups: sham operated as controls, subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or injection of MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) either 30 min before or just after right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> were expressed as nmol malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and conjugated diene (CD)/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> values after 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> relative to contralateral cortex and CD levels in 0, 10 and 60 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were found to be higher in ipsilateral cortex than those in contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, contralateral cerebellar <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels in 0 and 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and CD levels in 0, 10 and 60 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were found to be higher than those in ipsilateral cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor by MK-801 before or just after permanent MCAO decreased significantly the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and CD levels in both cortex and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no significant differences found in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> values between rats pre- and posttreated with MK-801, CD levels in posttreated group seemed significantly lower than those in pretreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the whole, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and CD represent early biochemical marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in ischemic tissues, reflecting the radical-mediated tissue damage </plain></SENT>
