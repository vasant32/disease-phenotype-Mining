<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was greatly reduced at 24 h of reperfusion by the treatment with IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis in the middle cerebral artery territory showed that Caspase-3 staining was markedly reduced in the cases with IGF-1 treatment, but 72-kDa heat shock protein staining remained almost unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that treatment with IGF-1 exerts a significant effect on ameliorating brain injury after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this effect is greatly associated with the reduction of Caspase-3 staining, but is only minimally associated with a decreasd stress response at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
