<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium currents are major determinants of neuronal behavior, and pathological modulation of Ca(2+)-channels is known to lead to altered excitability states in a variety of paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we addressed the question to what extent whole cell calcium currents are altered after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in both the ipsi- and contralateral sensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 1 h in rats using the intraluminal thread model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 7 or 28 days survival, whole cell patch clamp studies were carried out on freshly isolated neurons of the ipsi- and contralateral sensory cortex, and high voltage activated (HVA) calcium currents were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In lesioned animals, we found a significant increase of calcium current amplitude and maximal conductance in the sensory cortex contralateral to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled by a prominent positive shift of the potential of half-maximal activation (V(h,a)) in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes were long-lasting and at least stable for the following 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations were present in animals with lesions of moderate size, but not in those with massive infarction, and only in the cortex contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following cortical infarctions, changes of calcium current properties are selectively observed in neurons contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the behavioral level, compensatory mechanisms involving the unaffected hemisphere may induce this alteration of calcium current properties </plain></SENT>
