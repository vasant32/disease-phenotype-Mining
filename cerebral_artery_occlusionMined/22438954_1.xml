<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carvacrol (CAR), a naturally occurring monoterpenic <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="35617">food additive</z:chebi>, has been shown to have antimicrobials, antitumor, and antidepressant-like activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous study demonstrated that CAR has the ability to protect liver against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the protective effects of CAR on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that CAR (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological deficits after 75 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection was in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment with CAR still provided protection on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when it was administered intraperitoneally at 2 h after reperfusion; however, intracerebroventricular post-treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume even when the mice were treated with CAR at 6 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that CAR has an extended therapeutic window, but delivery strategies may affect the protective effects of CAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, we found that CAR significantly decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3, a marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting the anti-apoptotic activity of CAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data indicated that CAR treatment increased the level of phosphorylated Akt and the neuroprotection of CAR was reversed by a PI3K inhibitor LY-294002, demonstrating the involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of CAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to its safety and wide use in the food industry, CAR is a promising agent to be translated into clinical trials </plain></SENT>
