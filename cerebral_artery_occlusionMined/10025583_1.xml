<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice with targeted inactivation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> oxidase B (MAO-B) gene received i.p. administration of saline (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent ligation of the left common and external carotid arteries, followed by cauterization of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours post-surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups showed right <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> of the torso but no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo>, lateral instability, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes were assessed from digitized video-images of serial sections of the brain stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>/Eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant group differences were detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (14-18% of ipsilateral cortex) or in the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (4-7% increase in ipsilateral hemispheric swelling with respect to contralateral side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that absence of the MAO-B gene or inhibition of the enzyme with L-deprenyl are not protective or detrimental in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
