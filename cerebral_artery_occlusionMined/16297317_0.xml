<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship of changes in basement membrane of cerebral micro-vessels and plasminogen activator system after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was produced by the introduction of a thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided randomly into sham-operation group with young rats (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> 3 hours and I/R 6, 12, 24, 72, 144 hours groups), sham-operation group and I/R groups in aged rats (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> 3 hours and I/R 6, 12, 24, 72, 144 hours groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical technique, zymogram analysis, and reverse zymogram analysis were used to study changes in basement membrane structure of cerebral-cortex microvessel, type IV collagen (Col IV) and laminin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) contents, and plasminogen activator system in every group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the increase of age, Col IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> contents of the microvessel basement membrane increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With prolongation of I/R, the contents of Col IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> decreased in both young and aged rats, while the contents of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase plasminogen (u-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) expression increased at the beginning and decreased subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with young groups, Col IV (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 3 hours-I/R 12 hours), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 3 hours-I/R 24 hours), t-PA (I/R 6-24 hours) and u-PA (I/R 12-144 hours) expression levels were higher in aged rats, but PAI-1 (I/R 12 and 24 hours) expression was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, changes in PAI-1 contents as determined with reverse zymogram analysis method coincided with its immunoexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the increase of age, alterations in constituents of cerebro-microvessel basement membrane (Col IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Injury to cerebro-microvessel basement membrane resulted in more serious changes in aged rats compared with the young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in cerebro-microvessel basement membrane after I/R injury in the aged SD rats is related to change in plasminogen activator system </plain></SENT>
