<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, newly formed neuronal cells and blood vessels that appear in the nonischemic ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus with secondary damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not been previously studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats were subjected to distal right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">Bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to label cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 7 or 14 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal nuclei (NeuN), OX-42, BrdU, nestin, laminin(+), BrdU(+)/nestin(+), BrdU(+)/NeuN(+), nestin(+)/GFAP(+)(glial fibrillary acidic protein), and BrdU(+)/laminin(+) immunoreactive cells were detected within the ipsilateral VPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary infarction was confined to the right somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the ipsilateral VPN of the ischemic rats, the number of NeuN(+) neurons decreased, the OX-42(+) microglia cells were activated, and BrdU(+) and nestin(+) cells were detected at day 7 after MCAO and increased in number at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BrdU(+)/nestin(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells were detected at day 14 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ischemic rats showed a significant increase in vascular density in the ipsilateral VPN compared with the sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that secondary damage with neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> of the ipsilateral VPN of the thalamus occurs after focal cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
