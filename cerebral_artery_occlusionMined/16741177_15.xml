<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied selective inhibition of integrin alphavbeta3 with cyclo [Arg-Gly-Asp<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996">-D-Phe</z:chebi>-Val] (cRGDfV) in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were treated before and after MCAO with cRGDfV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters, expression of integrin alphavbeta3, infarction volume, brain water content, Evans Blue exudation, IgG exudation, histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were studied in 4 groups of animals: sham operation (n=13), untreated (n=18), nonfunctioning <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> treatment (n=19), and cRGDfV treatment (n=27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with cRGDfV reduced infarction, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, reduced exudation of Evans blue and IgG, and prevented fibrinogen deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed reduction of phosphorylated Flk-1 (a vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor), reduction of phosphorylated FAK (an intracellular kinase phosphorylated in the presence of VEGF), reduction of VEGF, and reduction of fibrinogen in the cRGDfV treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The selective integrin alphavbeta3 inhibitor cRGDfV improves outcomes in the MCAO model by preserving the blood-brain barrier, which mechanistically may occur in a VEGF- and VEGF-receptor-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
