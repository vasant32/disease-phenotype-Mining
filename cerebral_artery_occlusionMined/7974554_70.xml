<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This research was performed to determine whether a selective inhibitor of the calcium-dependent protease, calpain, could reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-associated brain damage when peripherally administered after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A variation of the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A range of doses of AK295 (a novel calpain inhibitor synthesized for this purpose) was continuously infused through the internal carotid artery, beginning 1.25 hours from the initiation of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 21 hours, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postocclusion (1.25-hour) infusion of the calpain inhibitor AK295 elicited a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest dose tested (3 mg/kg per hour) afforded the maximum effect, illustrated by a 32% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 21 hours after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (vehicle, 81.7 +/- 4.7 mm3; AK295, 54.9 +/- 6.9 mm3; P &lt; .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first evidence that a peripherally administered calpain inhibitor can protect against ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They offer further support for an important role of calpain proteolysis in the brain degeneration associated with cerebral ischemic events and suggest that selective calpain inhibitors provide a rational, novel, and viable means of treating such neurodegenerative problems </plain></SENT>
