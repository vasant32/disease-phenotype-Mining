<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified its upregulation in gene microarrays following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LIF expression and localization was measured in human ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> autopsy specimens, in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and in human foetal neural cell cultures following oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
