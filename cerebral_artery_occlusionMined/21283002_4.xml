<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that cinnamophilin ([8R, 8'S]-4, 4'-dihydroxy-3, 3'-dimethoxy-7-oxo-8, 8'-neolignan) exhibited potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, radical-scavenging, and anti-inflammatory actions and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic brain damage, even when it was given up to 6 hrs postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterized the long-lasting neuroprotection of cinnamophilin against gray and white matter damage and its beneficial effects on electrophysiological and functional outcomes in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective laboratory animal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Research laboratory in a university teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (240-290 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Under controlled conditions of normoxia, normocarbia, and normothermia, spontaneously breathing, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized (1.0-1.5%) rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 90 mins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cinnamophilin (80 mg/kg) or vehicle was given intravenously at reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physiological parameters, including arterial blood gases and cortical blood perfusion, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and neurobehavioral outcomes, were serially examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 7 days or 21 days postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gray matter and white matter (axonal and myelin) damage were then evaluated by quantitative histopathology and immunohistochemistry against phosphorylated component-H neurofilaments and myelin basic protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the follow-up period of 7 and 21 days, our results showed that cinnamophilin significantly decreased gray matter damage by 31.6% and 34.9% (p &lt; .05, respectively) without notable adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cinnamophilin effectively reduced axonal and myelin damage by 46.3-68.6% (p &lt; .05) and 25.2-28.1% (p &lt; .05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cinnamophilin not only improved the ipsilateral field potentials (p &lt; .05, respectively), but also reduced the severity of contralateral electrophysiological diaschisis (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Consequently, cinnamophilin improved sensorimotor outcomes up to 21 days postinsult (p &lt; .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration with cinnamophilin provides long-lasting neuroprotection against gray and white matter damage and improves functional and electrophysiological outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a need for further studies to characterize the potential of cinnamophilin in the field of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
