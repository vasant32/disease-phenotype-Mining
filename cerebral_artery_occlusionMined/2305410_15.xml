<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three days later the rats were decapitated and the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were compared with those in 10 control rats that received saline before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the cerebral cortex was reduced by 33% in the group treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47833">methionine sulfoximine</z:chebi> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This protective effect may be mediated by a presynaptic mechanism; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47833">methionine sulfoximine</z:chebi> profoundly inhibits brain glutamine synthetase, thereby interrupting the astrocyte-neuron <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> shuttle and impairing neuronal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47833">Methionine sulfoximine</z:chebi> also increases brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> stores, and this increased energy reserve may benefit penumbral tissue during the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further study of the mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47833">methionine sulfoximine</z:chebi> decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume could lead to new therapeutic approaches for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
