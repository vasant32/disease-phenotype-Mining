<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both agents are candidates for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For evaluation of synergistic effects of bFGF and citicoline, a low-dose combination of both compounds was tested against each compound alone and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n=12 per group) underwent 90 minutes of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with the use of the suture model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly and blindly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: placebo, low-dose citicoline (250 mg/kg IP daily for 4 days), low-dose bFGF (10 microg/kg per hour IV for 3 hours), and the combination of both (250 mg/kg citicoline and 10 microg/kg per hour bFGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was used after 4 days to determine postmortem infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were assessed on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The premature mortality rate was 41.7% in the placebo and citicoline groups, 33.3% in the bFGF group, and 25% (P=NS) in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean neurological score on day 4 was 3.1+/-1.6 (placebo), 3.1+/-1.6 (citicoline), 2.9+/-1.5 (bFGF), and 2.4+/-1.4 (combination) (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of infarction was significantly reduced in the combination group (136 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5+/-25.4 mm3) versus placebo (172.6+/-48.9 mm3; P=0.036, Fisher test), versus citicoline alone (186.0+/-35.7 mm3; P=0.005, Fisher test), and versus bFGF alone (176.0+/-49.2 mm3; P=0.023, Fisher test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate synergistic effects of a low-dose combination of the growth factor bFGF and citicoline after temporary experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and furthermore support the effectiveness of a combination treatment regimen for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
