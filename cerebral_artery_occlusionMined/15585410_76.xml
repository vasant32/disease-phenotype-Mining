<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were reported to ameliorate functional deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats, with some of this improvement possibly resulting from the action of cytokines secreted by these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To enhance such cytokine effects, we previously transfected the telomerized human MSC with the BDNF gene using a fiber-mutant adenovirus vector and reported that such treatment contributed to improved ischemic recovery in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether other cytokines in addition to BDNF, i.e., GDNF, CNTF, or NT3, might have a similar or greater effect in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats that received MSC-BDNF (P &lt; 0.05) or MSC-GDNF (P &lt; 0.05) showed significantly more functional recovery as demonstrated by improved behavioral test results and reduced ischemic damage on MRI than did control rats 7 and 14 days following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, rats that received MSC-CNTF or MSC-NT3 showed neither functional recovery nor ischemic damage reduction compared to control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, MSC transfected with the BDNF or GDNF gene resulted in improved function and reduced ischemic damage in a rat model of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that gene-modified cell therapy may be a useful approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
