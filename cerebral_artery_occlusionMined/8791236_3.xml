<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to measure the dose-response of cerebral infarcted volume to the agent administered 30 min after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and to test whether short-term infusion of this drug reduces ischemic cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: low dose group, a bolus of 12.4 mg/kg MDL-100,453 followed by infusion of 31.7 mg/kg/h MDL-100,453; middle and high dose groups, bolus and infusion doses increased to 24.8 mg/kg, 63.3 mg/kg/h and 49.6 mg/kg, 126.7 mg/kg/h, respectively; and control group, saline used for bolus and infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced by insertion of intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infusion was accomplished by a microprocessor controlled pump connected to a jugular vein, which delivered drug or saline over a period of 9 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly reduced in both middle (46%) and high (52%) dose groups compared with the saline group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was found in the low dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), but poor inverse correlation existed between the average blood level of MDL-100,453 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that a short-term (9 h) intravenous administration of an appropriate dose of MDL-100,453 beginning 30 min after MCAO significantly reduces ischemic lesion volume at 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
