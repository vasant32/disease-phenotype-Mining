<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dihydroriboflavin, a compound produced from <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> (B2) by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30527">flavin</z:chebi> reductase, rapidly reduces oxidized iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since treatment with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> offers protection from ischemic injury in other tissues, we tested the effect of pretreatment with B2 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two different models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats were tested: transcranial electrocautery and intracarotid occlusion with a nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups of 6-8 animals were treated with 7.5 mg of B2/kg or saline vehicle 1 h before MCAO and brain water content was determined after 4 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with B2 reduced total hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation from 0.37 +/- 0.05 to 0.19 +/- 0.05 mg/g dry wt </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was greater following MCAO with the intra-carotid thread (0.54 +/- 0.05 ml/g) but protection by B2 was less (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pretreatment with B2 reduces ischemic brain injury, perhaps by reacting with oxidized iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> produced by the thread MCAO method makes it more difficult to observe protection following brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in this model </plain></SENT>
