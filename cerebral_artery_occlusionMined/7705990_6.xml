<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each ROI measurements were made either during 30 min or 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by 1 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the periphery of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, an area of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with a mean reduction of flow to 38% (39.9% in the group with 30 min <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 35.9% in the group with 2 h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) of preischemic values was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Closer to the center of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with a mean reduction of flow to 21% (19.9% in the 30-min group and 22.9% in the 2-hour group) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two groups with laser Doppler flowmetry in the ROI of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a compensatory increase in flow during the first 3-6 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats displayed a peak hyperperfusion immediately after re-establishing of flow which then stabilized above, below, or equal to the preischemic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This peak hyperemia was most abundant in the group in which flow was measured in the ROI of more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after the 30-min <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the same area a short hyperemic peak was followed by a significant hypoperfusion of 60% of preischemic flow after 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the groups with flow measurements in the ROI of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there was a return to preischemic flow after the 30-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and a tendency of preserved hyperemia after 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
