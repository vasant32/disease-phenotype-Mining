<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CTX0E03 is a human neural stem cell line previously reported to reduce sensorymotor deficits in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate if CTX0E03 treatment promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> leads to damage of the vasculature in the brain, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may contribute to the functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, the angiogenic activity of CTX0E03 was assessed both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CTX0E03 expression of trophic and pro-angiogenic factors was determined by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA and its angiogenic activity was investigated in well-established <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was investigated in na誰ve mouse and MCAo rat brain and was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Von Willebrand</z:e> Factor (VWF), a marker of blood vessel formation, and BrdU/CD31 double labeling in na誰ve mice only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro results showed that CTX0E03 conditioned medium and co-culture significantly increased total tubule formation compared with controls (p=0.002 and p=0.0008 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CTX0E03 cells were found to be in direct association with the tubules by immunocytochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo CTX0E03 treated brains demonstrated a significant increase in areas occupied by VWF positive microvessels compared with vehicle treated na誰ve mouse (2 way ANOVA, Interaction p&lt;0.05, Treatment p&lt;0.0001, Time p&lt;0.0) and MCAo rat (p=0.001 unpaired t-test, Welch's correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTX0E03 treated na誰ve mouse brains showed an increase in BrdU/CD31 colabeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in vitro CTX0E03 cells express pro-angiogenic factors and may promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> by both release of paracrine factors and direct physical interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vivo CTX0E03 treated rodent brains exhibited a significant increase in microvessels at the site of implantation compared with vehicle injected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together these data suggest that CTX0E03 cell therapy may provide significant benefit to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients through up-regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
