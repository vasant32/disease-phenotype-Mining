<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with the activation of glial cells, infiltration of leukocytes and an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in the ischemic brain and systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> influences lesion size and neurological outcome remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>D-JNKI1, an inhibitor of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, is strongly neuroprotective in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the protection mediated by D-JNKI1 is high even with intravenous administration at very low doses with undetectable drug levels in the brain, pointing to a systemic mode of action, perhaps on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We evaluated whether D-JNKI1, administered intravenously 3â€‰h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), modulates secretion of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine in the plasma and from the spleen and brain at several time points after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found an early release of both mediators in the systemic circulation followed by an increase in the brain and went on to show a later systemic increase in vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Release of interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine from the spleen of mice with MCAO was not significantly different from sham mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the secretion of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> was not altered in the systemic circulation or brain after successful neuroprotection with D-JNKI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that neuroprotection with D-JNKI1 after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is independent of systemic and brain release of interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings suggest that the early systemic release of interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine may not necessarily predict an unfavorable outcome in this model </plain></SENT>
