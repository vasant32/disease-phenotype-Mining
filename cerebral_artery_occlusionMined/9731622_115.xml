<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A short duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (ie, ischemic preconditioning [PC]) can provide significant brain protection to subsequent ischemic events (ie, ischemic tolerance [IT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present series of studies was conducted to characterize the temporal pattern of a PC paradigm, to systematically evaluate the importance of protein synthesis in PC-induced IT, and to explore candidate gene expression changes associated with IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (10 minutes) was used for PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various periods of reperfusion (ie, 2, 6, and 12 hours and 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days) were allowed after PC and before permanent MCAO (PMCAO) (n=7 to 9 per group) to establish IT compared with non-PC (sham-operated) rats (n=22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size, forelimb and hindlimb motor function, and cortical perfusion (laser-Doppler flowmetry; n=9 per group) were measured after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> administered just before PC (n= 13 to 17) or administered long after PC but just before PMCAO (n=7 to 8) on IT were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interleukin- receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reactions [n=20] and Northern analysis [n=50]) and protein expression (immunohistochemistry [n=16]) after PC and early response gene expression (Northern analysis [n=16]) after PMCAO in PC animals were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced only if PC was performed 1 day (decreased 58.4%), 2 days (decreased 58.1%), or 7 days (decreased 59.4%) before PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PC significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced neurological deficits (similar to reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> eliminated ischemic PC-induced IT effects on both brain injury and neurological deficits if administered before PC (P&lt;0.05) but not if administered long after PC but before PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PC did not produce any significant brain injury, alter cortical blood flow after PMCAO, or produce contralateral cortical neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) only during the IT period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PC rats also exhibited a significant (P&lt;0.01) reduction in c-fos and zif268 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PC is a powerful inducer of ischemic brain tolerance as reflected by preservation of brain tissue and motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PC induces IT that is dependent on de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>New protein(s) that occurs at the PC brain site 1 to 7 days after PC contributes to the neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Those proteins that are produced after the more severe PMCAO in PC animals apparently do not contribute to IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The PC-induced IT is also associated with increased expression of the neuroprotective protein interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and a reduced postischemic expression of the early response genes c-fos and zif268 </plain></SENT>
