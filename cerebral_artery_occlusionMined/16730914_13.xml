<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which controls neuronal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we first tested whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment enhances neurological functional outcome and neuronal differentiation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in retired breeder 12 month rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased expression of mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1, beta-tubulin III, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the ischemic brain, and concomitantly improved functional outcome compared with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased neurogenesis significantly correlated with functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-induced neuronal differentiation, experiments were performed on neurospheres derived from retired breeder rat subventricular zone cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> increased neuronal differentiation and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 gene expression in cultured neurospheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor-treated neurospheres significantly increased mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 and beta-tubulin III expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-induced mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 and beta-tubulin III expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> increases neuronal differentiation in retired breeder rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression, influences mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 transcription factor, which in turn, facilitates an increase in subventricular zone neuronal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-mediated molecular events may contribute to the improved functional outcome in retired breeder rats subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
