<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms regulating action of IL-1 are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify this central issue, mice that were gene deficient both IL-1alpha and beta (IL-1 KO) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were subjected to 1 hour transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) which is considered to be a reliable oxidative DNA damage by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, in brain and of total nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in plasma were determined by use of HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after tMCAO, the ratio of 8OHdG to dG in the ipsilateral hemisphere of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were 2.24 x 10(-3) and 4.41 x 10(-3) in the neocortex and striatum, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 8OHdG in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was higher than that of the IL-1 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of total NO in the plasma of IL-1 KO mice was also lower than that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> 24 hours after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that IL-1 is participated in generating reactive oxygen spices and it aggravates and induces the ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>.(183 words) </plain></SENT>
