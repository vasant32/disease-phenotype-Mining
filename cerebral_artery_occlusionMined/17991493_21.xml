<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that SUMOylation can regulate kainate receptor (KAR) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated changes in protein SUMOylation and levels of KAR and AMPA receptor subunits in two different animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models: a rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion and a mouse model without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) resulted in a striatal and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dramatic increase in SUMOylation by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 was observed at 6h and 24h in the striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and by SUMO-2/3 at 24h in the hippocampus, which was not directly subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice, permanent MCAO resulted in a selective cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No changes in SUMOylation occurred at 6h but there was increased SUMO-1 conjugation in the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and non-ischemic hippocampus at 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SUMOylation by SUMO-2/3 occurred only outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both rat and mouse levels of KARs were only decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions whereas AMPARs were decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in other brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that posttranslational modification by SUMO and down-regulation of AMPARs and KARs may play important roles in the pathophysiological response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
