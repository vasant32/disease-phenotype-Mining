<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to MCAO each animal was randomized to one of the following groups: 1) control, mean arterial pressure (89 +/- 10 mmHg [mean +/- SD]), blood volume, and hematocrit (46 +/- 1) were not manipulated; 2) hypervolemic hemodilution (HH), 30 min before MCAO, 5% albumin was administered to reduce the hematocrit to 29-32%; or 3) hypervolemic hemodilution/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HH/Dop), hemodilution was accomplished and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was infused during the ischemic period to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 111 +/- 10 mmHg (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
