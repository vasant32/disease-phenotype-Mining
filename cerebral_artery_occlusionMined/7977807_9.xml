<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Penumbral blood flow (CBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF values (expressed as % preischemic values) in normothermic and hyperthermic groups were 24 +/- 11 (SD) and 24 +/- 16%, respectively, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 102 +/- 81 and 147 +/- 79% during recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the hyperthermic group increased from a baseline of 7 +/- 2 microM to a peak of 217 +/- 184 microM at 10-20 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but returned to near baseline after 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> in the normothermic group increased from 4 +/- 2 microM to a peak of 26 +/- 17 microM at 10-20 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion but fell to near-baseline before recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus reuptake systems appeared to remain functional in ischemic penumbra, even during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release was significantly higher in hyperthermic than in normothermic rats: average values of individual rats' peak levels were 251 +/- 221 microM and 37 +/- 34 microM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ischemic CBF threshold value for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release was 33% of control in the normothermic group but 61% in the hyperthermic group </plain></SENT>
