<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor for survival and generation of striatal neurons after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, recombinant adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors carrying brain-derived neurotrophic factor or green fluorescent protein genes were injected into right rat substantia nigra 4-5 weeks prior to 30 min ipsilateral of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain-derived neurotrophic factor-recombinant adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transduction markedly increased the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein by nigral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was transported anterogradely to the striatum and released in biologically active form, as revealed by the hypertrophic response of striatal neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals transduced with brain-derived neurotrophic factor-recombinant adeno-associated virus also exhibited abnormalities in body posture and movements, including tilted body to the right, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>choreiform movements</z:hpo> of left forelimb and head, and spontaneous, so-called 'barrel' rotation along their long axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The continuous delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor had no effect on the survival of striatal projection neurons after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but exaggerated the loss of cholinergic, and parvalbumin- and neuropeptide Y-positive, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>-ergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the animals subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also gave rise to an increased number of striatal cells expressing doublecortin, a marker for migrating neuroblasts, and cells double-labelled with the mitotic marker, 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine-5'monophosphate, and early neuronal (Hu) or striatal neuronal (Meis2) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that long-term anterograde delivery of high levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor increases the vulnerability of striatal interneurons to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, brain-derived neurotrophic factor potentiates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neurogenic response, at least at early stages </plain></SENT>
