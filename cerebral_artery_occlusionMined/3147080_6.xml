<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> major, disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with presumed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with the clot specific thrombolytic agent tissue plasminogen activator roughly three and a half hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> computed tomography (CT) scan before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No appreciable systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred, apart from <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>bruising</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> into the subarachnoid space from a microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, which was found at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haematological monitoring of the two patients showed pronounced fibrinogenolysis and alpha 2 antiplasmin consumption in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient showed transient improvement during the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases extensive infarction, partly haemorrhagic in one, with massive concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was found on repeated CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients deteriorated and eventually died as a consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the one patient who came to necropsy a moderate, probably pre-existing smooth stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery was found, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral vessels being patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that thrombolytic treatment with a clot specific agent such as tissue plasminogen activator started three to four hours after a major ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be hazardous, not because of haemorrhagic transformation of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> but because early reperfusion may promote massive, potentially fatal cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
