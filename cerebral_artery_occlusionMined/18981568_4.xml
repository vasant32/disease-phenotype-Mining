<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that SR prevents neuronal cell damage induced by Abeta (25--35) in cultured rat cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to further investigate the neuroprotective effect of SR on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced toxicity in primary culture of rat cortical neurons, and on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SR, over a concentration range of 10--50 microg/ml, inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> (100 microM)-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which was significantly inhibited by MK-801 (5 microM), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (20 microM), an L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of SR (10-50 microg/ml), MK-801 (5 microM), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (20 microM) inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced elevation of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) measured by a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51103">Fluo-4</z:chebi> AM </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, SR prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were significantly reduced in rats that received SR (10, 30 mg/kg, orally), with a corresponding improvement in neurological function </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that SR inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by interfering with the increase of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, and inhibiting <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and generation of ROS, and that the neuroprotective effect of SR against focal cerebral ischemic injury is due to its anti-oxidative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus SR might have therapeutic roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
