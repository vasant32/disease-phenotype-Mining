<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although COX-2 inhibitors could be beneficial, they have significant side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others have shown that the EP1 receptor is important in mediating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with a highly selectiveEP1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ONO-8713, would improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome and that post-treatment would attenuate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> excitotoxicity and protect organotypic brain slices from oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with ONO-8713 before being subjected to 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 96-h reperfusion.Significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was observed in groups given 0.1 (25.9 +/- 4.7%) and 1.0 nmol(27.7 +/- 2.8%) ONO-8713 as compared with the vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the effects of ONO-8713 post-treatment on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> induced excitotoxicity, mice were given a unilateral intrastriatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> injection followed by one intraperitoneal injection of 10 microg/kg ONO-8713, 1 and 6 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant attenuation of brain damage (26.6 +/-4.9%) was observed at 48 hin the ONO-8713-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, brain slice cultures were protected (25.5 +/- 2.9%) by the addition of ONO-8713 to the medium after OGD.These findings support the notion that the EP1receptor propagates neurotoxicity and that selective blockade could be considered as a potential preventive and/or therapeutic tool against ischemic/hypoxic neurological conditions </plain></SENT>
