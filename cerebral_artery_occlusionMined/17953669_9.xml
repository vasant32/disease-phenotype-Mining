<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the modulation of rat A(2A) receptor expression and functioning, in rat cerebral cortex and striatum, following in vivo focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cortex, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not induce any alterations in A(2A) receptor binding and functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, in striatum, a significant decrease in A(2A) ligand affinity, associated with an increase in receptor density, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In striatum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also induced a significant reduction both in G protein pool and in A(2A) receptor-G protein coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, A(2A) receptor functional responsiveness, measured as stimulation of adenylyl cyclise, was not affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting receptor up-regulation may represent a compensatory mechanism to maintain receptor functioning during cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed that following 24 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, A(2A) ARs were definitely expressed both on neurons and activated microglia in ischemic striatum and cortex, but were not detected on astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the non-ischemic hemisphere and in sham-operated rats A(2A) ARs were barely detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modifications of ARs may play a significant role in determining <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> effects during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and therefore should be taken into account when evaluating time-dependent protective effects of specific A(2A) active compounds </plain></SENT>
