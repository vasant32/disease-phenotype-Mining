<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in anesthetized rats was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the first exposed to ultrasound, the second a control of the ultrasound group, and the third a method control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each group, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1.5 hours, during which time the rats in the ultrasound group were exposed to 1 hour of pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz; spatial-average temporal-average intensity, 0.1 W/cm2 at a duty cycle of 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occlusion period was followed by a 24-hour recirculation period, after which the brains were excised and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound did not affect the volume of ischemic damage in nonperfused brain tissue or add ischemic damage to perfused brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under these experimental conditions, ultrasound does not cause additional ischemic damage to the rat brain during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
