<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the enormity of problem, currently there is no established therapy, which can restore the blood flow at infracted area and also improve the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of an endothelin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (TAK-044) in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were pretreated with TAK-044 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days and thereafter subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using intraluminal thread for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>30 min after reperfusion the animals were subjected to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for assessment of protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later the motor performance was tested and subsequently the animals were sacrificed for estimation of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>; malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control group received vehicle (saline) and similar experimental protocol was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the TAK-044 pretreated group, percent hemispheric lesion area (% HLA) in DWI was significantly attenuated 17.5 +/- 0.5% as compared to control group 61.2 +/- 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant motor impairment, with significant elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, decrease in GSH and SOD were observed in the vehicle treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with TAK-044 prevented the motor impairment and significantly reversed the changes in markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, GSH and SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to well-known vasodilatory effect, TAK-044 has recently been documented to have <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects can contribute to the protection afforded by TAK-044 in the present study </plain></SENT>
