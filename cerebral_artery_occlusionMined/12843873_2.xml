<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Effective collateral blood flow seem to be an important factor associated with a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess leptomeningeal collateral blood flow on source perfusion-weighted images in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 29 patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> alone, n=17; <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> + internal carotid artery [ICA] occlusion, n=12) were evaluated with MRI at baseline before thrombolytic therapy, and at day 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was performed at days 0 and 60 with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, and at day 60 with the modified Rankin score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed (on source images of the dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion [PWI] sequence) the presence of a hypointensity consistent with delayed contrast arrival within the global perfusion deficit (delayed perfusion sign) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the extent of the area demonstrating such delayed perfusion (DP area) on source images of the PWI sequence, and compared it with the global perfusion (GP) abnormality shown by time-to-peak maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the DP/GP ratio and: 1. age; 2. clinical scores; 3. site of occlusion [<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> alone versus ICA+<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion]; 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DWI lesion size at day 0, and T2WI lesion size at day 60; 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PWI-derived parameters (time-to-peak [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>], relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV], relative cerebral blood flow [rCBF], and peak height) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tests were bilateral and a p value&lt;0.05 was considered as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Delayed perfusion areas of various size were found within the global perfusion deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High DP/GP ratio values were significantly correlated with: 1. better clinical scores at day 0 and day 60 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;=0.04); 2. smaller lesions at day 0 DWI and at day 60 T2WI (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;=0.004); 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ICA patency (r=0.49, p=0.01); 4. lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> delays, and higher values of rCBV, rCBF, and peak height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that a delayed contrast filling observed on native perfusion-weighted images may be a marker of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow, and may lead to better clinical and morphological outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
