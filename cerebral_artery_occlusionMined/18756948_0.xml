<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of transplantation of immortalized neural progenitor cells (INPCs) into the brain with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the survival and differentiation thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four male SD rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: INPC group undergoing transplantation of BrdU-labeled INPCs into the penumbra zone in striatum using stereotaxic apparatus 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and control group undergoing transplantation of PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological severity score (NSS) system was used 6 hours, 1 day, and 3 days after MCAO, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks respectively after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week after transplantation, 6 animals of each group were randomly chosen and killed with their brains taken out, the rest of the animals were killed four weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival of INPCs in the brain was determined by double immunofluorescent labeling technique with BrdU + NSE or BrdU + GFAP antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NSS values at different time points after transplantation of both groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher than those before MCAO; however, no significant difference in NSS was detected between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BrdU + GFAP and BrdU + NSE positive astrocytes and neurons were detected in the INPC group by double immunofluorescent labeling technique 1 week and 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: INPC can survive in penumbra zone in rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and develop into neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
