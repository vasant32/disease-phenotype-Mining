<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, there is an increase in the enzymatic activity of the calpains, calcium dependent proteases that are thought to contribute to neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, cellular stress due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion also triggers a decrease in protein translation through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we found that methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2), a critical component of the translation initiation complex, is a calpain substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro calpain assays demonstrated that while MetAP2 has autoproteolytic activity, calpain also produces a stable proteolytic fragment at 50kDa using recombinant MetAP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This 50kDa fragment, in addition to a 57kDa fragment was present in in vitro digestions of rat brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Production of these fragments was inhibited by calpastatin, the endogenous and specific inhibitor of calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using an in vivo middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model only the 57kDa fragment of MetAP2 was observed.These data suggest that calpain activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may regulate MetAP2-mediated protein translation giving calpains a larger role in the cellular stress response than previously determined </plain></SENT>
