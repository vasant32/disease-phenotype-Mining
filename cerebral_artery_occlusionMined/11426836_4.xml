<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the work was to evaluate, using an in vivo method, whether GV150526 was able to reduce the extent of ischemic brain damage when administered both before and after (6 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GV150526 was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion weighted (DW) images were acquired at 6, 24 and 144 h after the establishment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic volume was reduced by 84% and 72%, compared to control values, when measured from T2W and DW images, acquired 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ischemic volume was reduced by 48% from control values when measured from T2W images and by 45% when measured from DW images </plain></SENT>
