<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an off-resonance Spin-Locking (SL) scheme for signal preparation is advantageous because the image contrast can be tuned to specific exchange rates by adjusting SL pulse parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>-proton transfer (APT) contrast is obtained optimally with steady-state preparation, using a low power and long irradiation pulse, image contrast from the faster <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-water proton exchange (APEX) is optimized in the transient state with a higher power and a shorter SL pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our phantom experiments show that the APEX contrast is sensitive to protein and amino acid concentration, as well as pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo 9.4-T SL MRI data of rat brains with irradiation parameters optimized to slow exchange rates have a sharp peak at 3.5 ppm and also broad peak at -2 to -5 ppm, inducing negative contrast in APT-weighted images, while the APEX image has large positive signal resulting from a weighted summation of many different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51142">amine-groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> decreases pure APT signal from ~1.7% to ~0%, and increases the APEX signal from ~8% to ~16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model, the APEX signal shows different spatial and temporal patterns with large inter-animal variations compared to APT and water diffusion maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the similarity between the chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and SL techniques, APEX contrast can also be obtained by a CEST approach using similar irradiation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APEX may provide useful information for many diseases involving a change in levels of proteins, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">amino-acids</z:chebi>, or pH, and may serve as a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker </plain></SENT>
