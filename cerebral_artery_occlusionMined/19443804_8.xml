<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TO901317, a synthetic liver X receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, elevates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that TO901317 treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular maturation and improves functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by increasing endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with or without TO901317 (30 mg/kg) starting 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TO901317 significantly increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level, promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular stabilization in the ischemic brain, and improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level significantly correlated with functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TO901317 also increased eNOS phosphorylation in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying the TO901317-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> were investigated using eNOS knockout (eNOS-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TO901317 treatment of eNOS-/- mice significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level but failed to increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that TO901317 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> significantly increased capillary tube formation and promoted eNOS phosphorylation activity in cultured mouse brain endothelial cells compared with nontreatment controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, TO901317 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> treatment-induced capillary tube formation were absent in eNOS-deficient mouse brain endothelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that TO901317 treatment increases serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level, which promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> through eNOS and leads to improvement of functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
