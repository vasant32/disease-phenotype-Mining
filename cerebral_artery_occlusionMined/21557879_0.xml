<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent study reported that cerebroside can open large-conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ (BKCa) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the effects of cerebroside-A (CS-A), a single molecule isolated from an edible mushroom, on brain injury after focal or global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in adult male mice and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We herein report that treatment with CS-A after 60-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> dose-dependently reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with at least a 6-h efficacious time-window, which was partially blocked by the BKCa channel blocker charybdotoxin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CS-A after 20 min global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> (four-vessel occlusion) significantly attenuated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 area, which was also sensitive to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CS-A, by opening the BKCa channel, could prevent excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, CS-A could inhibit NMDAR Ca²⁺ influx, which did not require the activation of the BKCa channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CS-A blocked the OGD-induced NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that treatment with CS-A after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> exerts potent neuroprotection through prevention of excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and reduction of Ca²⁺ influx through NMDARs </plain></SENT>
