<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meteorin (METRN), a newly discovered neurotrophic factor, is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and immature neurons during development, suggesting that it may be involved in neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that METRN promotes migration of neuroblasts from SVZ explants of postnatal rats and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-subjected adult rats via a chemokinetic mechanism, and reduces N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-D-asparate-induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in SVZ cells in vitro </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant METRN infused into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-damaged brain stimulates cell proliferation in SVZ, promotes neuroblast migration, and increases the number of immature and mature neurons in the ischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
