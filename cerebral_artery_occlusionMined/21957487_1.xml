<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well established that free iron increases significantly during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and is responsible for oxidative damage in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increase in iron is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rat model was performed and the mechanism of iron accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of L-ferritin was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum on the ischemic side, whereas H-ferritin was reduced in the striatum and increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of the iron-export protein ferroportin1 (FPN1) significantly decreased, while the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the mechanisms of FPN1 regulation, we studied the expression of the key regulator of FPN1, hepcidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that the hepcidin level was significantly elevated in the ischemic side of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knockdown hepcidin repressed the increasing of L-ferritin and decreasing of FPN1 invoked by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that hepcidin is an important contributor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) were significantly higher in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum on the ischemic side; therefore, the HIF-1α-mediated TfR1 expression may be another contributor to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain </plain></SENT>
