<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the immature brain has tremendous potential for recovery, mechanisms governing repair are essentially unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) early or late after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in postnatal day (P) 10 rats can serve as an intermediate endpoint for long-term studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injured animals selected by diffusion-weighted MRI during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were scanned using T2-weighted MRI at P18 and P25 (injury volumes on MRI and histology were compared) or were subjected to contrast-enhanced MRI at P13 to characterize cerebral microcirculatory disturbances and blood-brain barrier leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injury volume during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not predict histological outcome at 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major reductions in injury volume occurred by P18, with no further changes by P25 and correlated with histological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion was significantly reduced in the injured caudate but blood-brain barrier leakage was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, conventional T2-weighted MRI performed during a subchronic injury phase predicts a long-term histological outcome after experimental neonatal focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
