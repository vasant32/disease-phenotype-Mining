<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a role for the enzyme nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS)-2 in permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is not clear, we examined its expression following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after occlusion, NOS-2 was expressed in cells infiltrating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, while at later times, there was also expression in astrocytes around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To reveal a role for NO derived from this source, we compared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in male and female mice with littermates in which the NOS-2 gene was disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between gender and genotype at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 72 h, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was increased in male mice, but not in females or in either gender with the gene disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NOS-2 plays a role in the later development of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female mice are protected either against the damaging effects of NO, or because NOS-2 expression/activity is modulated by steroids </plain></SENT>
