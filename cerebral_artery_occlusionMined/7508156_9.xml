<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> (1.5 mg/min per kilogram) was infused intravenously to the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> group (n = 14), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was given to the control group (n = 14) for 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each group, regional cerebral blood flow was determined with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine, and arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined by microspectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups regional cerebral blood flow of the ischemic cortex was significantly lower than that of the contralateral cortex ([mean +/- SD] 55 +/- 13 versus 110 +/- 29 mL/min per 100 g in the control group and 35 +/- 13 versus 90 +/- 24 mL/min per 100 g in the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the blood flow in the ischemic cortex of the control group, L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> significantly reduced ischemic blood flow by 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous oxygen saturation was significantly increased in the ischemic cortex (41 +/- 1% versus 44 +/- 3%) but decreased in the contralateral cortex (65 +/- 3% versus 61 +/- 4%) by L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calculated ischemic cortical oxygen consumption in the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> group was 39% lower than that in the corresponding control group, whereas the difference was only 11% in the contralateral sides between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the ratio of oxygen supply to consumption was lower in the ischemic than in the nonischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic cortex, this ratio was significantly lower in the control group than in the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> group (1.7 +/- 0.1 versus 1.9 +/- 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ratio tended to be decreased by L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> in nonischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that despite a decrease in cerebral blood flow, inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthesis mildly improves the oxygen supply and consumption balance in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
