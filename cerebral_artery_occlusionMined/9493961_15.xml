<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transient global or focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> leads to the production of several types of lesions in the DNA backbone including alkali-labile sites, and both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ds breaks result in high molecular weight fragments of 10-50 kbp that contain both 3'- and 5'-OH end-groups, suggesting that more than one endonuclease is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This lesioning of DNA is followed by the appearance of the damage-response indicator Gadd45 in the ischemic hemisphere following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 6 h, gadd45 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was shown to increase by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization histochemistry indicated that these increases in gadd45 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> occurred in pyramidal neurons located on the edge of the infarcted cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gadd45 immunostaining yielded similar findings with maximal protein staining detected at 18 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neurons, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core with frank DNA fragmentation shown by in situ TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) at 24 h, the Gadd45 immunostaining was not visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that Gadd45 responds to DNA damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as part of a repair response mounted by brain cells attempting to survive the insult </plain></SENT>
