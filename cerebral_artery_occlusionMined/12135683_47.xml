<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intravascular administration of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) restores function in animal models of neural injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult MSCs administered intravenously to rat migrate and express neural phenotypes in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms targeting MSC migration into the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), a chemoattractant factor, was measured in rat ischemic brain at various time points after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, using a microchemotaxis chamber, we measured whether ischemic brain tissue extracts induce migration of MSCs and whether brain tissue extracts incubated with antibodies against <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 reduce MSC migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Our data indicate that ischemic brain <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels significantly increase from 6 hours, peak at 48 hours after MCAo (p &lt; 0.05), and thereafter gradually decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue extract at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after MCAo significantly increase MSC migration across the membrane of the microchemotaxis chamber compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the ischemic brain tissue extracts are incubated with antibody against <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, MSC migration is significantly reduced at 24 hours and 48 hours after MCAo compared to extracts without this antibody (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 contributes to MSC migration into the ischemic brain tissue environment </plain></SENT>
