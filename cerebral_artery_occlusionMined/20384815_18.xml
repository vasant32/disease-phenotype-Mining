<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), also called neuronal-specific protein gene product 9.5, is a highly abundant protein in the neuronal cell body and has been identified as a possible biomarker on the basis of a recent proteomic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether UCH-L1 was significantly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following controlled cortical impact (CCI) and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunoblots of rat CSF revealed a dramatic elevation of UCH-L1 protein 48 h after severe CCI and as early as 6 h after mild (30 min) and severe (2 h) MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay constructed to measure UCH-L1 sensitively and quantitatively showed that CSF UCH-L1 levels were significantly elevated as early as 2 h and up to 48 h after CCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, UCH-L1 levels were also significantly elevated in CSF from 6 to 72 h after 30 min of MCAO and from 6 to 120 h after 2 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data are comparable to the profile of the calpain-produced alphaII-spectrin breakdown product of 145 kDa biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, serum UCH-L1 biomarker levels were also significantly elevated after CCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, serum UCH-L1 levels in the 2-h MCAO group were significantly higher than those in the 30-min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data from two rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury strongly suggest that UCH-L1 is a candidate brain injury biomarker detectable in biofluid compartments (CSF and serum) </plain></SENT>
