<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The survival, migration, and differentiation of transplanted human embryonic neural stem cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> post-ischemic environment were characterized and endogenous nestin expression after transplantation was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human embryonic neural stem cells obtained from the temporal lobe cortex were cultured and labeled with fluorescent 1,1'-dioctadecy-6,6'-di (4-sulfopheyl)-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Labeled cells were transplanted into cortical peri-infarction zones of adult rats 24 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival, migration, and differentiation of grafted cells were quantified in immunofluorescence-stained sections from rats sacrificed at 7, 14, and 28 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous nestin-positive cells in the cortical peri-infarction zone were counted at serial time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells transplanted into the cortical peri-infarction zone displayed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of living cells and became widely located around the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some of the transplanted cells expressed nestin, GFAP, or NeuN in the peri-infarction zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, compared with the control group, endogenous nestin-positive cells in the peri-infarction zone had increased significantly 7 days after cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the survival, migration, and differentiation of transplanted cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> post-ischemic environment and enhanced endogenous nestin expression within a brief time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that transplantation of neural stem cells into the peri-infarction zone may be performed as early as 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
