<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The atlas contains 624 carefully delineated brain structures based on the newest (2005) edition of rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An automated procedure, as an SPM toolbox, was introduced for spatially normalizing individual rat brains, conducting statistical analysis and visually localizing the results in the Atlas coordinate space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain template/atlas and the procedure were evaluated using functional images between rats with the right side middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result shows that the brain region with significant signal decline in the MCAO rats was consistent with the occlusion position </plain></SENT>
