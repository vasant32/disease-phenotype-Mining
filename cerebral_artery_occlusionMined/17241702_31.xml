<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of age on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> progression and outcome in order to explore the association between blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption, neuronal damage, and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), young (3 months) and aged (18 months) rats were assessed for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption at 20min post-MCAO, and 24h post-MCAO with tissue plasminogen activator induced reperfusion at 120min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruptions in aged rats occurred early and increased nearly two-fold at both the 20min and 24h time points when compared to young animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage in aged rats was increased two-fold as compared to young rats at 24h, while no neuronal damage was observed at 20min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Young and aged rats exhibited neurological deficits when compared to sham-controls out to 14 days following MCAO and reperfusion; however, aged rats exhibited more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of deficits and prolonged recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that aged rats suffer larger infarctions, reduced functional recovery and increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption preceding observable neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
