<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulation with dabigatran etexilate (DE) has a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for the prevention of ischemic events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> constitutes a strong contraindication for thrombolysis, it is unclear whether patients anticoagulated with DE can be thrombolysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the risk of thrombolysis-associated hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after pretreatment with DE or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine C57BL/6 mice were pretreated orally with 75 mg/kg DE, 112.5mg/kg DE, 2mg/kg <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 hours, administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly before reperfusion, and assessed neurological deficit and HT blood volume after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation increased HT secondary to rt-PA treatment as compared to nonanticoagulated controls (6.9 ± 5.5 μl vs 0.8 ± 0.6 μl, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rate of HT after pretreatment with 75 mg/kg DE, which led to plasma levels comparable to the highest plasma levels observed in participants of the RE-LY trial, did not differ significantly from controls (1.6 ± 0.8; p &gt; 0.05 vs control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a high-dose group receiving 112.5mg/kg DE showed a considerable extent of HT (9.2 ± 5.6 μl, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our experimental data suggest that the risk of thrombolysis-associated HT may not be increased under DE pretreatment with standard doses leading to plasma levels of up to 400 ng/ml, a concentration that was not exceeded in the majority of DE trial patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At higher DE plasma levels, however, the risk of severe HT rises considerably, emphasizing the need for a readily available assay of DE <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
