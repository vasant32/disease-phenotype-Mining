<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion model rats were established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hrs followed with reperfusion for 46 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and at 12th, 24th and 36th hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the rats were administered with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> and aglycone from BYHWD respectively, and nimodipine was given as control medicine to observe the effect of them on protein expression of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 using immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Protein expression of caspase-1 and caspase-3 increased in the injured lateral brain tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caspase-1 expression were observed mainly in choroids, while caspase-3 expression in hippocampus, cortex and medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the four kinds of active fractions from BYHWD could inhibit caspase-1 expression, while nimodipine couldn't </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 expression in hippocampus and medulla could be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi>, that in hippocampus, cortex and medulla could be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> and aglycone, and that in hippocampus and medulla by nimodipine, however, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> showd no effect on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As for caspase-8 expression, no effect on it was shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">Alkaloid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> and aglycone from BYHWD could relieve the inflammatory reaction occurred after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion by inhibiting caspase-1 expression to decrease production of inflammatory cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">Alkaloid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> and aglycone could reduce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by inhibiting caspase-3 expression to antagonize the delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4 kinds of active fractions may be the main material basis for BYHWD in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
