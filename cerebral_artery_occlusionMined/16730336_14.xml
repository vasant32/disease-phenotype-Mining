<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) leads to impaired functional recovery and increased mortality, yet physiological mechanisms are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the roles of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male mice underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and were recovered 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44241">metyrapone</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50692">mifepristone</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg subcutaneously), or vehicle injections on reperfusion days 4-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A separate cohort of mice was implanted with cannulae and was administered IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) or vehicle (6 microg intracerebroventricularly) on reperfusion days 6 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the final injection or infusion, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption was recorded for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice in the sham-treated group consumed significantly more <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> solution than water, whereas MCAO-treated mice consumed similar amounts of each, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo> among MCAO-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A separate experiment assessed whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or IL-1 contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only IL-1ra restored <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption in MCAO-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-MCAO-treated mice drank significantly less <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> solution than did both IL-1ra and vehicle-sham treatment groups, whereas IL-1ra-MCAO-treated mice drank similar amounts to both sham-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo>, a symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in human beings, can be reproduced in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and appears to involve altered IL-1 transmission in the brain </plain></SENT>
