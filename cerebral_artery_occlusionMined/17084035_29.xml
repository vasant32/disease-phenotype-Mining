<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic properties of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on neurons and whether G-CSF affects glial cell survival following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a transient 90 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by the intraluminal occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with either a single dose of G-CSF (50 microg/kg, s.c.) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion or G-CSF (50 microg/kg body weight, s.c.) was administered starting at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion and followed by the administration of the same dose per day for an additional 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested either 24 h, 72 h or 2 weeks after reperfusion for assays of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, immunohistological studies and Western blot analysis for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), Pim-1, bcl-2, Bax, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, cellular inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein 2 (cIAP2), and cleaved caspase-3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-CSF significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ameliorated the early neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-CSF treatment significantly up-regulated pSTAT3, Pim-1, bcl-2 expression, and down-regulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release to the cytosol, Bax translocation to the mitochondria, and cleaved caspase-3 levels in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activation of the STAT3 pathway was accompanied by increased cIAP2 expression in glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After MCAO, G-CSF treatment increased both neuronal and glial survival by effecting different anti-apoptotic pathways which reflects the multifactorial actions of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with remarkable improvement in tissue preservation and behavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
