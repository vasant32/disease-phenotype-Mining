<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence conveys clear suggestions that early reperfusion following at least focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the primate is accompanied by a return of function demonstrably suspended during the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete and permanent arrest of the cerebral circulation has been known within seconds to lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of brain electrical activity, and within minutes to gross disruption of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> energy metabolism with failure of ionic homeostatic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is irreversible cell change and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 5 to 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very much more protracted periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have been shown more recently to be associated with potential viability of neuronal function, and in clinical neurosurgery we have known for years that patients with established cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and a dense neurological deficit may show quite evident improvement over months or years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these protracted recoveries, the potential for re-learning in <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> circuits may play a part, but in more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> circumstances, for example in the progressive recovery from vasospasm, re-learning is clearly not a factor, and this demonstrates quite evidently that neurons at one moment apparently non-functioning, can again within a few minutes recover function even after hours of apparent suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental evidence is fairly well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this symposium and elsewhere we have presented a model of experimental occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in primates demonstrating irreversible recovery of electrical function after some 20 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and reversible recovery of ionic homeostasis after periods of up to an hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
