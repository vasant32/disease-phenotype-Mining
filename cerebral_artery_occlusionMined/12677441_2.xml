<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to determine whether IRF-1 protein is up-regulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and to define the identity of the cells that express IRF-1 in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In mice, IRF-1 immunoreactivity was present in intravascular neutrophils 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 96 h, immunoreactivity was observed in neutrophils infiltrating the ischemic tissue and in neurons at the outer border of the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRF-1 immunoreactivity was also found in neurons and inflammatory cells in the brain of patients who died 1-2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuronal expression of IRF-1, in conjunction with the finding that IRF-1 deletion is beneficial to the post-ischemic brain, suggests that expression of IRF-1-dependent genes in neurons plays a role in ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
