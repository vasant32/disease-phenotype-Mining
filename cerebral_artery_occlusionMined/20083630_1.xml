<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological literatures show an association between air pollution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and effective pollutants may include SO(2), NO(x), O(3), CO, and particulates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, existing experimental studies lack evidence as to the presence of effects for SO(2), which has been the focus in developing countries with increasing use of coal as the main resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we treated Wistar rats with SO(2) at various concentrations and determined endothelin-1 (ET-1), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM-1) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein expression in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that SO(2) elevated the levels of ET-1, iNOS, COX-2, and ICAM-1 mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, we set up rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and further treated the model rats with filtered air and lower concentration SO(2) for the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, elevated expression of ET-1, iNOS, COX-2, and ICAM-1 occurred in the cortex of MCAO model rats exposed to filtered air, followed by increased activation of caspase-3 and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SO(2) inhalation after MCAO significantly amplified above effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It implies that SO(2) inhalation caused brain injuries similar to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and its exposure in atmospheric environment contributed to the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
