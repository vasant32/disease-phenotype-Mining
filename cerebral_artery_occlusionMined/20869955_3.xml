<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Osthole, a natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> derivative, has taken considerable attention because of its diverse pharmacological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported to be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of osthole and its potential mechanisms against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were pretreated with osthole 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg 30 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of osthole against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated by neurological deficit score (NDS), dry-wet weight and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the level of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 after 2h of MCAO in rats were detected to investigate its anti-oxidative action and anti-inflammatory property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with osthole significantly increased in GSH, and decreased the volume of infarction, NDS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, MPO, IL-1β and IL-8 compared with rats in the MCAO group at 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests the neuroprotective effect of osthole in the MCAO model of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-oxidative action and anti-inflammatory property of osthole may contribute to a beneficial effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
