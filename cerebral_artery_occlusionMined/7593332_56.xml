<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in rats while the animals were inside the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tomograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful occlusion was confirmed by the collapse of amplitude on an electrocorticogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ultrafast NMR imaging technique UFLARE was used to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) immediately after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex and caudate-putamen were 726 +/- 22 x 10(-6) mm2/s and 659 +/- 17 x 10(-6) mm2/s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within minutes of occlusion, a large territory with reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> became visible in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the 2 h observation period, this area grew continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction in this region showed a gradual <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease from the periphery to the core, the lowest <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value amounting to about 60% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion, the regional distribution of ATP and tissue pH were determined with bioluminescence and fluorescence techniques, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ATP in the core of the ischemic territory (32 +/- 20% of the hemisphere) and an area of tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> (57 +/- 19% of the hemisphere) spreading beyond that of ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF (rCBF) was measured autoradiographically with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF gradually decreased from the periphery to the ischemic core, where it declined to values as low as 5 ml 100 g-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When reductions in CBF and in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were matched to the corresponding areas of energy breakdown and of tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, the region of energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> corresponded to a threshold in rCBF of 18 +/- 14 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and to an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction to 77 +/- 3% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> corresponded to a flow value below 31 +/- 11 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and to an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value below 90 +/- 4% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the quantification of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the ischemic territory allows the distinction between a core region with total breakdown of energy metabolism and a <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> energy balance but severe tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
