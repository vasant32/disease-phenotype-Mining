<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Re (5, 10 or 20 mg kg(- 1), P.O. for 7 days, once a day) prior to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the neurological symptoms in ischemic animals as compared with the sham group animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects were attenuated by 10 and 20 mg kg(- 1) Re, P.O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in ischemic animals indicating <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An elevated level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in ischemic animals was reduced by 10 and 20 mg kg(- 1) Re, P.O., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was observed that Re significantly decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling, thereby preventing the reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of Re in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
