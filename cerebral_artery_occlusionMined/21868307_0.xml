<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, namely the sham-operated group (S), cerebral I/R model group, ADMA+I/R group, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)+I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter 3 groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury was induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 24-h reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed and the activities of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) and contents of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) were measured using reductase and colorimetric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in the lung tissues were detected with RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of ADMA in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood flowing into and out of the lungs were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral I/R injury caused significantly elevated ADMA levels in the BALF and blood flowing into the lungs, and obviously lowered the NO concentration and NOS activity in the lung tissues (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following cerebral I/R injury, MLCK and PKC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions were significantly upregualted in the lung tissues (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous DDAH obviously decreased the levels of ADMA in the BALF and blood flowing into the lungs, increased NO concentration and NOS activity, and down-regulated MLCK and PKC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions in lung tissues of rats with cerebral I/R injury (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ADMA contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury following cerebral I/R injury in rats by upregulating MLCK and PKC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ADMA may serve as a novel therapeutic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury induced by cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
