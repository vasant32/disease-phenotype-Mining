<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied sequential changes in spontaneous single-unit activities in the ipsilateral SNR 1 h, 1 day, 7 days and 14 days after striatal infarction induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with a sham-operated group, there was no change in the firing rate 1 h after MCAO, and one day after MCAO the mean firing rate decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The firing rate of SNR neurones at 7 and 14 days after MCAO was significantly reduced compared with the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only two neurones (sham-operated group and 1 h after MCAO group) fired with high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed degeneration of the ipsilateral SNR 7 and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
