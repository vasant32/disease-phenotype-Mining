<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry is a well-established method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this technique has not been applied to the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish a flow cytometric method to measure inflammatory cells in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To perform flow cytometry on brain tissue, we developed 2 cell-isolation methods based on different mechanical dissociation and Percoll gradient separation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methods were tested on a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunophenotypic analyses, with the use of anti-CD11b, anti-CD45, and alphabeta T-cell receptor antibodies, were employed to identify and quantify inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both methods gave consistent results in terms of yield and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cell suspension contained granulocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunophenotypic analyses enabled the identification of a cell-scatter gate (R1a) enriched in inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With both methods, a higher number of events in R1a were recorded in the ischemic hemisphere than in the nonischemic hemisphere (P&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD11b, CD45, and alphabeta T-cell receptor staining confirmed that this augmentation was a reflection of the increase in the number of granulocytes, cells of the monocytic lineage, and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative flow cytometric analysis of ischemic rat brain is feasible and provides a reliable and rapid assay to assess neuroinflammation in experimental models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
