<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the regional blood to brain transfer coefficient of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> was determined in eight <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transfer coefficient (microliter/min-1/g-1) was significantly higher in the ischaemic cortex (10.6 +/- 2.3) than in the contralateral cortex (6.5 +/- 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral regional capillary surface area was determined in another group of twelve rats using an alkaline phosphatase stain for the total capillary bed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> to visualize the perfused capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfused capillary surface area (cm2/cm3) was lower in the ischaemic cortex (141 +/- 31) than in the contralateral cortex (426 +/- 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these values for the transfer coefficient, surface area and our previously published data of regional cerebral blood flow after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we calculated the extraction fraction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi>, the permeability-surface area product and the permeability of cerebral regional capillary beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although, there are numerous reports of permeability-surface area product of brain capillaries, to our knowledge, the permeability has never been determined before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calculated extraction fraction ratio for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> for ischaemic cortex/contralateral cortex was 3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar ratios for permeability-surface area product and capillary permeability were 1.6 and 4.4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, there was a more than four fold increase in capillary permeability to small molecules in the ischaemic cortex one hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
