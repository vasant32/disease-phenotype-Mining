<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Weak staining for these protein kinases was found in both cortical and caudate neurons in sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staining for Akt-1 and PI3-K was increased at 3-8 h in the ischemic penumbral region and declined at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A slight induction of these kinases was observed in the ischemic core region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Robust expression of ERK was noted at 3-8 h in most neurons in the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, ERK continued to be expressed in the ischemic penumbra, but decreased in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the signaling for Akt and PI3-K are different from the ERK dependent signal transduction during ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
