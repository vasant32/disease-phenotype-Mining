<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As drugs for treating this type of injury have shown poor efficacy and adverse side effects in clinical trials, a novel therapeutic strategy has been long awaited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on the disruption of the blood-brain barrier after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and applied a liposomal drug delivery system (DDS) designed to enhance the pharmacological effect of the neuroprotectant and to avoid side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PEGylated liposomes were injected at varying time after the start of reperfusion in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed PEGylated liposomes accumulated in the ischemic hemisphere at an early stage after reperfusion and were retained in the lesion for at least 24h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the effectiveness of asialo-erythropoietin (AEPO)-modified PEGylated liposomes (AEPO-liposomes) in treating the cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AEPO-liposome treatment significantly reduced TTC-defined cerebral legion following cerebral I/R injury, and ameliorated motor function compared with vehicle and AEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results indicate that AEPO-liposomes are a promising liposomal formulation for protecting the brain from I/R injury, and that this liposomal DDS has potential as a novel strategy for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
