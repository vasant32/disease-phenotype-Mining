<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MLN519 has previously been reported to decrease ischemic brain injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors used higher doses of MLN519 to evaluate the neuroprotection therapeutic window after 24 hours of brain injury in rats as correlated to proteasome levels, activated NF-kappaB immunoreactivity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLN519 or vehicle was administered after injury with a single injection given in delayed increments of 2 hours (i.e., 4, 6, or 8 hours after MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MLN519 up to 6 hours after MCAO (4 hours after reperfusion) effectively reduced neuronal and astrocytic degeneration, decreased cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and increased neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were related to &gt;80% reductions in blood proteasome levels, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and a decrease in activated NF-kappaB immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This improved neuroprotection profile and antiinflammatory effect of MLN519 provides an exciting avenue for potential treatment of focal ischemic brain injury in humans </plain></SENT>
