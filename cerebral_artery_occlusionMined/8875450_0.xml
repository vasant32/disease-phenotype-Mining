<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of nilvadipine (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi>-type calcium entry blocker) on the cerebral circulation, experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were used to measure abrupt changes in the cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the 'penumbra' (the boundary region between the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in Sprague--Dawley rats, and then 8 or 16 micrograms kg-1 of nilvadipine was administered to two groups of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former group was referred to as the 8-MCAO(+) group (n = 8), and the latter group, the 16-MCAO(+) group (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To a control group (n = 8), only the solvent of nilvadipine was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the administration in each group, CBF and the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were continuously measured for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MAP in both the 8-MCAO(+) and 16-MCAO(+) groups was significantly lower than in the control group for 25 min after nilvadipine administration (Wilcoxon 2 sample test, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the CBF in the 16-MCAO(+) group was significantly lower (about 20%) for 55 minutes than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the CBF in the 8-MCAO(+) group three minutes after nilvadipine administration was not significantly lower than in the control group (Wilcoxon 2 sample test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirmed that nilvadipine (8 micrograms kg-1) maintained CBF while lowering the blood pressure in the experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
