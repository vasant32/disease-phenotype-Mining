<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In this study the authors tested the hypothesis that the estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water is a reliable pathophysiological index of the viability of ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CMRO2 and CMRglc, respectively) were measured using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scanning before and after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or reperfusion in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value, which was measured using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging was compared with physiological variables obtained by PET scanning and with histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After both permanent MCAO and reperfusion, the decrease in the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was significantly correlated with decrease in the CMRO2 and CMRglc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarction coincided with a CMRO2 threshold of 50% of the value measured on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value of 80% or 75% of the contralateral value reflected the CMRO2 threshold after permanent MCAO or reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, lesions with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values above 80% of the contralateral value are potentially reversible until 6 hours after MCAO, whereas lesions with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values below 75% of the contralateral value are irreversible as early as 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of water provides a reliable pathophysiological index for tailoring therapy to the condition of individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
