<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increases in sympathetic activity and frequency of myocardial damage occur after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in Wistar rats, while MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) decreases sympathoadrenal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autonomic changes have been suggested to result from damage to the insular cortex (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A lesion of the IC was made using the excitotoxin D,L-homocysteic acid (DLH; 1 mol/L), in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized Wistar rats and SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, renal sympathetic nerve discharge (SND), ECG, and plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> were measured in 14 SHRs and 14 Wistar male rats after a 500-nL injection of DLH or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological examination showed that DLH resulted in neuronal damage throughout the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DLH injection initially elevated MAP (at approximately 10 minutes after injection) in Wistar rats but not in SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 hours after the DLH injection, there was a secondary, longer-term increase in MAP in the Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAP decreased in the SHRs after IC lesion such that at 6 hours, lesioned SHRs had a MAP that was significantly lower than that of sham-lesioned SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SND initially increased (at 10 minutes) after DLH injection in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the SHRs, SND decreased significantly from the initial values, by 3 hours after DLH injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels were not significantly changed as a result of IC lesion in the Wistar rats or the SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Heart rates increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, with no differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in the ECG or in the frequency of cardiac myocytolysis in either strain (sham or lesioned animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IC lesion in the SHR and Wistar rat therefore appears to result in autonomic changes similar to that seen after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unlike MCAO, however, the autonomic changes do not appear to be sufficient to produce myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
