<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on the activation of astrocytes (AST) in the periinfarct region after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as well as to evaluate potential behavioural improvement after EA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, model and EA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats in each group were further divided into 7, 14 and 28 days sub-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was established, followed by 7, 14 or 28 days of EA on 'Bai hui' and 'Da zhui' acupoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of GFAP-immunoreactive cells was determined and behavioural tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many more GFAP-immunoreactive cells were detected in the EA group on day 14 than on day 7 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and a slightly decreased number of immunoreactive cells were observed on day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of behavioural tests of animals in the EA group on the beam balance performance and prehensile traction performance were superior to that of animals in the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that EA has the potential to activate AST in the periinfarct region and to avoid excess reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and also can facilitate the recovery of post-ischemic behavioural dysfunction </plain></SENT>
