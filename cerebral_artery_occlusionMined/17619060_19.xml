<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 60 min followed by reperfusion for 7 days was employed in present study to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion induced cerebral injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment of cognitive behaviour was done using elevated plus maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment of neurological severity score was employed to assess motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests in a composite manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adhesive-removal somatosensory test was employed to evaluate somatosensory deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial occlusion of middle cerebral artery markedly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired memory</z:e>, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions as inferred from the results of elevated plus-maze test, adhesive-removal test and neurological severity score test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of amniotic fluid derived stem cells/embryonic neuronal stem cells significantly reversed the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion induced behavioural deficit measured in terms of loss of short-term memory, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be concluded that stem cells derived from amniotic fluid exert beneficial effect on the ischaemic brain to an extent comparable to the neuroprotective effect of embryonic neuronal stem cells </plain></SENT>
