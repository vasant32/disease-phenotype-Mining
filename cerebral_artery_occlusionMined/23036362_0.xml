<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lanthionines are novel neurotrophic and neuroprotective small molecules that show promise for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, a recently developed, cell permeable lanthionine derivative known as LKE (lanthionine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33272">ketimine</z:chebi> 5-ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>) promotes neurite growth at low nanomolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LKE also has neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its therapeutic potential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and its mechanisms of neurotrophic action remain to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective actions of LKE could result from induction or modulation of CRMP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that treating primary cultured mouse neurons with LKE provided significant protection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">t-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> possibly through CRMP2 upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in vivo studies showed that LKE pre and/or post-treatment protects mice against permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p-MCAO) as evidenced by lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions and improved functional outcomes in terms of rotarod, grip strength and neurologic deficit scores in treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein expression levels of CRMP2 were higher in brain cortices of LKE pretreated mice, suggesting that LKE's neuroprotective activity may be CRMP2 dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower activity of cleaved PARP-1 and higher activity of SIRT-1 was also observed in LKE treated group suggesting its anti-apoptotic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that LKE has potential as a therapeutic intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that part of its protective mechanism may be attributed to CRMP2 mediated action and PARP-1/SIRT-1 modulation </plain></SENT>
