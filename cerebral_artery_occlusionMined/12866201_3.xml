<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery by the application of electro-acupuncture (EA) on different acupoints was investigated using a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acupoints were Baihui (D20) plus Renzhong (D26) (MCAO + D group), and Hanyan (G4), Xuanlu (G5), Xuanli (G6), plus Qubin (G7) (MCAP + G group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals with EA treatment showed significant functional improvements from 12 days after the reperfusion against those without EA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among EA treated groups, MCAO + G showed a more significant recovery than MCAO + D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume revealed the significant reduction in the EA treated groups especially in MCAO + G at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed a remarkable induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in astrocytes of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at 30 days, more in EA treated groups than in groups treated with MCAO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the acupoints applied in this study are effective for the functional recovery, and an enhanced expression of VEGF may play a certain role in recovery process after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
