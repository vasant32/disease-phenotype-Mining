<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> is a most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> causing major negative social and economic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the effect of PACAP38 injection intracerebroventrically in a mouse model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) along with corresponding SHAM control that used 0.9% saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ischemic and non-ischemic brain tissues were sampled at 6 and 24 hours post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following behavioral analyses to confirm whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has occurred, we investigated the genome-wide changes in gene and protein expression using DNA microarray chip (4x44K, Agilent) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) coupled with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining were also used to further examine the identified protein factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results revealed numerous changes in the transcriptome of ischemic hemisphere (ipsilateral) treated with PACAP38 compared to the saline-injected SHAM control hemisphere (contralateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previously known (such as the interleukin family) and novel (Gabra6, Crtam) genes were identified under PACAP influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, 2-DGE analysis revealed a highly expressed protein spot in the ischemic hemisphere that was identified as dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DPYL2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DPYL2, also known as Crmp2, is a marker for the axonal growth and nerve development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PACAP treatment slightly increased its abundance (by 2-DGE and immunostaining) at 6 h but not at 24 h in the ischemic hemisphere, suggesting PACAP activates neuronal defense mechanism early on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed inventory of PACAP influenced gene expressions and protein targets in mice ischemic brain, and suggests new targets for thereaupetic interventions </plain></SENT>
