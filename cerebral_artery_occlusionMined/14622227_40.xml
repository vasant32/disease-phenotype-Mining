<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of three models of permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as well as cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, on behaviour and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats received a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> either by devascularization or by two different procedures of medial cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; small vs. large) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were trained in a reaching task, forepaw asymmetry, forepaw inhibition, sunflower seed task and tongue extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behaviour was assessed 1 week after the lesion and at 2-week intervals for a total of 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week after the surgery <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were severely impaired on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tasks and although they improved over time they only reached preoperative base lines on tongue extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals with small MCAOs performed better in reaching and sunflower tasks; no other behavioural differences were detected among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pyramidal cells in forelimb and cingulate areas as well as spiny neurons of the striatum were examined for dendritic branching and spine density using a Golgi-Cox procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each lesion type had a different impact on cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, different changes (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) were observed with each kind of lesion and these changes were specific for the region (forelimb, cingulate, striatum) and the condition (intact vs. damaged hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that: (i) different lesions to the motor cortex produce subtle differences in behaviour, and (ii) the method used to induce the lesion produces striking differences in cortical and subcortical plasticity </plain></SENT>
