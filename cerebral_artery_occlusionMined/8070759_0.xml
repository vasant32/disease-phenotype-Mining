<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Zuzhongping group (n = 9), (2) Saline control group (n = 10), and (3) Blank control group (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 and group 2 received via a gastric tube 1 1ml/kg/day of Zuzhongping and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral middle arteries on the right side of 28 rats were occluded with a bipolar electro-coagulater at sites 1-2 mm from the right olfactory nerve tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic volumes were measured by an image analytic system when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> had lasted 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the ischemic volume of Zuzhongping group was significantly smaller than that of group 2 and group 3, suggesting a protective effect of Zuzhongping </plain></SENT>
