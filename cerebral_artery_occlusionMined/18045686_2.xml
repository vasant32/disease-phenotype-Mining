<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female rats were allocated to normothermia (37 degrees C) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) treatments during a 60 min microclip middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesions were visualized after observation periods of 2 or 7 days and the concentration of galanin measured by radioimmunoassay in extracts of punch biopsies from both the lesioned and the contralateral control hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elevated galanin levels were predominantly found in the non-ischemic control hemisphere, in the hippocampus, thalamus and the posterior part of parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The galanin concentrations were lower in the ischemic hemisphere in both the normo- and hypothermic animals compared to the corresponding contra lateral intact hemisphere (p=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factor of time, 2 respectively 7 days, did not show any significant difference regarding the galanin concentrations (p=0.844) </plain></SENT>
