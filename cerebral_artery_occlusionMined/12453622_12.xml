<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used a rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model to examine the distribution of neuregulin after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found an increase in immunohistochemical staining for neuregulin in the penumbral regions of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in neuregulin appeared to be neuronal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no neuregulin co-localization with astrocytes or macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that neuregulin is induced in neurons following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and may be involved in neuroprotection and repair </plain></SENT>
