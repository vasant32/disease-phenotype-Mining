<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (Lac) as determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, water diffusion, and T(1rho) were quantified as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lac concentrations were used to estimate intracellular pH (pH(i)) in the brain during the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease in APTR during occlusion indicated acidification from 7.1 to 6.79 +/- 0.19 (a drop by 0.3 +/- 0.2 pH units), whereas pH(i) computed from Lac concentration was 6.3 +/- 0.2 (a drop by 0.8 +/- 0.2 pH units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the disagreement between the two methods in terms of the size of the change in the absolute pH(i) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, DeltaAPTR and pH(i) (and Lac concentration) displayed a strong correlation during the MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion and T(1rho) indicated cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; however, APTR returned slowly toward the values determined in the contralateral hemisphere post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data argue that the APTR during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is affected not only by pH(i) but by other physicochemical factors as well, and indicates different aspects of pathology in the post-ischemic brain compared to those that influence water diffusion and T(1rho) </plain></SENT>
