<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The research is to study the inhibitory effect of HSYA on the inflammatory signal transduction pathway related factors which were induced by permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using the successive administration at a 30 min interval of HSYA and the rats permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model established by a intraluminal suture occlusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, cortex was removed for the next experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was used to detect the expression of p65 protein and the phospho-IkappaB-alpha (pIkappaB-alpha) in the cytoplasm and nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity was measured by Trans-AM transcription factor assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 was measured by the RT-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result showed that intravenous injection of HSYA (10 mg x kg(-1)) to rats after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusion</z:e>, the p65 translocation activity and the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha were significantly inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, HSYA suppressed p65 binding activity and the transcriptional level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, and promoted the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the anti-cerebral ischemic mechanism of HSYA may be due to its inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of cytokines in the inflammatory transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
