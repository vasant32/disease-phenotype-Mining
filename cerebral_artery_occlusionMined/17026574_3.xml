<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most test arrays available are either expensive and/or sensitive to environmental disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an extensive training phase for experimental animals is often required by conventional tests to get reproducible data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a new test array, the Stairway, that is robust, cost-effective, and needs only a minimum training phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its efficiency is evaluated in comparison to the well-established RotaRod and modified neurological severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical cord blood transplantation (n = 18) was performed 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by intravenous injection of suspended cells in comparison to control injections (n = 18), while behavioral assessment was carried out continuously for 29 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, development of lesions was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results reveal the Stairway test as a simple, highly reproducible, and easy manageable test system thus reflecting therapeutic benefits precisely </plain></SENT>
