<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of aloe <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> on caspase-3 expression following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (16 rats in each group): aloe <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi>, ginkgo leaf tablet, nimodipine, model and sham surgery groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were administered the appropriate drug or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline for 7 days by gavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury was established using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in the cerebral cortex were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that caspase-3 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in the cerebral cortex in the aloe <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi>, ginkgo leaf tablet and nimodipine groups were significantly lower compared with the model group and were higher than the sham surgery group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in caspase-3 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression among the aloe <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi>, the ginkgo leaf tablet and the nimodipine groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aloe <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> has a protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that may be due to the inhibition of neuronal cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
