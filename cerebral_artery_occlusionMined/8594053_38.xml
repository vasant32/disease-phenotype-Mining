<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three days before the imposition of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> CSDs were elicited by applying <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> (KC1) for 2 h through a microdialysis probe implanted in the occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control animals were handled identically except that saline was infused instead of KC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by the intraluminal suture method and cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced from 124.8 +/- 49.5 mm(3) in the controls to 62.9 +/- 59.5 mm(3) in the animals preconditioned with CSD (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two groups in the subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or in CBF, measured by the hydrogen clearance method, during or immediately after the ischemic interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that preconditioning CSD applied 3 days before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may increase the brain's resistance to focal ischemic damage and may be used as a model to explore the neuroprotective molecular responses of neuronal and glial cells </plain></SENT>
