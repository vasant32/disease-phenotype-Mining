<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that Aβ and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_36'>calcium deposition</z:mpath>, and β-secretase activity, are robustly increased in the ipsilateral thalamus after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether the non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi>, which also inhibits β-secretase cleavage of APP, affects thalamic accumulation of Aβ and calcium and in turn influences functional recovery in rats subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 27-day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> treatment (50 mg/kg, p.o.) initiated 2 days after MCAO significantly decreased the levels of soluble Aβ40, Aβ42 and calcium in the ipsilateral thalamus, as compared with vehicle-treated MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of seladin-1/DHCR24 protein, which is a potential protective factor against neuronal damage, was decreased at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> treatment restored seladin-1/DHCR24 expression in the ipsilateral thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">Bepridil</z:chebi> treatment did not significantly affect <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase-1-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> treatment mitigated MCAO-induced alterations in APP processing in the ipsilateral thalamus and improved contralateral forelimb use in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> is a plausible therapeutic candidate in AD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> owing to its multifunctional role in key cellular events that are relevant for the pathogenesis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
