<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mildronate (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi>) is an inhibitor of l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> biosynthesis and an anti-ischemic drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of mildronate in rats following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 90min, followed by the intraperitoneal administration of mildronate at doses of 100 and 200mg/kg 2h after reperfusion and then daily for an additional 14days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The beam-walking, rota-rod and cylinder tests were used to assess sensorimotor function, and vibrissae-evoked forelimb-placing and limb-placing tests examined responses to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following behavioural testing, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebellar concentrations of l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>, Î³-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16244">butyrobetaine</z:chebi> (GBB) and mildronate were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that saline-treated MCAO rats had minor or no spontaneous recovery in sensorimotor and proprioceptive function up to 14days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with mildronate at a dose of 200mg/kg was found to accelerate recovery of motor and proprioceptive deficits in limb-placing, cylinder and beam-walking tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of rat cerebellar tissue extracts revealed that l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> and GBB concentrations changed with mildronate treatment; the concentration of l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> was significantly decreased by mildronate treatment, whereas the concentration of GBB was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar concentrations of mildronate also increased in a dose-dependent manner following systemic administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size did not differ among the experimental groups on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that mildronate treatment improves the functional outcome in MCAO rats without influencing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
