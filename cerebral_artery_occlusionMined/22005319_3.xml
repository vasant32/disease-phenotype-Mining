<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that newborn striatal neurons can functionally integrate with local neural networks in adult rat brain after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined whether these newly generated striatal neurons can develop projections to the substantia nigra, a target of striatal projection neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and a retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) combined with multiple immunostaining labels of newborn striatal neurons, and nigral microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">fluorogold</z:chebi> (FG) to trace the striatonigral projection in adult rat brain at different weeks following a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that FG positive (FG(+)) cells could be detected in newly generated neurons (BrdU(+)-NeuN(+) and GFP(+)-NeuN(+)) in ipsilateral striatum clearly at 12, but not 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced newborn striatal projection neurons could form long axons that targeted the substantia nigra (striatonigral projection pathway) and that have intact axonal transport from the nerve terminal to cell body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These new striatal neurons express <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51146">NR2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D2L receptors, which form the molecular basis for responding to the inputs from cortical glutamatergic and nigral dopaminergic projection neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data provide the first morphological evidence that newborn neurons in the striatum, a non-neurogenic region, can establish new striatonigral neural circuits, important pathways for the maintenance of motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results help us to understand endogenous cellular mechanisms of brain repair, and suggest that increasing adult neurogenesis could be a practical strategy for enhancing the efficacy of rehabilitative therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
