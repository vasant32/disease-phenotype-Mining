<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore this mechanism, oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic processes were evaluated in the striatum of adult rats using a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R), either with or without dapsone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were submitted to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hr, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were dosed either with dapsone (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 30 min before or 30 min after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LP) and nitrotyrosine contents were measured 22 hr after reperfusion, and myeloperoxidase activity was evaluated 46 hr after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different markers for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were also evaluated both at 24 and 72 hr after I/R experimental procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LP increased by 37% in ischemic animals vs controls, and this effect was reversed by dapsone treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was observed regarding nitrotyrosine striatal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, increased 3.7-fold in ischemic animals vs. control rats, and dapsone treatment antagonized that effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was increased by the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at both evaluation times, dapsone antagonized that effect only at 72 hr after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dapsone antagonized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the I/R end points measured, showing a remarkable ability to decrease markers of damage through <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, antiinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
