<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> damage play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore BBR's effect in ischemic injury and the role of the Akt/GSK (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase) signaling cascade in mediating the anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and anti-inflammatory effects in the rat brain of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to pMCAO and randomly assigned into four groups: Sham (sham-operated) group, pMCAO (pMCAO+0.9% saline) group, BBR-L (pMCAO+BBR 10 mg/kg) and BBR-H (pMCAO+BBR 40 mg/kg) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BBR was administered immediately after pMCAO and the neuroprotection was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phospho-Akt (pAkt), phospho-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3-β (pGSK3β), phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and claudin-5 in ischemic cerebral cortex were detected by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with pMCAO group, BBR dramatically lessened neurological deficits scores, brain water contents and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes, upregulated the expression of pAkt, pGSK3β, pCREB and claudin-5, and decreased the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB (P&lt;0.05) in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that BBR reduced ischemic brain injury after pMACO, and this effect may be via the increasing the activation of Akt/GSK signaling and claudin-5, and decreasing NF-κB expression </plain></SENT>
