<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that infusion of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) stimulates stem and progenitor cell proliferation, migration, and neuronal differentiation associated with the amelioration of neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But the use of TGF-alpha in humans is impeded by impracticality of intracranial infusion and the inability of intravenous TGF-alpha to cross the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether intranasal delivery of PEGylated TGF-alpha (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-TGF-alpha) is a viable alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that intranasal <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-TGF-alpha can also induce the proliferation of neural progenitors and their migration to the damaged striatum, and that this is associated with significant behavioral improvement in the MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This nonsurgical approach represents a potential therapeutic strategy for human patients </plain></SENT>
