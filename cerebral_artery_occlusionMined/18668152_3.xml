<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transient right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-serum deprivation for 2 h as the model of ischemic injury in vivo and in vitro, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate location of P2Y(1) receptor and GDNF, the expression of GFAP and GDNF, and the changes of signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blockage of P2Y(1) receptor with the selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> N(6)-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16335">deoxyadenosine</z:chebi> 3',5'-bisphosphate diammonium (MRS2179) reduced GFAP production and increased GDNF production in the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> group as compared with simple ischemic group both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-serum deprivation and blockage of P2Y(1) receptor caused elevation of phosphorylated Akt and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and reduction of phosphorylated Janus kinase2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3, Ser727) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After blockage of P2Y(1) receptor and deprivation of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-serum, AG490 (inhibitor of JAK2) reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Ser727) as well as expression of GFAP; LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), decreased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB; the inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase1/2 (MEK1/2) U0126, an important molecule of Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, decreased the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3 (Ser727), Akt and CREB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that P2Y(1) receptor plays a role in the production of GFAP and GDNF in astrocytes under transient ischemic condition and the related signaling pathways may be JAK2/STAT3 and PI3-K/Akt/CREB, respectively, and that crosstalk probably exists between them </plain></SENT>
