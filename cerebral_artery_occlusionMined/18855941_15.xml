<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> protects neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> intravenously (10 mg/kg) at 30 min, 3 hr, or 6 hr after MCAO reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes to 21.2+/-6.7%, 14.5+/-3.0%, and 22.8+/-2.9%, respectively, of that of the untreated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> was evident when it was administered as late as 9 hr after MCAO/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neuroprotective effects were accompanied by improvement of motor impairment and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>-treated brain was found to show marked repressions of microglia activation, neutrophil infiltration, and proinflammatory marker expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> suppressed NF-kappaB activity dose-dependently in the postischemic brain and also in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-treated primary microglia and neutrophil cultures, suggesting that NF-kappaB activity inhibition explains in part its anti-inflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that curative treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> affords strong protection against delayed cerebral ischemic injury, and that these neuroprotective effects might be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
