<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after 1 h of occlusion, significantly less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evident in cerebral cortex, but not in striatum, in ORP150TG than ORP150KO mice (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical reactivity for microtubule-associated protein (MAP)2 in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was lost in ORP150KO mice at 24 h after 1 h of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MAP2 staining still was present in the affected cortex of ORP150TG mice, where markedly enhanced ORP150 immunoreactivity was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAP2 staining had disappeared from the affected area at 24 h after 3 h of occlusion in both groups, but astrocytic ORP150 reactivity was preserved in the ORP150TG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 h after 1-h occlusion, when MAP2 staining was evident in the affected cortex, some cortical neurons of the TG mice were reactive for Bcl-xS/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ORP150 may be cytoprotective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury via reduction of ER stress and probably also inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
