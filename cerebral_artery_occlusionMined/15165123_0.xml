<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3-NPA at a dose of 20 mg/kg or vehicle control was intraperitoneally into the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days later, rats were exposed to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolinm <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cerebral ischemic penumbra was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry methods (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that as compared to the vehicle-treated group, pretreatment with 3-NPA could reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 23.3% and decrease the number of TUNEL-positive neural cells and apoptotic percentage by 47% (P&lt;0.05) and 44.9% (P&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the development of 3-NPA-induced ischemic tolerance in brain might be related to the decreases in neural cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
