<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ER stress-related markers [immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP)/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein (GRP) 78, activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP)] in the striatum and the cortex were investigated after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated indicator (ERAI) transgenic mice, which show splicing of X-box protein 1 (XBP-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as green fluorescence, we monitored the regional changes in fluorescence after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BiP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] analysis) was increased in the cortex at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemical and/or Western blot analysis, the expressions of ER stress-related markers (BiP, ATF-4, and CHOP) were increased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, more strongly in the cortex than in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ERAI fluorescence was observed in the ischemic area starting from 6 and 12 h, respectively, after MCAO, with the peaks at 1 day and the fluorescence co-localized with the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-visible extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that permanent MCAO induces expression of ER-stress related genes mainly in the periphery of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
