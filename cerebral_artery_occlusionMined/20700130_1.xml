<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Lewis rats subjected to 3 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), plasma concentrations of α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> rapidly decreased and returned to baseline over the course of days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exogenous administration of α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> (100 or 500 μg/kg) improved 24 hour outcome in animals subjected to 2 hours MCAO; α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> 500 μg/kg also decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both doses of α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> were ineffective in improving outcome or decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in animals subjected to 3 hours MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The splenocyte response to phytohemagglutin in animals treated with α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> was attenuated at 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 month after MCAO, treatment with α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> 500 μg/kg at the time of stoke was associated with a decrease in TH1 response to myelin basic protein (MBP) in animals subjected to 2 hours MCAO, although treatment was not associated with improved outcome at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the early benefits of α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> treatment and its effect on immunologic outcome, further studies to evaluate the utility of α-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are warranted </plain></SENT>
