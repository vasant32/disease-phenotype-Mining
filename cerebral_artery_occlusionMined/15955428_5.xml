<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the possible involvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) in the therapeutic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by electro-acupuncture (EA) using the rat model with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, the changes of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> expression level in the primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and its penumbral regions were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and survival neuron percentages were also assessed using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stained sections after picrotoxin (PTX) injection, a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> receptor's <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that EA markedly decreased the ischemic damaged areas in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant to this was an up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> immunoexpression in MCAO rats with EA treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, injection of PTX in rats subjected to MCAO or MCAO followed by EA treatment increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and decreased survival cell percentage significantly when compared with those without PTX injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the light of these findings, it is suggested that EA on specific and established acupoints that are commonly used in clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may have elicited an up-regulated expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> that would have a neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
