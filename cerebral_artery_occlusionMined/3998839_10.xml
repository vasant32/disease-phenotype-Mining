<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chief among these are the regional development of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, decreased local perfusion, altered neuronal function, and eventual infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if pretreatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, would result in improvement in these parameters, adult cats were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or control solvent (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily) and were studied for periods up to 24 hours after right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> was also examined in separate groups of experimental animals using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and ketamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cats allowed to recover from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> reduced gray and white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at 6 and 24 hours after occlusion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was noted in densely areas (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> = 84.3%, control = 87.5%), "penumbra" regions (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> = 82.5%, control = 85.3%), and in nonischemic zones (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> = 81.5%, control = 82.3%) at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potential amplitude and central latency were also improved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> group (p less than 0.05), as was cerebral perfusion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals anesthetized with continuous ketamine administration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and perfusion as well as evoked potentials were not significantly improved in any region by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow in the group was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> in the nonischemic opposite hemisphere (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> = 64.7 cc/100 gm/min, control = 48.5 cc/100 gm/min, p less than 0.05), but not in the penumbra region of the ischemic hemisphere (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> = 15.0 cc/100 gm/min, control = 18.6 cc/100 gm/min, p less than 0.05), when measured 4 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggested a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> were evident in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, but not after ketamine anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests a synergism dependent on decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> production from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-stabilized membranes coupled with diminished production of cyclic endoperoxides from available <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> due to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
