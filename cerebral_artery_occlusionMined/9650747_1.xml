<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated protein synthesis in the remote areas of rats exposed to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proximal portion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was permanently occluded, and at various periods (6 h, 2, 4 and 7 days and 2 and 4 weeks following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) animals received a single dose of L-[2,3-3H]valine (6.7 mCi/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain sections containing the thalamus and SN were processed for autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and striatum, marked impairment of protein synthesis was observed and was never completely recovered during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No changes in protein synthesis in the ipsilateral thalamus were detected during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a change in protein synthesis was demonstrated in the ipsilateral SN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, incorporation of [3H]valine into the whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> reticulata of the ipsilateral SN was slightly enhanced and the increase became evident at 4 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased incorporation of [3H]valine began to be localized in the lateral portion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> reticulata after 7 days and continued up to 4 weeks following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhanced protein synthesis during the early stage (2 and 4 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) may be due to the activated function of the neurons in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> reticulata and that during the late stage (7 days and 2 and 4 weeks) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to astroglial proliferation </plain></SENT>
