<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on its trophic influence on neurons and vascular cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VEGF's survival-promoting effects are purchased at the expense of an increased blood brain barrier permeability, which potentially compromises tissue survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms via which VEGF protects the brain against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined signaling pathways underlying VEGF's neuroprotective activity in our transgenic mouse line, which expresses human VEGF165 under a neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1) is expressed on ischemic neurons and astrocytes and is activated by VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following 90-min episodes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, VEGF increased phosphorylated (but not total) Akt and ERK-1/-2 and reduced phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase/p38 and c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/-2 levels, at the same time decreasing inducible NO synthase expression in ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Akt with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> reversed VEGF's neuroprotective properties, diminished <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, and restored the vascular permeability induced by VEGF to below levels in WT animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aggravation of brain injury by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> was associated with the restitution of p38, but not of JNK-1/-2, ERK-1/-2, or inducible NOS (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that VEGF mediates both neuroprotection and blood brain barrier permeability via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our observation that VEGF neuroprotection and vascular leakage depend on PI3K/Akt, which is putatively regulated by VEGF receptor-2, we predict that it may not easily be possible to make use of VEGF's neuroprotective function without accepting its unfavorable consequence, the <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
