<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, administration of high-dose erythropoietin has potential complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether local infusion of low dose erythropoietin offers neuroprotective effects after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats subject to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were randomly divided into three groups: (1) sham group: the rats received the same procedure as the other two groups except that no suture was inserted; (2) vehicle group: intra-artery local infusion of saline was administered via middle cerebral artery after reperfusion; and (3) treatment group: 50 U/kg intra-artery local infusion of erythropoietin was administered via middle cerebral artery after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining) were evaluated 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was measured through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase were investigated by immunohistochemistry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results show that intra-artery local infusion of erythropoietin, via the middle cerebral artery, significantly reduced neurological deficit scores, foot fault number, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions were also found in the number of positive cells stained by TUNEL assay within the ischemic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, local infusion of erythropoietin increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Local infusion of low-dose erythropoietin via the middle cerebral artery is shown to be neuroprotective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of neuroprotection may be associated with the increased expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
