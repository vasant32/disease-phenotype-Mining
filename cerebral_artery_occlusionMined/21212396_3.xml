<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) decrease neurological deficits in rodents after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and concomitantly induce extensive neurite remodeling in the brain, which highly correlates with the improvement of neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on neurite remodeling after BMSC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult C57BL/6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice and tPA knockout (tPA(-/-)) mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by an injection of 1Ã—10(6) BMSC (n=18) or phosphate-buffered saline (n=18) into the tail vein 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were performed at 3, 7, and 14 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effects of BMSC on functional recovery depended on presence or absence of tPA, even after adjusting for imbalanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMSC significantly improve functional recovery in WT mice compared to WT controls but show no beneficial effect in the tPA(-/-) mice compared to tPA(-/-) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Axonal density and synaptophysin-positive areas along the ischemic boundary zone of the cortex and striatum in WT mice are significantly higher than in the tPA(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMSC treatment significantly increases tPA protein level and activity only in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that endogenous tPA promotes BMSC-induced neurite outgrowth and may contribute to functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
