<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was strongly expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of the other 3 subtypes of FGFRs (FGFR-2, -3, and -4) were not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After temporal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, expression of FGFR-1 mRNA in cerebral cortical neurons markedly increased in association with the progressive neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; this increase was evident for at least 5 days after the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the neuroprotective activity of basic FGF reported so far, the present results suggest that FGFR-1 induction may subserve to self-protect neurons in the ischemic penumbral field of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
