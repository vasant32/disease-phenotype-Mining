<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used a recently introduced cerebral blood flow tracer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">technetium-99</z:chebi>-DL-hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi>, to map regional cerebral blood flow simultaneously with measurements of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> technique) using autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique was used to compare the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the more complex events that occur after induction of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> (SDH) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies with this SDH model have shown that an infarction is induced in the cortex under the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both models, the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone was associated with a reduction in both flow and metabolism to less than 15% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both models, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core was surrounded by a band of tissue in which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism increases by 60 to 70% and blood flow is reduced by the same amount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global blood flow after the SDH was reduced by 14%, but remained unchanged after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, a massive increase in metabolism (up to 157%) after SDH was accompanied by a paradoxical decrease in blood flow (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy between blood flow and metabolism indicates loss of flow-metabolism coupling and provides a mechanism for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> recruitment and delayed hippocampal damage after SDH </plain></SENT>
