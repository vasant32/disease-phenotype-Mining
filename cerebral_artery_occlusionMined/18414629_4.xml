<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The "developmental origins of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e>" hypothesis was originally derived from evidence linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, it has been expanded to include developmental exposures to environmental contaminants as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this study was to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to poly-chlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs) alters <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We exposed rats to the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (A1254) at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg/day in the maternal diet throughout gestation and lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced at 6-8 weeks of age via middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured in the cerebral cortex and striatum at 22 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCB congeners were quantified in brain tissue by gas chromatography with microelectron capture detection, and cortical and striatal expression of Bcl2 and Cyp2C11 were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Developmental exposure to A1254 significantly decreased striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in females and males at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predominantly ortho-substituted PCB congeners were detected above background levels in brains of adult females and males exposed to A1254 at 1 but not 0.1 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effects of developmental A1254 exposure on Bcl2 and Cyp2C11 expression did not correlate with effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data provide proof of principle that developmental exposures to environmental contaminants influence the response of the adult brain to ischemic injury and thus represent potentially important determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
