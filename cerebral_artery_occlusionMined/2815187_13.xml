<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue uptake of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine was used to indicate regional cerebral blood flow, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and variables were measured 2.5 or 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was found between tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration and the reciprocal of regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration was observed in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> production rate was estimated by plotting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration against the reciprocal of regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> concentration, on the other hand, was constant in ischemic and normally perfused regions, except in the center of the ischemic region 2.5 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, where a significant decrease was observed </plain></SENT>
