<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, whereas the function of NCX3 under physiological conditions has been determined, its role under <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess NCX3 role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we exposed ncx3-/- mice to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, to evaluate the effect of ncx3 ablation on neuronal survival, organotypic hippocampal cultures and primary cortical neurons from ncx3-/- mice were subjected to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) plus reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that ncx3 gene suppression leads to a worsening of brain damage after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to a massive neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the hippocampal fields of organotypic cultures as well as in cortical neurons from ncx3-/- mice exposed to OGD plus reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in ncx3-/- cortical neurons exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, NCX currents, recorded in the reverse mode of operation, were significantly lower than those detected in ncx3+/+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these results, NCX3 protein emerges as a new molecular target that may have a potential therapeutic value in modulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
