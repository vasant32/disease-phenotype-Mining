<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on gait function in adult rats with distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we assessed the longitudinal changes in gait using an automated computer-assisted gait analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four days after MCAO, intensity, maximal area of contact, and paw angle were significantly decreased in the affected forepaw whereas the double support time using ipsilateral paws increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative print positions between the fore and hindpaws and limb coupling were also altered, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affected sensorimotor status and reduced limb coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for paw angle, these impairments persisted for at least 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unlike human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, stride length and stance were not affected in rats with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Environmental enrichment for 4 weeks improved paw contact area and relative print position of the affected limb and reduced double support time in ischemic rats compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that gait analysis provides great insight into various aspects of motor function changes in ischemic quadrupeds, and that environmental enrichment is beneficial in reducing a variety of poststroke gait impairments possibly through enhanced structural plasticity mechanisms within injured cortical neuronal networks underlying locomotor function </plain></SENT>
