<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous human studies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-fluoromisonidazole and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO PET) have shown high tracer retention indicative of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, which had normalized at repeat scan &gt;48 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the only validation study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO, using ex vivo autoradiography in thread middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) rats, there was unexpected high uptake as late as 22 h after reperfusion, raising questions about the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO as a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report a pilot study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO PET in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous hypertensive rats were subjected to distal clip MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-hour dynamic PET was performed in 7 rats: 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, 1 with permanent MCAo (two sessions: 30 mins and 48 h after clip), and 3 with temporary MCAo (45 mins, n=1; 120 mins, n=2; scanning started 30 mins after clip removal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated by perfusion-fixation for standard histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late tracer retention was assessed by both compartmental modelling and simple side-to-side ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the initial PET session of the permanent MCAo rat, striking trapping of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO was observed in the affected cortex, which had normalized 48 h later; histopathology revealed pannecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no demonstrable tracer retention in either temporary MCAo models, and histopathology showed ischemic changes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results document elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO uptake in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> area only in the early phase of MCAo, but not after early reperfusion nor when tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> has developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support the validity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FMISO as a marker of viable hypoxic tissue/penumbra after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
