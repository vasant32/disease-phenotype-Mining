<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion, perfusion, T2, T1, angiographic, dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography were acquired longitudinally at multiple time points up to 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats subjected to 30-, 60-, and 90-minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spatiotemporal dynamics of postischemic HP was analyzed and compared with T1, T2 and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No early HP within 3 hours after recanalization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late (12 hours) HP was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals of the 30-minute MCAO group (N=20), half of the animals in the 60-minute MCAO group (N=8), and absent in the 90-minute MCAO group (N=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI and magnetic resonance angiography corroborated HP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion preceded T2 increase in some animals, but HP and T2 changes temporally coincided in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2 peaked first at 24 hours whereas HP peaked at 48 hours after occlusion, and HP resolved by day 7 in most animals at which point the arteries became tortuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pixel-by-pixel tracking analysis showed that tissue did not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (migrated from core or mismatch at 30 minutes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 48 hours) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow (CBF), whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue (migrated from core or mismatch at 30 minutes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 48 hours) showed exaggerated CBF, indicating that HP was associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
