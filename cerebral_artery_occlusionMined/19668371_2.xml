<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that there are correlations between the alteration of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and studied at 3 and 48 h of reperfusion, which are crucial times of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporal and spatial analyses of the evolution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> alteration in cortical and subcortical regions were conducted along with the correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found significant increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and reduction in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values between 3 and 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> tissue signature models: high K(i) and low <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, high K(i) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> K(i) and low <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that regions with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> alone are not likely to develop low <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> by 48 h and may undergo recovery </plain></SENT>
