<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> causes brain injury with activation of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that can contribute to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) reduces injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using IL-4 knockout (KO) adult male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-4 KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neuroscore and spontaneous activity for behavioral outcome, and immunostaining and stereological counting for cellular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infarction volume at 24 hours was significantly larger in IL-4 KO mice, neurological score was significantly worse, and spontaneous activity was reduced compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased macrophage/microglial infiltration, increased numbers of myeloperoxidase-positive cells, and increased Th1/Th2 ratio were observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core in IL-4 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced astrocyte activation was observed in the cortical penumbra in IL-4 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recombinant IL-4 administered intracerebroventricularly before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved neurological score, reduced macrophages/microglia, and lowered the Th1/Th2 ratio in IL-4 KO mice, but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of IL-4 signaling in KO mice was associated with worse outcome, and this was reversed by giving exogenous IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Worsened outcome was associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the core, which was reversed in IL-4 KO but not significantly changed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice by exogenous IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with IL-4 signaling leading to reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the core and a possible beneficial role for activated astrocytes in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
