<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore wished to compare the effects of GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405, EGIS-8332 and EGIS-10608, non-competitive AMPA receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> with homophthalazine chemical structures, in standard animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models with effects in a neurodegenerative model--excitoxicity in newborn mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGIS 10608 was a very powerful receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of white matter damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GYKI 52466 did not antagonize cortical and white matter damage induced by ibotenic acid </plain></SENT>
