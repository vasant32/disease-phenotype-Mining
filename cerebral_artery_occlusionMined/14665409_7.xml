<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=24) was induced by a 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using a novel intraluminal hollow filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to reperfusion, 12 of the ischemic rats received 6 ml isotonic saline at 37 degrees C infused into the ischemic area through the filament </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant overexpression (9-26 fold) of the genes encoding TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and ICAM-1 in ischemic rats was found during early reperfusion without flushing at 6 and 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase was significantly reduced at both 6 and 12 h post-reperfusion as a result of saline flushing </plain></SENT>
