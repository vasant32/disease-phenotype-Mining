<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The products resulting from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism of the both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways possess strong physiological activities, such as vasoconstriction and the enhancement of vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that these metabolites are involved in cerebral circulatory disturbance and the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is reported that intracerebral injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi>, C4, and E4 increased blood-brain barrier permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> may induce vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined role of the products resulting from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> of the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways on the formation of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the occlusion of right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (4mg/kg), was given intravenously 30 minutes before the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, azerastine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (8mg/kg), which has an inhibitory effect on the production and release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> from human neutrophil as well as an antagonistic action on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> and another inhibitory effect on the production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, was given intravenously 5 minutes prior to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (TxB2), 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> (6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>) measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percent water content of a cerebral hemisphere was determined by the wet-dry weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the occluded hemisphere, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>, TxB2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> significantly increased at 2, 6, 12 hours respectively, following the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion as compared to the control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
