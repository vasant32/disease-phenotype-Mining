<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> results in neuronal changes in remote areas that have fiber connections with the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that a high-signal-intensity lesion was observed in the substantia nigra after striatal infarction on T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in both clinical and experimental cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the origin of these changes in signal intensity remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the nigral changes by examining the correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and the tissue structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four days after the occlusion, when T2-weighted images revealed the presence of an area of high signal intensity in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using a 4.7-T superconductive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit, and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were calculated and imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examination by both light and electron microscopy was performed on day 4 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted images showed an area of high signal intensity in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map revealed uniform reduction of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Swelling of astrocytic end-feet was observed, especially in the pars reticulata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> changes in the ipsilateral substantia nigra after striatal injury consist mainly of swelling in the astrocytic end-feet </plain></SENT>
