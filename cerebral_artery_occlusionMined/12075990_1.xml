<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present experiment was to produce kidney cell lines that secrete GDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding two truncated N-terminal fragments of SV40 large T antigen, T155g and T155c, which does not code for small t antigen, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T155g was transduced into E17 cultured fetal Sprague-Dawley rat kidney cortex cells using a plasmid vector, and T155c was transduced with a plasmid and a retroviral vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen clones were isolated from cultures transfected with the T155g-expressing plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cell lines were obtained with T155c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four clones produced GDNF at physiological concentrations ranging from 55 to 93 pg/ml of medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These four clones were transplanted into the ischemic core or penumbra of rats that had undergone middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the four clones reduced the volume of infarction and the behavioral abnormalities normally resulting from MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blocking experiments with antibodies to GDNF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) suggested that these growth factors contributed only minimally to the reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and behavioral abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cell lines may be useful for intracerebral transplantation in animal models of brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
