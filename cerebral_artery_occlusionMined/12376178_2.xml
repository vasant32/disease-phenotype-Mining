<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats, a 2-min tibial nerve stimulation induced static contraction of the triceps surae, evoked pressor responses, increased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in both the RVLM and CVLM, decreased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in the CVLM, and increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in the RVLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rats with a temporary 90-min left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24 h reperfusion, pressor responses during muscle contractions were attenuated, as were <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> within the left RVLM and left CVLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> within the right RVLM and right CVLM were unaltered and similar to those in sham rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> increases during muscle contractions were enhanced in the left RVLM and CVLM but changes within the right CVLM and RVLM were similar to those in sham rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, opposite changes in ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> release within the RVLM and CVLM were observed following a 90-min right-sided MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, cardiovascular responses during muscle contraction were depressed following such an ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that transient ischemic brain injury attenuates cardiovascular responses to static exercise via modulating neurotransmission within the ventrolateral medulla </plain></SENT>
