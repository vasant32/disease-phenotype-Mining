<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and its receptor Tie2 mediate vascular integrity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> as does VEGF and its receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether MSC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases Ang1/Tie2 expression, and whether Ang1/Tie2 with VEGF/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (Flk1), in combination, induced by MSCs enhances <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow stromal cell treatment significantly decreased blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage and increased Ang1, Tie2, and occludin (a tight junction protein) expression in the ischemic border compared with MCAo control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further test the mechanisms of MSC-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular stabilization, cocultures of MSCs with mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) or astrocytes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supernatant derived from MSCs cocultured with MBECs significantly increased MBEC expression of Ang1/Tie2 and Flk1 compared with MBEC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marrow stromal cells cocultured with astrocytes also significantly increased astrocyte VEGF and Ang1/Tie2 expression compared with astrocyte culture alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media from MSCs alone, and media from cocultures of MSCs with astrocytes or MBECs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly increased capillary tube-like formation of MBEC compared with control Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Flk1 and/or Ang1 significantly decreased MSC-induced MBEC tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Tie2 expression in MBECs significantly inhibited MSC-induced tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate MSC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular stabilization, which is at least partially mediated by VEGF/Flk1 and Ang1/Tie2 </plain></SENT>
