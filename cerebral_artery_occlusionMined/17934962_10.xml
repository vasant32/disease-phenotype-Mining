<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) opening during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reperfusion permits the passage of smaller macromolecules but not larger ones and that this molecular size restriction disappears over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following 3 hours (h) of unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and either 3 or 21 h of reperfusion, Wistar rats (n = 42) were injected with Evans blue (EB, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> that binds instantly to plasma albumin yielding EB-tagged albumin, EB-Alb) and with one of three fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> ranging in size from 77- to 2000-kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During occlusion and reperfusion, ischemic status of the affected tissue was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood-to-brain transfer of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> relative to that of EB-Alb was examined by fluorescence microscopy within three regions with ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase in EB-Alb leakage from 3 to 21 h of reperfusion was significant (from 40-60% to 80-90% of fields examined; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-leakage of the largest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> used 2000-kDa, with EB-Alb was observed in only 40% of the fields at 3+3 h, but nearly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> at 3 + 21 h (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal distribution of the tracers differed among the fields and included considerable cellular uptake of EB-Alb and some of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supporting the hypothesis, opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was insufficient to allow passage of the largest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> at 3 + 3 h in about 40% of the microvascular networks viewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of total leaky microvascular beds increased by nearly 50% between 3 + 3 h and 3 + 21 h </plain></SENT>
