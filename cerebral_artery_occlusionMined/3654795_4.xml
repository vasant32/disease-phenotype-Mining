<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-NMR spectra were serially obtained during 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and a subsequent 4-h recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate (PCr) to inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) (PCr/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) showed a precipitous decrease in parallel with changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as during recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, as determined by EEG criteria, exhibited a much smaller decrease in PCr/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, there was a splitting and significant shift of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> peak immediately after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the shifted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> peak rapidly increased and remained elevated throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> also increased, but not as markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular pH determination by chemical shift of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> peak revealed a decrease from 7.1 to 6.2-6.3 during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the subsequent recovery period in the animals with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, whereas the pH in the animals with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> did not show a significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A gradual decrease in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) to 57-79% of the control was exhibited in severely stroked animals during both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the recovery period, whereas there was no change in ATP in the mild stroked animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the dynamic process of pathophysiological changes in an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model in the cat leads to significant differences in cerebral metabolism between animals with mild and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
