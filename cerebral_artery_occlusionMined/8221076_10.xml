<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is a major risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autonomic responses to MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were therefore investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), renal sympathetic nerve discharge (SND), plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and ECG were measured in 16 SHR and 16 WKY male <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, which were subjected to either MCAO or sham MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size did not differ between SHR and WKY rats, as shown by tetrazolium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial AP was significantly higher in SHR (96 +/- 4 mmHg) than in WKY (70 +/- 1 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in initial HR or plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels were observed between SHR and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 6 hours after MCAO, AP, SND and plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> in SHR decreased significantly, while HR showed a significant increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SND and plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> in the WKY showed increases that did not reach significant levels following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The QT interval of the ECG was significantly prolonged in the WKY MCAO rats, which also had a higher frequency of cardiac myocytolysis than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike the increases in autonomic variables following MCAO in Wistar rats, SHR exhibit significant decreases in SND and AP, while WKY show slight, but non-significant increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences in the autonomic reaction to MCAO may reflect genetic differences in the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
