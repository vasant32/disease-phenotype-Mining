<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surviving treated animals promptly recovered consciousness, locomotion, and feeding behavior despite persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, while control animals ran an indolent course, with slow recovery of poor quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral lesions</z:e> in treated animals were confined to the deep hemispheric structures, while control specimens showed larger deep lesions confluent with extensive areas of cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are less dramatic than those reported by others, but the protective effect observed in fields of collateral circulation deserves further exploration as an adjunct to medical and surgical management </plain></SENT>
