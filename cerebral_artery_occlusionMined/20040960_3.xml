<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were fed with the aqueous extract of Embelia ribes (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 30 days of feeding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals were anaesthetized with chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was occluded with a 4-0 suture for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suture was removed after 2 h, to allow reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were used for grip strength measurement, biochemical estimation in serum and brain tissue (hippocampus and frontal cortex) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ischemic group, a significant (P &lt; 0.01) alteration in the markers of oxidative damage (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS); reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR); and, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST)) was observed in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, as compared to sham operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that the animals treated with the aqueous extract of Embelia ribes had a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in the poststroke grip strength activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, supplementation with aqueous extract of Embelia ribes reversed the levels/activities of the above mentioned biochemical parameters significantly (P&lt; 0.01) and also resulted in decreased cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, as compared to the ischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study, for the first time, provide clear evidence that aqueous extract of Embelia ribes pretreatment ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury and enhances the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense against middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats; it exhibits neuroprotective property </plain></SENT>
