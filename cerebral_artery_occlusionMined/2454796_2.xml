<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the changes in amplitude of the first short latency positive potential (2.3 +/- 0.3 msec, mean +/- S.D.) of the direct cortical response (DCR) elicited by surface electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in anaesthetised baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local cortical blood flow, measured by the hydrogen clearance method, was progressively reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and was related to the amplitude of this potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With flow levels greater than 25 ml/100 g/min the DCR was essentially unaffected, but it was lost with flows below 20 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a threshold relationship between the generation of the electrical activity evoked in the cortical elements and local cortical flow, similar to that previously demonstrated for cortical somatosensory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
