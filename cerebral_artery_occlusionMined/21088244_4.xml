<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: we have shown that anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy to neutralize the neurite growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A results in functional improvement and enhanced plasticity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether functional improvement and neuronal plasticity can be induced by this immunotherapy when administered to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-impaired rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: adult rats were trained to perform the skilled forelimb reaching test, followed by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to impair the preferred forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, animals showing a profound deficit were randomly distributed to 3 groups: no treatment, control antibody, or anti-Nogo-A antibody (11C7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were tested weekly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surgery and daily after antibody treatment until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> tracing was injected into the nonlesioned forelimb motor cortex at the end of behavioral testing to determine axonal plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats showed similar forelimb impairment before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy started to show improvement 3 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such improvement became significantly better than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-only control and control Ab-treated animals, and persisted to the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-labeled axonal fiber analysis also showed significant enhanced corticorubral axonal sprouting from the contralesional forelimb motor cortex to the deafferented red nucleus in the anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these results indicate that improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurological deficits and enhancement of neuronal plasticity can be induced in the adult rat with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy, and that this therapy may be used to restore function even when administered long after ischemic brain damage has occurred </plain></SENT>
