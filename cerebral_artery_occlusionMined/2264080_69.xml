<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We then processed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brains for histopathologic assessment of the volume of ischemic damage 4 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic damage was varied by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at a point either proximal (n = 4) or distal (n = 4) to the lenticulostriate vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion elevated the dialysate contents of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The largest increases occurred for the potentially neurotoxic amino acids <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (800-2,800% of basal efflux) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed smaller increases for the "metabolic" amino acids (280-580% of basal efflux) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distal occlusion did not affect amino acid efflux in the striatum, and release in the cortex was significantly lower than that following proximal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared release data with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> histopathologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion resulted in a large volume of ischemic damage in the cortex and striatum (25-48% of hemispheric volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A smaller volume of ischemic damage was noted following distal occlusion (0-21% of hemispheric volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The volume of ischemic damage and the amount of amino acid release were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
