<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Different grading systems of arterial recanalisation have never been compared in large series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and angiographic findings and outcome were analysed in 147 patients with M1 or M2 segment occlusion of the middle cerebral artery treated with IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations of the thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) grading system and the Mori grading system with clinical outcome were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median NIHSS score on admission was 15 and the mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to IAT was 242 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After three months the outcome was favourable (defined as modified Rankin scale score (mRS) &lt; or = 2) in 85 patients (58%) and poor (mRS 3 to 5) in 44 (30%); 18 patients (12%) were dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalisation was categorised as TIMI grade 0 in 17 patients (12%), TIMI 1 in 16 (11%), TIMI 2 in 83 (56%), and TIMI 3 in 31(21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (12%) showed Mori grade 0 reperfusion, 16 (11%) Mori 1, 37 (25%) Mori 2, 46 (31%) Mori 3, and 31 (21%) Mori 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both TIMI and Mori grading systems, reopening the artery was an independent predictor of a favourable clinical outcome (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When recanalisation was partial, outcome was better in patients with reperfusion &gt;50% (Mori 3) than in those with reperfusion &lt;50% (Mori 2) (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both TIMI and Mori grading systems are useful for predicting outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When recanalisation is partial the Mori classification is more refined in giving prognostic information </plain></SENT>
