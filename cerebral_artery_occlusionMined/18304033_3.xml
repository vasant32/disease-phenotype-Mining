<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the angiography and clinical data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion patients who underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis from 1994 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment angiographic findings at the occlusive lesions were classified as either blurred or sharp, depending on whether the proximal portion of the occlusive lesions had poorly or well demarcated margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using uni- or multivariate analysis, recanalization was correlated with our angiographic classification or other clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis during the 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of the angiograms could be classified into one of the two categories: Blurred-type in 20 patients and Sharp-type in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed a significant association of the classification with recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(Recanalization rate: 95% in Blurred-type and 38% in Sharp-type, P &lt; .0001) Logistic regression analysis showed that the association was independent from other factors (P= .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, our classification may indicate the difficulty of the recanalization procedure, and may assist in patient triage for different intra-arterial treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
