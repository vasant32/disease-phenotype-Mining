<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three investigators with different degrees of experience: A, well skilled; B, 2 years of experience; C, a novice with 6 months of experience, each subjected 10 Sprague-Dawley rats to permanent MCAO using low-viscosity <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated sutures with a mean diameter 0.468+/-0.013 mm (mean+/-S.D.) at the tip and 0.361+/-0.013 mm in the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size 24 h after MCAO was similar among the three investigators: A, 204.7+/-33.2 mm3; B, 212.6+/-42.8, and C, 195.9+/-44.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation was 16.2% to 22.7%, and 19.4% for the three investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated sutures (Koizumi's method) provides good reproducibility and reliability, among investigators of varying experience </plain></SENT>
