<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion times ranged from 8 to 19 minutes under moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> at 28.8 degrees to 30.3 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEPs were preserved for variable times during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, ranging from no increase in latency after 13 minutes of occlusion to severe deterioration after 6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In no case was <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion maintained for longer than 3 minutes in the presence of a severely disturbed SEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery of the SEP to its preoperative relationship with that of the nonoperated hemisphere was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases before the end of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were awake after rewarming at the end of operation without any neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monitoring the SEP pertaining to the territory of a cerebral artery during its temporary occlusion can help avoid ischemic damage and will allow the surgeon to take advantage of the several benefits of this technique in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
