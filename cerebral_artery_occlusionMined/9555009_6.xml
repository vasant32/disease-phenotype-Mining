<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DWI, T2I and PWI were performed before, during, and after induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from 1 h to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values in the ischemic region significantly declined from the preischemic ADCw values (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The post ischemic increase in T2 of the control group was significantly higher at 48 h than in the anti-ICAM-1 treated group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The temporal profiles of MRI cluster analysis, which combines ADCw and T2 maps into a single image, was significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the neuroprotective effect of anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment is reflected in reductions of T2 and lesion growth during reperfusion and may not be associated with increased cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
