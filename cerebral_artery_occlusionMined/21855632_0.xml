<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of pathological damage in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to evaluate the therapeutic neuroprotective effect of ginkgolide B in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TTC stain, brain water content and Evans-Blue extravasation were used to quantify brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that basal ganglia undergo progressive pathological damage earlier following MCAO, and injury was stable and irreversible after 5 h following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
