<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that tissue damage and functional outcome after experimental or clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are shaped by biologic sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the novel hypothesis that ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from neuronally derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) or poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase (PARP-1) activation is sexually dimorphic and that interruption of these molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways benefits only the male brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) knockout (nNOS-/-) mice exhibited exacerbated histological injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) females, unlike the protection observed in male nNOS-/- littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, treatment with the nNOS inhibitor (7-nitroindozole, 25 mg/kg) increased infarction in female C57Bl6 WT mice, but protected male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for this sexually specific response is not mediated through changes in protein expression of endothelial NOS or inducible NOS, or differences in intraischemic cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike male PARP-1 knockouts (PARP1-/-), female PARP1-/- littermates sustained grossly increased ischemic damage relative to sex-matched WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PJ-34, 10 mg/kg) resulted in identical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of PARP-1 resulted in reversal of the neuroprotective activity by the female sex steroid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the previously described cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways involving NO and PARP ischemic neurotoxicity may be operant solely in male brain and that the integrity of nNO/PARP-1 signaling is paradoxically protective in the female </plain></SENT>
