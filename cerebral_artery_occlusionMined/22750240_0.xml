<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported on the efficacy of an NK1 tachykinin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in improving outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including reduced blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and improved functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinically approved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has been associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, if given at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, adjunctive therapies have been investigated to reduce the adverse effects of tPA and improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of a combination of an NK1 tachykinin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with tPA, on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and functional outcome following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats using a reversible thread model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> where occlusion was maintained for 2h, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals received either 25mg/kg of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-l-tryptophan or 1mg/kg of tPA, either alone or in combination, or equal volume saline vehicle, intravenously at the time of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed by the rotarod, bilateral asymmetry test, modified neuroscore and open field tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was assessed by Evans Blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy of an NK1 tachykinin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with tPA significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, functional deficits and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, combined tPA-NK1 tachykinin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> treatment may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of reperfusion injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
