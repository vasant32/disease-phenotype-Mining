<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The therapeutic potential of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) has been demonstrated in different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is well established that BMSCs selectively migrate to the site of brain injury, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study addresses the hypothesis that selectins mediate the recruitment of BMSCs into the postischemic cerebral microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell recruitment was monitored using either fluorescent- or radiolabeled BMSCs detected by intravital microscopy or tissue radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with either a blocking antibody against P- or E-selectin or with the nonselective selectin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, fucoidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of CD44 in cell recruitment was evaluated using BMSCs from CD44 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion was associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of BMSCs in cerebral venules compared with sham mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoneutralization of either E- or P-selectin blocked the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion-induced recruitment of adherent BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An attenuated recruitment response in the postischemic hemisphere was also noted after fucoidin treatment or administration of CD44-deficient BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral vascular endothelium assume a proadhesive phenotype after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> that favors the recruitment of BMSCs, which use both P- and E-selectin to home into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD44 may serve as the critical ligand for selectin-mediated BMSC recruitment </plain></SENT>
