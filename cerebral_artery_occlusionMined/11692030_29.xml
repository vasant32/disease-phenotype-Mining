<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proven behavioral assessment strategies for testing potential therapeutic agents in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies include tasks that demand higher levels of sensorimotor and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because behavioral outcome and rate of recovery vary among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models, there is a need to characterize and compare performance on specific tasks across models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To this end, sensorimotor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were assessed during a 5-week period after either permanent proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) or permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with a 90-minute occlusion of both common carotid arteries (dMCAO/tCCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EBST, hindlimb and forelimb placing, and cylinder tests were given at regular intervals postinjury to assess sensorimotor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed with a multitrial water navigation task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: pMCAO, which caused both striatal and cortical damage, produced persistent sensorimotor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Limb placing responses and postural reflexes were impaired throughout the month of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A persistent bias for using the ipsilateral forelimb for wall movements in the cylinder test was observed as well as a bias for landing on the opposite forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pMCAO rats were also impaired in the water navigation task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>dMCAO/tCCAO, which caused only cortical damage, produced similar sensorimotor deficits, but these were greatly diminished by 2 weeks after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No impairment was found for water tank navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Correlations between forelimb placing (both models), water navigation performance (pMCAO model), and sensorimotor asymmetry (dMCAOtCCAO model) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the range of functions affected and stability of observed deficits, the pMCAO model appears to be preferable to the dMCAO/tCCAO model for use in assessing therapeutic agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
