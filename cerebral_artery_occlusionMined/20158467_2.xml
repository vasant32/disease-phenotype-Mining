<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore the purpose of this study investigated the relationship between neural progenitors and reactive astrocytes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was induced by occlusion of a right cerebral artery in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fate of progenitor cells and the surrounding cells was investigated by immunochemical staining for nestin, vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells at several locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vimentin and nestin positive cells were observed in the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ), striatum, and cortex at 3 and 7 days after MCAO, but those cells were not found at 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reactive astrocyte positive cells increased following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These reactive astrocytes induced astrocytes differentiation of progenitor cells and formed dense astroglioses surrounding the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactive astrocytes are thought to protect the penumbra during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We examined which brain cell expressed nestin and GFAP in the ipsilateral co-expression at 7 days after MCAO, especially at the core of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that robust reactive astrocytes after MCAO were possibly differentiation from the induced nestin-positive cells after early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
