<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether EGb 761 regulates the expression of PEA-15 and two phosphorylated forms of PEA-15 (Ser 104 and Ser 116) in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior to MCAO and cerebral cortices were collected 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reduction in expression of PEA-15 and its phosphorylated forms induced by MCAO injury was detected using a proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 pretreatment prevented the ischemic injury-induced decrease in PEA-15 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that EGb 761 attenuates the injury-induced reduction in PEA-15, phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104), phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of PEA-15 influences its anti-apoptotic function; a decrease in PEA-15 phosphorylation induces apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of PEA-15 phosphorylation by EGb 761 pretreatment during cerebral ischemic injury indicates that EGb 761 is a neuroprotective against cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
