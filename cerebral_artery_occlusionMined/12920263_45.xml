<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 has substantial protective effects when administered immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the efficacy of this drug when administered 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a more clinically relevant time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Before surgery, marmosets were trained and tested on a number of neurological tests, which assessed general neurological function, motor ability, and spatial awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), marmosets received a bolus of saline (n=13) or NXY-059 (n=13), and osmotic minipumps were implanted, providing 48-hour saline or drug (85 micromol/kg per hour) infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were retested 3 and 10 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was evaluated with histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The unbound plasma NXY-059 concentration was 200+/-9 micromol/L after 24-hour infusion, a concentration well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment ameliorated the long-term motor impairment produced by pMCAO; the marmosets were better at using their contralesional, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-affected arm than controls at both 3 and 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saline-treated animals had a debilitating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> at 3 weeks with residual signs evident at 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 treatment substantially attenuated neglect at 3 weeks, with no deficit being seen at 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 reduced the overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 28% (saline, 324+/-46 mm3; NXY-059, 234+/-30 mm3) with protection to the cortex, white matter, and subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is an effective neuroprotective agent when administered 4 hours after pMCAO in a primate species, attenuating both motor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The compound also substantially lessened the volume of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
