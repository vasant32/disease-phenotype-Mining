<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> the neuroprotective effects of increasing the blood oxygen transport capacity by applying a semifluorinated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="18310">alkane</z:chebi> (SFA)-containing emulsion together with normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spread of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was studied using pimonidazole given prior to filament-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO, 2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of intravenous injection of saline or the SFA-containing emulsion (0.5 or 1.0 ml/100g body weight; [SFA(0.5) or SFA(1.0)]) either upon establishing MCAO (early treatment) or after filament removal (delayed treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After injection NBO was administered for 8 h (early treatment) or 6 h (delayed treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated 8 or 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In serial brain sections tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and irreversible cell damage were quantitatively determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-related gene expression (VEGF, flt-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early treatment significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced the volumes of tissue damage (8 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 57±34 mm³; controls, 217±70 mm³; 24 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 189±82 mm³; controls, 317±60 mm³) and of P-Add immunoreactivity (8 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 261±37 mm³; controls, 339±26 mm³; 24h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 274±47 mm³; controls, 364±46 mm³) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment was comparably successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The volume of the hypoxic penumbra was not decreased by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, VEGF and flt-1 mRNA levels did not differ between the experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that increasing the blood oxygen transport capacity in the plasma compartment provides a neuroprotective effect by alleviating the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> to a level sufficient to prevent cells from transition into irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
