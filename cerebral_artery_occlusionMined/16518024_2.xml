<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study applied microarray technique to investigate the molecular basis through which enriched environment might improve spatial learning in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MCAO rats were housed in enriched environment or in standard single cages, and sham-operated rats were housed in standard single cages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial learning was assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> on postoperative days 22 to 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the ipsilateral hippocampus was extracted for microarray analysis after the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Water-maze performance on postoperative days 22 to 24 showed that rats subjected to transient MCAO were impaired in the hippocampus-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enriched environment housing reversed the spatial learning impairment on postoperative day 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression in the hippocampus was not affected by MCAO or following enriched environment housing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Spatial learning impairment following transient MCAO in rats and cognitive improvement following housing in enriched environment is not related to % related to extrahippocampal brain regions rather than altered hippocampal gene expression </plain></SENT>
