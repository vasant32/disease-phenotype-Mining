<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Etk/Bmx (epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase, also known as BMX), a member of the Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>) family of protein-tyrosine kinases, is an important regulator of signal transduction for the activation of cell growth, differentiation, and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that activation of Etk leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-468 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the role of Etk in neuronal injury induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we found that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Etk and its downstream signaling molecule Stat1 in primary cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting Etk activity by LFM-A13 or knocking down Etk expression by a specific shRNA increased the survival of primary cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, at 1 day after a 60-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in adult rats, both phosphorylated Etk and Stat1 were coexpressed with apoptotic markers in neurons in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with LFM-A13 or an adenoviral vector encoding the kinase deletion mutant Etkk attenuated caspase-3 activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together, our data suggest that Etk is activated after neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suppressing Etk activity protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
