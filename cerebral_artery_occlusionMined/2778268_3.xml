<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurons in the insular cortex have recently been shown to innervate medullary autonomic nuclei such as the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the effect of lesioning the insular cortex on baroreceptor-heart rate reflex in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did this by occluding the stem of the left proximal middle cerebral artery which causes a lesion of the insular and adjacent lateral frontoparietal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine and 10 days after lesioning or sham operation, reflex heart rate responses were recorded following i.v. doses of the pressor agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> and the depressor agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baroreceptor reflex parameters were determined by computerized sigmoidal curve-fitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall contribution of the sympathetic and the cardiac vagus were assessed by using peripherally acting muscarinic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesioned rats were compared to sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesioning the insular cortex did not affect mean blood pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the lesion selectively enhanced reflex vagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> that occurred when mean blood pressure was artificially elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A greater vagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> with no change in the upper plateau indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was acting entirely on the baroreflex-dependent vagal cardiac motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on the sympathetic heart rate range but the normalized gain of the sympathetic component was increased in those lesioned rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the unilateral cortical lesion chronically affected the baroreceptor control of heart rate through mechanisms differentially affecting the vagus and the cardiac sympathetic nerves </plain></SENT>
