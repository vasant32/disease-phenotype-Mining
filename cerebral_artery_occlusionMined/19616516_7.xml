<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, six aquaporins (AQPs) have been found in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas studies have been focused on AQP1, -4 and -9, little is known about the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify roles of AQP3, -5 and -8 in water movement, we examined the expression patterns of AQP3, -5 and -8 in ischemic brains from the rats with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the expression of AQP4 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which was used as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of AQP4 increased continuously until 24 h after pMCAO in both the ischemic core and the border region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased expression was correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, whereas the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8 continued to increase until 24 h after pMCAO in the border region but decreased 6 h after pMCAO in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found AQPs were colocalized with GFAP-positive astrocytes and/or NeuN-positive neurons in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first study describing the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8 in rat brains subjected to pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that dynamic changes of AQP3, -4, -5 and -8 expression could contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Besides, AQP3, -5 and -8 may be involved in the neuronal swelling </plain></SENT>
