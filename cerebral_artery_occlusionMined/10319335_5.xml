<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the role of P-selectin may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, a possible protective effect on ischemic brain injury by blocking P-selectin has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effects of a novel anti-P-selectin antibody on ischemic brain injury after 24 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO by an insertion of a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber cylinder for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-rat P-selectin monoclonal antibody, ARP 2-4, was injected intravenously at a dose of 1 mg kg-1 at 5 min before the induction of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control animals received the same volume of vehicle solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured immediately after and at 8 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At decapitation of rats at 24 h of permanent MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was compared between the antibody and vehicle treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunohistochemistry for <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> and HSP72, and histochemistry for TUNEL were also, compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with ARP 2-4 improved rCBF at 8 h of MCAO (55.4% +/- 11.7% of control, n = 5) as compared to vehicle group (24.2% +/- 11.8%, n = 5, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> was not normally detected by monoclonal antibodies for CD11a and CD18, it became remarkably evident at 1 day of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although HSP72 and TUNEL were not also detected in sham control brains, they were induced in neurons of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area at 1 day of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ARP 2-4 significantly reduced the numbers of leukocyte and neurons with positive HSP72 and TUNEL stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that an administration of a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin improved rCBF, and attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size that was associated with reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with the antibody reduced both HSP72 and TUNEL stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an important role of P-selectin in ischemic brain damage, and a future therapeutic potential to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
