<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After each ischemic episode, a 10-min recirculation period was allowed, following which the brain was fixed and processed for electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The earliest alterations, detected in the cerebral cortex after 15 min, increased in severity with longer ischemic episodes and were distributed multifocally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was: (a) marked neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrical swelling and progressive condensation of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm; (b) cytoplasmic swelling of astrocytes with preservation of glial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> volume; (c) capillaries, oligodendrocytes, myelin sheaths and axis cylinders did not change significantly, even after the longest interval studied: 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This type of tissue reaction appears to be common for those forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, in which circulation is either sustained partially (via collateral arteries) or restored after a period of absolute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, as yet undefined permeability changes in cell membranes lead to pronounced volumetric alterations of cellular compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no softening is detectable by digital examination, we suggest that such a set of structural abnormalities constitutes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">encephalomalacia</z:e>, or the earliest stage of a lesion which is designated infarction, once it reaches irreversibility </plain></SENT>
