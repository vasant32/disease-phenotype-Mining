<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been shown to visualize <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions in the brain before changes are observable with conventional magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI changes are unclear and may include both reversible and irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions may be reversed with MK801 therapy postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12) were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and DWI scans were obtained beginning 60 min postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distinct regions of hyperintensity were observed in the basal ganglia and cortex, corresponding with the expected distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first scan, animals were treated with MK801 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline and subsequently scanned again 30 and 60 min after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the area of hyperintense lesions continued to increase, by 55% in the cortex and 57% in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MK801 therapy significantly (p &lt; 0.01) reduced the area of damage by the third DWI scan at 60 min posttreatment (-50% cortex, -22% basal ganglia, -41% total hemisphere) compared to pretreatment scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tetrazolium (TTC) stains at 24 h confirmed that MK801 significantly reduced the volumes of infarction (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that significant portions of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion on DWI are reversible with pharmacologic intervention </plain></SENT>
