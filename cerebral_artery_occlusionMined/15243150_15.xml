<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous fibrinolysis inhibitors play an essential role in the coagulation/fibrinolysis balance and may be involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine the predictive value of pretreatment levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors (PAI-1, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), TAFI, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>) on SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive tPA-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood samples were obtained just before tPA administration and fibrinolysis inhibitors were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained at 24 hours or when a neurological worsening occurred to rule out SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (40% women, age 75 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 17 (range, 7 to 22) and mean time to treatment was 160 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (7.9%) presented with a SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In analyses based on clinical and CT variables, no relation could be found with SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When laboratory data were analyzed, patients who experienced SICH showed lower baseline PAI-1 (21.7+/-3.5 ng/mL versus 31.8+/-12.1 ng/mL; P&lt;0.01) and higher TAFI (216.7+/-78.4% versus 162.1+/-54.2%; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) were not related to SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only factors associated with SICH were TAFI &gt;180% (OR, 12.9; CI, 1.41 to 118.8; P=0.02) and PAI-1 &lt;21.4 ng/mL (OR, 12.75; CI, 1.17 to 139.2; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combination of admission PAI-1 &lt;21.4 ng/mL and TAFI &gt;180% had a sensibility of 75% and a specificity of 97.6% (P&lt;0.01) predicting SICH, with a positive predictive value of 75% and negative predictive value of 97.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Baseline PAI-1 and TAFI levels predict SICH after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> tPA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the future, these biomarkers could be used to improve thrombolysis safety </plain></SENT>
