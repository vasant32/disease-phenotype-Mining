<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> as an endogenous substance possesses a number of cytoprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the study, we have evaluated the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and investigated whether <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> exerted neuroprotection through affecting calpain/calpastatin or caspase-3 actions during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, since calpain and caspase-3 play central roles in ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> was administrated intravenously 1 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose-responses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> to MCAo were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, the effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> on the activities of calpain, calpastatin and caspase-3, the levels of calpastatin, microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and alphaII-spectrin, and the apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in penumbra were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> reduced neurological deficits and decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 24 h after MCAo in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 50 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> significantly increased the calpastatin protein levels and activities, and markedly reduced the m-calpain and caspase-3 activities in penumbra 24 h after MCAo, however, it had no significant effect on mu-calpain activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> significantly increased the MAP-2 and alphaII-spectrin protein levels, and markedly reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced TUNEL staining positive score within penumbra 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the dose-dependent neuroprotection of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and suggest that one of protective mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be blocking the m-calpain and caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
