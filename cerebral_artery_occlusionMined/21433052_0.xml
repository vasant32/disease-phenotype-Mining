<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon reperfusion, nPt or vehicle was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 hr after the tMCAO, motor function, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, immunohistochemistry of neurovascular components (endothelial NAGO, tight junctional occludin, and basal laminal collagen IV), and zymography for MMP-9 activity were examined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle, treatment with nPts significantly improved the motor function and greatly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, especially in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that tMCAO resulted in a minimal decrease of NAGO and occludin but a great decrease of collagen IV and a remarkable increase of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nPts greatly reduced this decrease of collagen IV and activation of MMP-9 and, with large reductions of MMP-9 activation on zymography and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that treatment with nPts ameliorates the neurological scores with a large reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as the preservation of outer components of the neurovascular unit (collagen IV) and inactivation of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
