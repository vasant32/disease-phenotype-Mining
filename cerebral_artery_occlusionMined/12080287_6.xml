<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (VIP) belong to the same <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> family, and both neuropeptides have been shown to exert in vitro and in vivo neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the protective effects of PACAP and VIP in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect on the progression of the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Male rats were injected 450 pmol PACAP or VIP dissolved in physiological saline intracerebroventricularly, preceding the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals received vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by the intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 12 or 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and infarcted brain areas were determined by staining bran sections with triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the infarcted brain volume resulted to be 14.8% in the control group, 15.3% in the VIP-treated group and 5.8% in the PACAP-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the infarcted brain volumes were 21.5%, 20.7% and 14.3% in the control, VIP and PACAP-treated animals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results provide further evidence for the neuroprotective effects of PACAP38 as given in form of a preischemic bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It slows down the progression of the evolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and reduces the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, VIP, does not have neuroprotective effects under the same experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
