<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is mainly functionally affected and shows changes in nNOS and iNOS expression during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the aim to study possible relationships between these changes and the affection entity during the animal recovery, we investigated from 24 up to 144 h after reperfusion the expression and content of these two NOS isoforms in the neurons and microglia and the degree of microglia reactivity in the fronto-parietal cortices of rats undertaken to transient MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of motor-sensory performances and survival allowed dividing the animals into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, western blot and quantitative analysis demonstrated, both in the ischemic and contralateral cortex of the rats with longer survival, wellness and significantly increased number of the nNOS-IR neurons at 24 h and moderately activated microglia up to 144 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the rats not recovering, injured and significantly decreased nNOS-IR neurons, intensely activated microglia and appearance of iNOS-IR were seen at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, since the recovery occurs when nNOS-IR neurons are greatly increased, we presume nNOS protect the tissue likely controlling the passage from the state of reactive to that of activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the morphological signs of wellness and the two-fold increase in number of the nNOS-IR neurons appear to be characteristic of the "penumbra" area and could explain why this region is mainly functionally affected </plain></SENT>
