<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mice containing deletions in the genes encoding nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase have been useful to dissect the role of NO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that mice lacking expression of the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) develop larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because NO or a related product of NO synthase activity is important for relaxation of cerebral blood vessels, we examined for possible hemodynamic differences in the peri-ischemic zone of eNOS-deficient and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using functional CT scanning techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> SV129 mice (n = 10) and mice deficient in eNOS gene expression (n = 10) were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, functional CT scanning was performed with dynamic scanning protocols to measure the cerebral transit profiles of injected contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A temporal correlation mapping technique was used to analyze the pattern of hemodynamic perturbations based on alterations in the shape of the cerebral transit profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical thresholds defined the hemodynamic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemodynamic deficits were more severe in the mutant than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When expressed as a percentage of the total insult, core areas were significantly increased in mutant mice (39.8 +/- 3.7%) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp> (28.8 +/- 3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, areas of the hemodynamic penumbra were significantly smaller in mice deficient in eNOS activity (60.2 +/- 3.7%) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (71.2 +/- 3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the calculated relative perfusion index within the hemodynamic penumbra was significantly lower in the group with eNOS gene deletion (35.6 +/- 1.5% in mutants versus 43.0 +/- 2.4% in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that mice lacking eNOS expression show a greater degree of hemodynamic compromise after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and suggest that a product of eNOS activity (eg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NO) may protect brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, possibly by improving blood flow within the penumbral zone </plain></SENT>
