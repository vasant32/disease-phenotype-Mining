<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To test the hypotheses that (i) the regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of brain <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br)) provides a parameter for ischemic progression not available from apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) data, and (ii) [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) increases more in ischemic cortex than in the caudate putamen (CP) with its lesser collateral circulation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: (23)Na twisted projection MRI was performed at 3 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) was independently determined by flame photometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic core was localized by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, by microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry, and by changes in surface reflectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the ischemic core, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio relative to the contralateral tissue was homogeneous (0.63 +/- 0.07), whereas the rate of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) increase (slope) was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.005): 22 +/- 4%/h in the sites of maximum slope versus 14 +/- 1%/h elsewhere (here 100% is [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](br) in the contralateral brain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum slopes in the cortex were higher than in CP (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic regions, there was no slope/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> correlation between animals and within the same brain (P &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum slope was located at the periphery of ischemic core in 8/10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unlike <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, (23)Na MRI detected within-core ischemic lesion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
