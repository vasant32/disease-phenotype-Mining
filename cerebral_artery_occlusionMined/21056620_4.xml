<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that the number of newly generated neurons is increased in the young and adult rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) after transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether increase in neurogenesis in the adult DG induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is transient or sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here reported that from 2 weeks to 6 months after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), there were more doublecortin positive (DCX+) cells in the ipsilateral compared to the sham-control and contralateral DG of the adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the S-phase marker 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 2 days after MCAO to label newly generated cells, a large number of BrdU-labeled neuroblasts differentiated into mature granular neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These BrdU-labeled neurons survived for at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When BrdU was injected 6 weeks after injury, there were still more newly generated neuroblasts differentiated into mature neurons in the ipsilateral DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data indicate that transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> initiates a prolonged increase in neurogenesis and promotes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of the newly generated neurons in the adult DG </plain></SENT>
