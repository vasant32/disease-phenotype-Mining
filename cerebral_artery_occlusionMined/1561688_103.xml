<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The rat is now extensively used for studies on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and several novel pharmacological principles have been worked out in rat models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess how ischemic tissue can be salvaged by reperfusion in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> that gives infarction of both the caudoputamen and the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle cerebral artery of anesthetized rats was occluded for 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 180 minutes by an intraluminal filament, and recirculation was instituted for 7 days to allow assessment of the density and localization of ischemic brain damage using histopathologic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured in separate animals to verify that removal of the filament was followed by adequate recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following 15 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> seven of eight rats showed selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the caudoputamen, while the neocortex was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of occlusion, seven of eight animals had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> localized to the lateral caudoputamen, and four of eight had selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 60 minutes induced cortical infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size increased progressively with increasing occlusion time, up to 120-180 minutes, when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were as extensive as those observed following 24 hours of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a time window for salvage of penumbral tissues by reperfusion that is shorter than that suggested on the basis of previous data in other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results probably reflect a lower collateral blood flow in the rat than in other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This should be taken into account when the effect of pharmacological agents is studied in rats </plain></SENT>
