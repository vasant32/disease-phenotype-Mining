<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since several neuroprotectives failed to reproduce promising preclinical results under clinical conditions, efforts emerged to implement clinically relevant endpoints in animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereby, insufficient attention was given on autonomic reactions due to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although clinical trials reported on high functional and prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study focused on autonomic consequences and body weight changes in a translational relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and investigated interrelations to different outcome measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight rats underwent thromboembolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) while recording heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After assessing early functional impairment (Menzies score), animals were assigned to control procedure or potentially neuroprotective treatment with normobaric (NBO) or hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four or 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, functional impairment was re-assessed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin administered intravenously obtaining leakage-related blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight was documented prior to MCAO and 4 or 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During MCAO, HR was found to increase significantly while MAP decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amount of changes in HR was positively correlated with early functional impairment (P = 0.001): Severely affected animals provided an increase of 15.2 compared to 0.8 beats/minute in rats with low impairment (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding body weight, a decrease of 9.4% within 24 hours after MCAO occurred, but treatment-specific alterations showed no significant correlations with respective functional or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should routinely include autonomic parameters to allow inter-group comparisons and better understanding of autonomic reactions due to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, autonomic consequences might represent a useful outcome parameter enhancing the methodological spectrum of preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
