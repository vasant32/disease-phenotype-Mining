<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatments that could extend the therapeutic window of opportunity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early administration of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proven neuroprotective in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine: 1) whether delayed HBOT after permanent MCAo (pMCAo) can still convey neuroprotection and restorative cell proliferation, and 2) whether these beneficial effects rely on HBO-induced activation of protein phosphatase-1γ (PP1-γ) leading to a decreased phosphorylation and ubiquitination of CREB and hence its stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed in one hundred thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats with the body weight ranging from 240 to 270g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAo was induced with the intraluminal filament occluding the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, HBOT (2.5 ATA, 1h daily for 10days) was started 48h after pMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> response element-binding protein (CREB) expression and BrdU-DAB staining in the hippocampus and the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region were evaluated on day 14 and day 28 post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, HBOT (2.5 ATA, 1h) was started 3h after pMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of CREB siRNA or PP1-γ siRNA on HBO-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size alterations and target protein expression were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HBOT started with 48h delay reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, ameliorated neurobehavioral deficits and increased protein expression of CREB, resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferations</z:mp> in the hippocampus and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, on day 14 and day 28 post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiment pMCAo resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and functional deterioration and reduced brain expression of PP1-γ, which led to increased phosphorylation and ubiquitination of CREB 24h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However HBOT administered 3h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reversed these molecular events and resulted in CREB stabilization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size reduction and neurobehavioral improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gene silencing with CREB siRNA or PP1-γ siRNA reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beneficial effects of HBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, delayed daily HBOT presented as potent neuroprotectant in pMCAo rats, increased CREB expression and signaling activity, and bolstered regenerative type cell proliferation in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As shown in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiment these effects of HBO were likely to be mediated by reducing ubiquitin-dependent CREB degradation owing to HBO-induced activation of PP1γ </plain></SENT>
