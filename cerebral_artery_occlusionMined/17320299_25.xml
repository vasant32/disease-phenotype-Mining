<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stem cells provide a promising form of therapy to replace neuronal circuits lost to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous studies have shown that a variety of stem cell types can provide some functional recovery in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unlikely that replacement therapy alone will be sufficient to maximize recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine if rodent stem cell transplants combined with rehabilitation resulted in enhanced functional recovery after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced by injection of the vasoconstrictive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 adjacent to the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the rats received adult neural stem cell transplants isolated from mouse subventricular zone or vehicle injection and then subsequently were housed in enriched or standard conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rats in the enriched housing also had access to running wheels once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enriched housing and voluntary running exercise enhanced migration of transplanted stem cells toward the region of injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and there was a trend toward increased survival of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enrichment also increased the number of endogenous progenitor cells in the subventricular zone of transplanted animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, functional recovery measured in the cylinder test was facilitated only when the stem cell transplants were combined with enrichment and running exercise 7 days after the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the ability of transplanted stem cells in promoting recovery can be augmented by environmental factors such as rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
