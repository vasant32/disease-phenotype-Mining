<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from middle cerebral artery wall (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion results in increased expression of cerebrovascular endothelin and angiotensin receptors and activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as well as reduced local cerebral blood flow and increased levels of pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesised that inhibition of the cerebrovascular inflammatory reaction with a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) to block transcription or a combined receptor blockade would reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improve neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to a 2-hours middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of treated animals were studied; (i) one group received intraperitoneal administration of a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) starting at 0, 6, or 12 hours after the occlusion, and (ii) a second group received two specific receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (a combination of the angiotensin AT1 receptor inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">Candesartan</z:chebi> and the endothelin <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ZD1611), given immediately after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral arteries, microvessels and brain tissue were harvested; and the expressions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1ss (IL-1ss), interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38 and JNK were analysed using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 25 +/- 2% of total brain volume, and reduced neurological function 2 days after MCAO followed by 48 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1ss, IL-6 and iNOS, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in smooth muscle cells of ischemic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and in associated intracerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>U0126, given intraperitoneal at zero or 6 hours after the ischemic event, but not at 12 hours, reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (11.7 +/- 2% and 15 +/- 3%, respectively), normalized pERK1/2, and prevented elevation of the expressions of TNF-alpha IL-1ss, IL-6 and iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined inhibition of angiotensin AT1 and endothelin <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors decreased the volume of brain damaged (12.3 +/- 3; P &lt; 0.05) but only slightly reduced MCAO-induced enhanced expression of iNOS and cytokines CONCLUSION: The present study shows elevated microvascular expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1ss, IL-6 and iNOS following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and shows that this expression is transcriptionally regulated via the MEK/ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
