<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the optimal dose and time window for the neuroprotective effect of VEGF when administrated after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion was induced by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a dose response experiment, low (1.25 ng/μL), middle (2.5 ng/μL) and high (5.0 ng/μL) doses of VEGF were administered 2h after MCAO by the route of perifocal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VEGF at a dose of middle (2.5 ng/μL) displayed excellent effects on neuroprotective efficacy for focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, 2.5 ng/μL VEGF was administered at times varying from 2 to 8h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, water content and neurological deficits were significantly reduced when VEGF was given at 2 and 3h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was less when the same dose was given at the later times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present findings indicated that VEGF reduced ischemic neuronal danger with a therapeutic time window within the first 3h of transient MCAO and may be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
