<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent availability of transgenic mice has led to a burgeoning number of reports describing the effects of specific gene products on the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> models in rats have been well described, descriptions of a murine model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are scant and sources of potential experimental variability remain undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that slight technical modifications would produce widely discrepant results in a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that controlling surgical and procedural conditions could lead to reproducible physiological and anatomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we established a murine model that would permit either permanent or transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study provides a detailed description of the surgical technique and reveals important differences among strains commonly used in the production of transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to strain-related differences, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological outcome, and cerebral blood flow appear to be importantly affected by temperature during the ischemic and postischemic periods, mouse size, and the size of the suture that obstructs the vascular lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When these variables were kept constant, there was remarkable uniformity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize the protective effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and might help to standardize techniques among different laboratories to provide a cohesive framework for evaluating the results of future studies in transgenic animals </plain></SENT>
