<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The differentially expressed brain protein profile was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (control group) and SHR-SP using two-dimensional fluorescent difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> indicators including total antioxidation capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) activity, and maleic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38124">dialdehyde</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lastly, SHR-SP were randomly divided into untreated and treated (<z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg/day) and E (100 mg/kg/day)) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment for 4 weeks, half of the animals were sacrificed for detection of <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>, GPx, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with SHR, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of SHR-SP was larger (P &lt; 0.01), and the antioxidative proteins including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) Pi2 and GST A5 were lower; <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> and GPx activities were decreased and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, and increased <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> and GPx activity significantly in SHR-SP, while also decreasing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
