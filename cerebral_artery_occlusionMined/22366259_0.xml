<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A potent neuroprotective effect of ischemic postconditioning has previously been described using cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but this is not a practical therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study has been performed to determine whether postconditioning by mild episodes of hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (hypoxic postconditioning, HP) can reduce post-hypoxic brain injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were submitted to severe hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (180 Torr, 3 h) followed by HP (360 Torr, 2 h, 3 trials spaced at 24 h) starting either 3h (early HP) or 24 h (delayed HP) after severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structural and functional brain injury was assessed by a complex of histological techniques, behavioral methods, and by testing the functions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that early and delayed HP considerably attenuated post-hypoxic injury, reducing pyknosis, hyperchromatosis, and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, as well as the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in hippocampus and neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed HP produced prominent anxiolytic effect on rat behavior, preventing development of post-hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both modes of HP had beneficial effect on the functioning of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>, but only delayed HP normalized completely the baseline <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> activity and its reactivity to stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results obtained demonstrate that postconditioning by using repetitive episodes of mild hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> may provide a powerful neuroprotective procedure that can be easily adopted for clinical practice and recommended as a research tool for identification of endogenous mechanisms involved in post-ischemic neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
