<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen adult cats underwent transorbital occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven cats the ipsilateral SEP's were abolished after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and did not show any recovery after 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same seven cats showed the greatest area of moderate and severe ischemic neuronal changes, ranging from 21 to 64% (mean 39 +/- 14%) of the total ipsilateral cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining eight cats showed a complete flattening or decreased amplitude of the SEP after occlusion, but demonstrated a considerable recovery in the amplitude of the primary cortical potential during the six hours of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cats had ischemic areas of less than 15% (mean 9 +/- 3%) of the total ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the disappearance of the SEP and their failure to recover correlate with the extent and degree of histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
