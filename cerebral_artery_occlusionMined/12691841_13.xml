<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In other forms of injury, cellular protection with HBO is associated with diminished infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HBO given prior to or after MCAO reduces PMN infiltration into the brain, and that decreased PMN infiltration is associated with improved functional and anatomic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty rats underwent MCAO and were randomized to pretreatment with HBO (3 ATA) immediately prior to (n=13), or posttreatment immediately after surgery (n=12), or to control (air 1 ATA) (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five rats underwent sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcome was measured at 24 h in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (n=22) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (n=23) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MPO activity was significantly higher in controls (mean 0.28, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0.17-0.38) than in the HBO pretreatment group (0.12, 0.08-0.16), HBO posttreatment group (0.16, 0.13-0.19), and the sham group (0.02, -0.02 to 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HBO treated animals also had better neurologic outcomes (pretreatment 1.5, 0.9-2.1, posttreatment 2.6, 2.0-3.2) and smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (pretreatment 27%, 18-37%, posttreatment 28%, 19-37%) than controls (neurologic outcome 3.7, 3.1-4.4, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 39%, 30-48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcomes correlate better with MPO activity (R(2)=0.75) than with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (R(2)=0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data confirm the neuroprotective effects of HBO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and suggest that the mechanism of this action may involve inhibition of PMN infiltration in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
