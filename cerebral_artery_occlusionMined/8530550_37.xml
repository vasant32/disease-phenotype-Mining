<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) elicited a rapid reduction in MAP2 immunostaining that was visible 1 h post-MCAO and that increased in intensity and area encompassed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion borders were well defined by loss of MAP2 immunostaining, but alterations in staining within the lesion were more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume increased significantly from 1 to 4 h post-MCAO (from 63.8 +/- 10.8 to 111.3 +/- 19.0 mm3, mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, MAP2 immunostaining is a sensitive, quantifiable indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
