<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Conscious Wistar rats with stereotaxically and unilaterally implanted cannula just above the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were injected with the powerful vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 (ET1, 60 pmol in 3 microl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to examine the long-term (from the 1st to the 14th day) changes in neuronal bioelectrical activity together with sensorimotor deficits after ET1-induced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded from the ipsilateral fronto-parietal cortical area (supplied by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and sensorimotor behavior (one postural reflex test and six limb placing tests) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant suppression of the multi-unit activity was observed until the 14th day post-ET1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats exhibited significant unilateral sensorimotor deficits with a maximum at the 3-7 days after ET1 and a spontaneous partial recovery by days 11-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the suppression of the multi-unit activity and the sensorimotor deficits between the 3rd and the 10th day post-ET1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that studying the bioelectrical activity in combination with the behavioral sensorimotor functions may be of use to assess the functional disturbances associated with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and would help to examine the therapeutic benefits of various cerebroprotective treatments before initiating human clinical trials </plain></SENT>
