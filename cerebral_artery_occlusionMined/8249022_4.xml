<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be effective in detailing regions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in which water proton translations or motions have been slowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The corresponding perfusion patterns, however, have not been correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, the hemodynamics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic tissues and the changes due to mild insults are also not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study describes high-speed MRI techniques and observations found in the early detection of regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gradient-echo and spin-echo-planar MRI was used with middle cerebral artery balloon occluders to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Apparent diffusion fell within minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and correlated with near-total or total perfusion deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactive hyperemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, and vasodilatation appeared to be changed in ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of early ischemic events is dramatically improved when the motions of water (apparent diffusion), delivery of water (perfusion), and response to hemodynamic perturbations (regulatory response) are measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> can be accomplished with high-speed MRI techniques described herein </plain></SENT>
