<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, rapid accumulation and activation of neutrophils in the ischaemic region is deleterious due to release of reactive oxygen species and myeloperoxidase (MPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine whether AM-36, both a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> channel blocker and an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, afforded neuroprotection by modulating neutrophil accumulation into brain, following endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: AM-36 was administered at 3 and 24 h after ET-1-induced MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was determined using grid-walking and cylinder tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image analysis of brain sections was used to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of AM-36 on neutrophil infiltration and their interaction with macrophages was examined in rats at 48 h following MCAo by both an MPO assay and double-label immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown was measured by the area stained by intravenous Evans Blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: AM-36 reduced functional deficits in both tests such that no difference existed from pre-ischaemic values at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration, assessed by MPO activity, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were significantly reduced following AM-36 administration by 54 and 60% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, immunofluorescence revealed that AM-36 reduced neutrophil infiltration by approximately 50% in selected brain regions, when compared to controls, and also modulated macrophage phagocytosis of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breakdown of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was significantly reduced by 60% following AM-36 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that AM-36 can directly modulate the neutrophil <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and reduce <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown following MCAo </plain></SENT>
