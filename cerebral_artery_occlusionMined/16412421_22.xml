<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine how cytokine transport systems at the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) participate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> progression and recovery, we generated a mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 1 h of occlusion followed by nearly complete reperfusion, the neurological deficits lasted more than a week as shown by several behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the prominent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area indicated by reduced cerebral perfusion and confirmed by vital staining, the volume of distribution of (131)I-albumin in various brain regions was not significantly altered over time (12 h to 14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, the blood-to-brain permeation of 125I-TNFalpha was significantly increased 5 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, excess unlabeled TNFalpha abolished this enhanced 125I-TNFalpha uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, not only did the known saturable transport system for TNFalpha persist, but it functioned at a higher capacity in tMCAO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 partially explains the increased transport, as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for both receptors showed the most pronounced increase (15-fold and 30-fold, respectively) in the ischemic hemisphere 5-7 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, even in the hemisphere contralateral to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there was increased TNFalpha transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bilateral increase in 125I-TNFalpha entry from blood to brain suggests that TNFalpha trafficking in cerebral endothelial cells is influenced by global mediators in addition to the transporting receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the known multiple modulatory effects of TNFalpha after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the results indicate that the TNFalpha transport system at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> facilitates neuroplasticity and plays an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
