<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of oxidative DNA damage and repair in brain injury after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, the authors investigated DNA base damage and DNA base excision repair (BER) capacity, the predominant repair mechanism for oxidative DNA lesions, in the rat model of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contents of 8-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic site (AP site), hallmarks of oxidative DNA damage, were quantitatively measured in nuclear DNA extracts from brains 0.25 to 72 hours after 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In parallel to the detection of DNA lesions, the capacity for 8-oxodG- or AP site-dependent DNA repair synthesis was measured in nuclear protein extracts using specific in vitro DNA repair assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After postischemic reperfusion, the levels of 8-oxodG and AP sites were markedly increased in ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In frontal/parietal cortex, regions that survived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 8-oxodG and AP sites were efficiently repaired during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the caudate, a region that was destined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the DNA lesions were poorly repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In consistent with the patterns of endogenous lesion repair, a markedly induced and long-lasting (at least 72 hours) BER activity was detected in the cortex but not in the caudate after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induced BER activity in ischemic cortex was attributed to the upregulation of gene expression and activation of selective BER enzymes, particularly DNA polymerase-beta and OGG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that inducible DNA BER constitutes an important endogenous mechanism that protects brain against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced oxidative neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
