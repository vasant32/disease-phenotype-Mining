<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Striatal enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) acts in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to dephosphorylate a number of important proteins involved in synaptic function including ERK and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins are also linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> triggers a complex cascade of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that STEP is regulated at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels in rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that its regulation may play a role in the outcome of ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, there are profound decreases in the levels of STEP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whilst in global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> STEP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is selectively down-regulated in areas susceptible to ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a neuroprotective preconditioning paradigm, and in regions of the brain that are relatively resistant to ischemic damage, STEP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a significant processing of STEP after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to generate a novel species, STEP(33), resulting in a redistribution of STEP from membrane-bound to soluble compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with the cleavage of mature forms of STEP, there are changes in the phosphorylation state of ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that the cleavage of STEP leads to a catalytically active form, but this cleaved form no longer binds to and dephosphorylates its substrate pERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in response to ischemic insults, there are profound reductions in both the amount and the activity of STEP, its localization, as well as the activity of one of its key substrates, pERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes in STEP may reflect a critical role in the outcomes of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
