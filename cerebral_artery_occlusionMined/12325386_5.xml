<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat is a commonly used model to evaluate new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many such studies rely on short-term neurological examination and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as endpoint measures while neglecting more long-term functional assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether there were changes in passive avoidance behavior, spontaneous behavioral patterns across the light-dark cycle, and motor coordination as measured on the rotorod test 1 month after Sprague-Dawley rats had undergone MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to age-matched controls, fewer animals in the MCAO group remained on the platform during the passive avoidance retention test (p &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the groups were observed in the spontaneous activity during the initial portions of both the light and dark testing periods, when the test situation was new (p &lt; .01 to .05, depending on the variable examined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any differences on the rotorod test failed to gain statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that at least the passive avoidance test and measures of spontaneous activity are sensitive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced damage over a more prolonged survival period and therefore may be appropriate measures for long-term effectiveness of new treatments </plain></SENT>
