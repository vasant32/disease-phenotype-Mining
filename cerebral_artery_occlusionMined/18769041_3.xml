<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined whether there is a close link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and arrhythmogenesis in rats as well as its possible electrophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic model was made by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormality was as high as 75.71% and the myocardium was severely damaged after MCAO 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The normalized peak currents of I(Ca,L) in ventricular myocytes investigated by whole-cell patch clamp were larger in cerebral ischemic rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> than those in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca,L) was shifted to more positive potentials and recovery of I(Ca,L) from inactivation was accelerated significantly, but the activation of I(Ca,L) was not influenced in cerebral ischemic rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile the action potential duration (APD) of ventricular myocytes was prolonged obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The [Ca(2+)](i) induced by KCL in ventricular myocytes was also significantly increased by scanning confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of alpha(1C)/Ca(V)1.2 detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis was also increased in myocardium of cerebral ischemic rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the up-regulation in function and expression of L-type Ca(2+) channel as well as [Ca(2+)](i) increasing in cardiac myocytes of cerebral ischemic rats may provide mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
