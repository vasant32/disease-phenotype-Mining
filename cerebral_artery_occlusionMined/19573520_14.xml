<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed an up-regulated expression of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 in the ischemic brain following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to the brain of sham-operated rats, the expression of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 was increased in the ischemic striatum at day 1 of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3+ cells in the ischemic brain was further increased at day 2 and day 3, and peaked at day 7 of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The up-regulated expression of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 persisted from day 14 to 2 months after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed co-localization of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 with OX-42+ cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ and ED1+ cells, suggesting that activated microglia/infiltrating macrophages and activated astrocytes are the primary source of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro setting, <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 treatment dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells and neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blockade of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 activity by infusing a neutralizing antibody against <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 into the ischemic striatum decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and the proliferation of neural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 expressed by activated microglia/infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes in the ischemic brain may play a role in post-ischemic tissue remodeling by enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
