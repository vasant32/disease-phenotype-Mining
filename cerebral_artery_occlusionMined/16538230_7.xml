<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative diffusion- (DWI), perfusion- (PWI), T(2)-weighted (T(2)WI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed before, during, and up to 1 day after 20-mins transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO; n=6) or sham operation (n=6) in male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Viability thresholds were employed to calculate diffusion, perfusion, and T(2) lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Region of interest analysis was used to evaluate structural and functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes within the sensorimotor network, which were then related to corresponding behavioral measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was performed 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced lesions on DWI and PWI, which fully recovered by 30 mins after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilesional fMRI responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> and forepaw stimulation were significantly impaired after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and did not fully normalize until 3 and 24 h after tMCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were observed on imaging or TTC at 24 h despite significant behavioral dysfunctions including contralesional forelimb impairment and ipsilesional neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No MRI, behavioral, or TTC anomalies were observed in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between MRI parameters, behavior, and TTC in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings on diffusion, perfusion, and T(2) imaging shortly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> may not indicate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue status as indicated by fMRI and behavior, which may help explain the persistence of neurologic deficits in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conventional MRI after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
