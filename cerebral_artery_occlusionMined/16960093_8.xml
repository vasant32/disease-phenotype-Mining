<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with lower prethrombolysis cerebral blood flow (CBF) were at a higher risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (sICH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent quantitative CBF assessment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> CT studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis for a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or internal carotid artery terminus occlusion within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out to determine predictors of sICH post-IA thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to determine the association between mean ipsilateral CBF and the occurrence of sICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of our cohort was 68+/-12 years and a mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of 18+/-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, patients with higher percent of core <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and reduced mean ipsilateral CBF were at risk of sICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis only mean ipsilateral CBF was associated with higher rates of sICH (odds ratio 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.51; P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97; P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower pre-IA thrombolysis mean ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> CBF are at significantly higher risk for sICH in the setting of a <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or carotid terminus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The threshold identified in this study may be useful for selection of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
