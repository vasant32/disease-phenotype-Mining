<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 is crucial for axonal guidance by interacting with its receptors, deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and uncoordinated gene 5H (UNC5H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and UNC5H are also dependence receptors inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when unbound by netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study is to investigate the role of netrin-1 and its receptors in ipsilateral ventroposterior thalamic nucleus (VPN) injury secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Renovascular hypertensive Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of netrin-1 (600ng/d for 7 days) or vehicle (IgG/Fc) was given 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was evaluated by postural reflex 8 and 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, immunoreactivity was determined in ipsilateral VPN for NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein, netrin-1 and its receptors (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and UNC5H2), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected with TUNEL assay, and the expressions of caspase-3, netrin-1, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, and UNC5H2 were quantified by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO resulted in the impaired postural reflex after 8 and 14 days, with decreased NeuN marked neurons and increased TUNEL positive cells, as well as an up-regulation in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and UNC5H2 protein in ipsilateral VPN, without significant change in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> or netrin-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By exogenous netrin-1 infusion, the number of neurons was increased in ipsilateral VPN, and both TUNEL positive cell number and caspase-3 protein level were reduced, while UNC5H2 expression remained unaffected, simultaneously, the impairment of postural reflex was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present study indicates that exogenous netrin-1 could rescue neuron loss by attenuating secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ipsilateral VPN after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, possibly via its receptor UNC5H2, suggesting that relative insufficiency of endogenous netrin-1 be an underlying mechanism of secondary injury in VPN post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
