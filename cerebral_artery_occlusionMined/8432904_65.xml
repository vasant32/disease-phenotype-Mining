<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the microglial reaction that accompanies cortical infarction induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lectin histochemistry with the B4-isolectin from Griffonia simplicifolia as well as immunocytochemistry with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and lymphocytic antigens were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal attention was focused on neocortical and thalamic regions, representative of primary and secondary ischemic damage, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the lectin procedure, activated microglial cells were abundant in the neocortex 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, microglial activation in the thalamus was not apparent until day 2 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 5, MHC class II antigen was expressed by reactive microglia in fiber tracts traversing the striatum, but was absent from activated microglia in the primary cortical infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MHC class I and lymphocytic antigens were expressed differentially on microglia with class I antigens appearing early and lymphocytic antigens appearing late in the time course after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings are compatible with previous studies during global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and confirm the early activation and the progressive nature of immunomolecule expression on activated microglia after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to neocortical and thalamic sites, our results showed an early microglial activation to be present also in forebrain regions outside of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory, such as the contralateral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A unilateral microglial reaction was also detectable after long-term survival (&gt; or = 4 weeks) in the pyramidal tracts, as well as in the corticospinal tracts at cervical but not lumbar spinal cord levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal damage, as evaluated by Nissl staining, was found only in cortical and thalamic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the demonstration of reactive microglia indicates not only imminent ischemic neuronal damage within <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory but can also delineate extra-focal disturbances, possibly reflecting subtle and transitory changes in neuronal activity </plain></SENT>
