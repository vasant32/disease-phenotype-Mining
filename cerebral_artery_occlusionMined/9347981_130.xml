<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine if <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> protect female rats from the neurodegenerative effects of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were ovariectomized and 7 or 8 days later various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> preparations were administered before or after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (17beta-E2) or a brain-targeted 17beta-E2 chemical delivery system (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e>) decreased mortality from 65% in ovariectomized rats to 22% in 17beta-E2-treated and 16% in 17beta-E2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This marked reduction in mortality was accompanied by a reduction in the ischemic area of the brain from 25.6+/-5.7% in the ovariectomized rats to 9.8+/-4% and 9.1+/-4.2% in the 17beta-E2-implanted and the 17beta-E2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e>-treated rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, pretreatment with the presumed inactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17160">17alpha-estradiol</z:chebi>, reduced mortality from 36 to 0% and reduced the ischemic area by 55 to 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When administered 40 or 90 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 17beta-E2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> reduced the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by 45 to 90% or 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the present study provides the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> exert neuroprotective effects in an animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and suggests that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> may be a useful therapy to protect neurons against the neurodegenerative effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
