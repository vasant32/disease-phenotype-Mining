<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Annexin A5 has been suggested as a marker for imaging cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under various disease conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, C57BL6/N mice received middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were injected intravenously with either active or inactive Cy5.5-annexin A5 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some mice also received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI), a cell integrity marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in mice receiving active Cy5.5-annexin A5 were fluorescence intensities significantly higher over the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAO than on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was detected noninvasively and ex vivo 4 and 8 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of cells positive for fluorescent annexin A5 were also positive for PI and fragmented DNA as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16450">2'-deoxyuridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the high specificity of annexin A5 for visualization of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the distribution of injected active and inactive annexin A5, PI, and TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It provides important information on the experimental and potential clinical applications of annexin A5-based imaging agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
