<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, activation of NF-kappaB was studied after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of p65 and p50, protein subunits of NF-kappaB, was examined by Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry for p65 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-labelling with specific markers for astroglia and microglia was used for cell type identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurons located within and surrounding the ischemic core were identified during the first 24 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by using an antibody against 72-kDa heat shock protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB binding activity was evaluated at different times post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed constitutive expression of p65 and p50, and NF-kappaB binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal p65 was seen in certain neurons and resting astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Constitutive NF-kappaB binding activity was attributable to one main protein complex possibly formed in neurons and astrocytes, although two minor complexes were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 day post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> selective induction of p65 was seen in neurons located in a penumbra-like area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this time, however, no disturbances of basal NF-kappaB binding activity were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed delayed induction of p65 several days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas no changes were detected for p50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From 4 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a substantial increase in the amount of p65 was detected due to induction in reactive astrocytes and microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was correlated with a robust enhancement of NF-kappaB binding activity with formation of three major specific complexes binding DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the highly inducible NF-kappaB complexes resulted from induction of p65 and activation of NF-kappaB in post-ischemic reactive glia </plain></SENT>
