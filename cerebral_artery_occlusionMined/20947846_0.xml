<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anamnestic recall of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related deficits is a common clinical observation, especially during periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of this transient re-emergence of neurological dysfunction is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats underwent 3 hours middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or saline at the time of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp> (DTH) response to myelin basic protein was examined 28 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in behavioral outcomes were assessed after DTH testing and repeat administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or saline at 34 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of euthanasia (36 days), the immunologic response of splenocytes to myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase, and proteolipid protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and the number of lymphocytes in the brain determined by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> at middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had a greater DTH response to myelin basic protein than animals treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those animals that had fully recovered on a given behavioral test before DTH testing, those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> at middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> displayed more neurological deterioration after DTH testing and had more CD8(+) lymphocytes within the ischemic core of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Th1 immune response to brain antigens in the spleen was more robust among those animals that deteriorated after DTH testing and there were more CD4(+) lymphocytes in the penumbral region of animals with a Th1 response to myelin basic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that an immune response to the brain contributes to the phenomenon of anamnestic recall of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related deficits after an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the immune response to this phenomenon deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
