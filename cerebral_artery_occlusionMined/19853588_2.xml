<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (60 min) and 2-24 hr reperfusion in rats, we observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) induced up-regulation of PPAR gamma protein expression and translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found that PPAR gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> enhanced whereas PPAR gamma <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GW9662 inhibited the alteration of PPAR gamma stimulated by I/R, suggesting that the changes of PPAR gamma may result from the activation by endogenous ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the link between the 12/15-lipoxygenase and the production of activating ligands for PPAR gamma has been proved in various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the relation of them in brain tissue has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the I/R-induced PPAR gamma alteration was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi>, the specific inhibitor of 12/15-lipoxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">Baicalein</z:chebi> treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation of PPAR gamma expression and, furthermore, suppressed PPAR gamma nuclear accumulation as well as maintained PPAR gamma cytoplasmic retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that I/R induces both PPAR gamma expression and translocation, probably through the activation by endogenous ligands in a 12/15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>-sensitive way </plain></SENT>
