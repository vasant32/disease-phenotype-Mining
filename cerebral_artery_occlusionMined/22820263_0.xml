<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background and purpose: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) is a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor and is associated with poor recovery compared with nondiabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in diabetic and non-diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Type-1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1DM) was induced by injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-T1DM and T1DM rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without tPA 2h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes and immunostaining for advanced glycation endproducts receptor (RAGE), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Western blotting were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: tPA treatment of WT-MCAo rats significantly improved the functional outcome and reduced the lesion volume compared with non-treatment WT-MCAo rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between treatment with or without tPA in the WT-MCAo group in brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, RAGE, MMP-9 and TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, tPA treatment in T1DM-MCAo rats (T1DM-MCAo+tPA) significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005238'>enlarged brain</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, augmented <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, and failed to decrease lesion volume and improve functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to T1DM-MCAo control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>tPA treatment also significantly increased the expression of RAGE, MMP-9 and TLR4 in the ischemic brain in T1DM-MCAo rats compared with T1DM-MCAo control rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was significantly correlated with functional deficit and RAGE and TLR4 expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with tPA increased brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and failed to improve functional outcome in T1DM rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> may contribute to the failed neuroprotective effects of tPA treatment in T1DM rats </plain></SENT>
