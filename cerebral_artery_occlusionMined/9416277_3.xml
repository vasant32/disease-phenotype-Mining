<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The individual respiratory chain complexes also exhibited selective vulnerability to a focal cerebral ischemic lesion, with significant impairment of complex I activity in the lesioned hemisphere of both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age related decline in complex I activity may be important in the enhanced susceptibility of the aging brain to ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
