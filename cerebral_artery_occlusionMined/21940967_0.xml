<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its effect on diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of BMSCs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in Type 1 diabetic (T1DM) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T1DM was induced in adult male Wistar rats by injecting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic and T1DM rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), treated with or without BMSCs (3Ã—10(6)) at 24 hours after MCAO, and monitored for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Functional benefit was not detected in T1DM-MCAO treated with BMSC rats compared with corresponding T1DM-MCAO controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMSC treatment in T1DM-MCAO rats had increased mortality, blood-brain barrier leakage, brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery neointimal formation and cerebral arteriole narrowing/occlusion were also observed in T1DM-MCAO+BMSCs rats compared with T1DM-MCAO controls (P&lt;0.05), but not in nondiabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further studied the underlying mechanisms responsible for BMSC-induced blood-brain barrier leakage and accelerated vascular damage in T1DM-MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of angiogenin (an angiogenic factor) and ED1 (a marker for macrophages) was significantly increased in the T1DM-MCAO+BMSC rats in the ischemic brain and internal carotid artery compared with nontreated T1DM-MCAO rats, but not in nondiabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMSC therapy in T1DM-MCAO rats does not improve functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, it increases blood-brain barrier leakage and cerebral artery neointimal formation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, which possibly is due to increased expression of angiogenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, BMSC treatment starting 24 hours after MCAO may not be beneficial for diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
