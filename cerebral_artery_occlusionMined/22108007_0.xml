<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying secondary degeneration are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to determine the occurrence and contribution of autophagy to the thalamic degeneration after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was induced by distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autophagic activation, Beclin 1 expression and amyloid β (Aβ) deposits were determined by immunofluorescence, immunoblot and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary damage to thalamus was assessed with Nissl staining and immunofluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined using TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contribution of autophagy to the secondary damage was evaluated by shRNA-mediated downregulation of Beclin 1 and the autophagic inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> (3-MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential role of Aβ in autophagic activation was determined with N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32433">L-alanyl</z:chebi>]-S-phenylglycine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">t-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (DAPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the conversion of LC3-II, the formation of autophagosomes, and the levels of activated cathepsin B and Beclin 1 were significantly increased in the ipsilateral thalamus at 7 and 14 days after MCAO (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both Beclin 1 knockdown and 3-MA treatment significantly reduced LC3-II conversion and autophagosome formation, which were accompanied by obvious decreases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ipsilateral thalamus (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, DAPT treatment markedly reduced Aβ deposits, which coincided with decreases in LC3-II conversion and autophagosome formation (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of autophagy by Beclin 1 knockdown can attenuate the secondary thalamic damage after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Aβ deposits may be involved in the activation of autophagy </plain></SENT>
