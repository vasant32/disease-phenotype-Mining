<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chemokine CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 are constitutively expressed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used in vivo murine models of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) to investigate the protective potential of CX3CL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that exogenous CX3CL1 reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, neurological deficits, and caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CX3CL1-induced neuroprotective effects were long lasting, being observed up to 50 d after pMCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective action of CX3CL1 in different models of brain injuries is mediated by its inhibitory activity on microglia and, in vitro, requires the activation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor 1 (A₁R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that, in the presence of the A₁R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine and in A₁R⁻/⁻ mice, the neuroprotective effect of CX3CL1 on pMCAO was abolished, indicating the critical importance of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> system in CX3CL1 protection also in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In apparent contrast with the above reported data but in agreement with previous findings, cx3cl1⁻/⁻ and cx3cr1(GFP/GFP) mice, respectively, deficient in CX3CL1 or CX3CR1, had less severe brain injury on pMCAO, and the administration of exogenous CX3CL1 increased brain damage in cx3cl1⁻/⁻ ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report that CX3CL1 induced a different phagocytic activity in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and cx3cl1⁻/⁻ microglia in vitro during cotreatment with the medium conditioned by neurons damaged by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of CX3CL1 reduces ischemic damage via an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-dependent mechanism and that the absence of constitutive CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling changes the outcome of microglia-mediated effects during CX3CL1 administration to ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
