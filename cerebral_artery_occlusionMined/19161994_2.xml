<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated changes in free fatty acids (FFAs) following intravenous human MSC (hMSC) transplantation into rats that had undergone transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 2-hours MCAo, followed by intravenous transplantation of hMSC or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at one day after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were sacrificed 5 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic profiling of free fatty acids (FFAs) level was assessed in plasma and brain from control rats (n=8), PBS-treated MCAo rats (n=6), and hMSC-treated MCAo rats (MCAo+hMSC, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of some FFAs in plasma and brain samples of the MCAo and MCAo+hMSC groups were significantly different from those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage composition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28875">myristic acid</z:chebi> in plasma and those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28875">myristic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, and eicosenoic acid in brain tissues of the MCAo+hMSC group were significantly reduced compared to those in the untransplanted MCAo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our metabolic approach has provided insights into understanding the complexity of biochemical and physiological events that occur in ischemic brain injury and the transplantation effects of MSCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
