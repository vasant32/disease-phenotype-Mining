<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have assessed the ability of two TAT-fused <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> PYC36D-TAT and JNKI-1D-TAT (JNKI-1 or XG-102), which respectively inhibit jun proto-oncogene (c-Jun) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve functional outcome (adhesive tape removal) after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in Spontaneously Hypertensive (SH) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PYC36D-TAT and JNKI-1D-TAT <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> batches used for experiments were tested in vitro and protected cortical neurons against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated intravenously with three different doses of PYC36D-TAT (7.7, 76, or 255 nmol/kg), JNKI-1D-TAT (255 nmol/kg), D-TAT <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (255 nmol/kg), or saline (vehicle control), 10 minutes after reperfusion after 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrary to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, no treatment significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or improved functional score measurements compared with vehicle-treated animals when assessed 48 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, assessment of the JNKI-1D-TAT <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, when administered 1 or 2 hours after reperfusion after 90 minutes of MCAO, also did not improve histological or functional outcomes at 48 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to evaluate the efficacy of PYC36D-TAT and JNKI-1D-TAT using the SH rat, which has recently been shown to be more sensitive to AMPA receptor activation rather than to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and which may have contributed to the negative findings </plain></SENT>
