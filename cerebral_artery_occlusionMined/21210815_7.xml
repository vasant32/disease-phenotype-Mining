<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that levels of proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and nuclear respiratory factor-1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA content and other markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis and function were reduced in primary mouse cortical neurons under oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor SB216763 activated an efficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis program in control cortical neurons and counteracted the OGD-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by the activation of an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> response that reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species generation and ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro effects of SB216763 were mimicked by two other structurally unrelated GSK-3 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of SB216763 on OGD-mediated neuronal damage were abolished in the presence of diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, when systemically administered in vivo, SB216763 reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and recovered the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA in mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GSK-3 inhibition by SB216763 might pave the way of novel promising therapies aimed at stimulating the renewal of functional mitochondria and reducing reactive oxygen species-mediated damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
