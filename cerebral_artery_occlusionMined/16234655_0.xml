<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: In strictly selected cases of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, revascularization by extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass can be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interventional recanalization of the occlusion under direct surgical control has not been reported in the literature so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old Caucasian female patient had experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 15 years before she came to our attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At that time, occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was diagnosed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her neurological deficit resolved within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen years later, the patient experienced repeated numbness of her left-sided extremities, which was refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed an occluded M1 segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion computed tomography without and after <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> stimulation disclosed impaired cerebrovascular capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient was scheduled for EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> tree was exposed, and the occluded portion was found to be 10 mm long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We then decided to reopen the vessel by balloon dilation under direct visual control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A catheter was advanced to the M1 origin, where a glidewire was passed into the vessel lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With only a little help from the surgeon, it was surprisingly easy to direct the glidewire through the occluded segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At this time, flow through the M1 segment was re-established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Flow through the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> that had occluded for 15 years was re-established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of our experience, in nonatherosclerotic occlusions, intravascular intervention may be considered </plain></SENT>
