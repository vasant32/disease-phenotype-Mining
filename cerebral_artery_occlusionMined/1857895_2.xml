<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICP was repeatedly recorded before and after occlusion of the vessel via a narrow catheter placed in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was followed by an increase in ICP, and a pressure peak occurred after 12-24 h in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, essentially two patterns of ICP changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These seemed to be related to the severity of neurological deficits and extension of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the most severely affected animals, raised ICP was noted throughout the 1st week after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; in rats with reversible neurological deficits, ICP returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values after the first peak at 12-24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present investigation shows that prolonged ICP recording is feasible in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model in rats is well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ICP registration can be used in conjunction with other methods for evaluating treatment against increased ICP </plain></SENT>
