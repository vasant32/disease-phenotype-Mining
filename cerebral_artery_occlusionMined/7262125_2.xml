<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> consumption was similarly reduced in untreated cats but there was little difference between the control and drug-treated cats except in some areas where drug treatment appeared to further reduce the values for focal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> consumption </plain></SENT>
