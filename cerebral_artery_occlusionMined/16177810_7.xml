<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have highlighted a delayed secondary pathology developing after reperfusion in animals subjected to prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and recently we have shown that peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) occur not only during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but also in this delayed period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we study the electrocorticographic (ECoG) manifestations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> as signatures of developing secondary pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DC- and traditional AC-ECoG signals were recorded continuously from epidural, nonpolarizable electrodes during 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and 22 h of reperfusion in freely behaving rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During MCAo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> recurred frequently and their incidence was significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> ceased, and for the next several hours delta wave abnormalities dominated the ECoG with progressively increasing amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a variable period (5 to 15 h), the ECoG amplitude decremented with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a prolonged repetitive series of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> in this delayed phase produced transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> of the high amplitude ECoG signal, but thereafter the ECoG was persistently attenuated, with no transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> during subsequent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of postreperfusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>, and hence measures of ECoG attenuation, correlated with 24 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> could always be detected in baseline shifts of the AC-ECoG signal with a low high-pass cutoff setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that delayed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> after reperfusion contribute to a complex secondary pathology involving delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The manifestation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> in ECoG/electroencephalography recordings may enable continuous real-time monitoring of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression </plain></SENT>
