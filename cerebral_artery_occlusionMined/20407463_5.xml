<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of DMOG on the outcome after permanent and transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p/tMCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after pMCAO, rats were treated with 40 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg DMOG, or vehicle, and with 40 mg/kg or vehicle after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both doses significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, but only 40 mg/kg improved the behavior after 24 hours of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving 40 mg/kg were more likely to maintain rCBF values above 30% from the contralateral hemisphere within 24 hours of pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DMOG after tMCAO significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved behavior at 24 hours and 8 days and also improved the rCBF after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A consistent and significant upregulation of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) was associated with the observed neuroprotection, although this was not consistently related to HIF-1Î± levels at 24 hours and 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DMOG afforded neuroprotection both at 24 hours after pMCAO and at 24 hours and 8 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect was associated with an increase of VEGF and eNOS and was mediated by improved rCBF after DMOG treatment </plain></SENT>
