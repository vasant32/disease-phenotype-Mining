<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent reports have shown an increase in specific binding (in vitro) of [3H]PK 11195 to peripheral-type <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors in both experimental animals and humans, reflecting a glial/macrophagic reaction within and around focal ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography the time course of changes in brain uptake in vivo of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>-labeled PK 11195 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of central <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors) as indirect and direct markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, respectively, after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten anesthetized baboons were submitted to sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography studies between day 1 and day 91 after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies consisted of successive assessments, in the same <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography session, of [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PK 11195, [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi>, cerebral blood flow, and oxygen consumption; late computed tomographic scans were obtained to map the approximate contours of infarction and to define a concentric peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a significant time-dependent increase in [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PK 11195 uptake in the peri-infarcted area, maximum at 20 to 40 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a time- and perfusion-independent significant decrease in [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> uptake in the infarcted area, stable from day 2 onward, and already present in one baboon at day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Challenge studies with saturating doses of cold ligands confirmed that these changes represented alterations in specific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">Flumazenil</z:chebi> uptake was not affected in hypometabolic (but apparently noninfarcted, ie, deafferented) cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The delayed and apparently transient increases in [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]PK 11195 specific uptake in vivo presumably represent glial/macrophage reaction; the marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> specific binding, which appears selective for synaptic damage, is both precocious and sustained and thus may be better suited for the early assessment of ischemic damage in humans </plain></SENT>
