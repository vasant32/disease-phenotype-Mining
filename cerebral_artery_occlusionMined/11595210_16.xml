<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3-Aminobenzamide (3-AB) is a selective inhibitor of PARP that can significantly reduce brain damage after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats and displays a low toxicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to determine if inhibiting PARP with 3-AB has a long-term neuroprotective effect and if functional outcome improves in rats following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and treatment with 3-AB </plain></SENT>
