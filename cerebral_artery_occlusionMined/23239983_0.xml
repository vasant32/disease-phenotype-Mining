<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> have been shown to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury by inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16587">20-Hydroxyecdysone</z:chebi> (20E), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23897">ecdysteroid</z:chebi> hormone, exhibits antioxidative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the work described in this paper, we used an in vitro oxidative damage model and an in vivo ischemic model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of 20E and the mechanisms related to these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> led to neuronal injury, intracellular ROS/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi> generation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential dissipation, cellular <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potential descent, an increase in malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and an elevation of intracellular [Ca(2+)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were markedly attenuated by 20E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the activation of the ASK1-MKK4/7-JNK stress signaling pathway and cleaved caspase-3 induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were involved in the neuroprotection afforded by 20E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 20E reduced the expression of iNOS protein by inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of 20E was also confirmed in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>20E significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the neurological deficit score, restored <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potential and inhibited the increase in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and TUNEL-positive and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells in the cerebral cortex in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results support that 20E protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury by inhibiting ROS/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi> production and modulating <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced signal transduction pathways </plain></SENT>
