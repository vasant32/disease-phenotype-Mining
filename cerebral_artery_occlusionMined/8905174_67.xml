<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exogenous PROG has been shown to reduce secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in conjunction with attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the neuroprotective potential of PROG in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups, i.e. pretreatment with water soluble PROG, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) dissolved PROG, or DMSO as control or delayed treatment with DMSO dissolved PROG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced by insertion of an intraluminal suture and reperfusion was performed by withdrawing the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatments were initiated 30 min before MCAO via intraperitoneal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment was initiated upon reperfusion following 2 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre- and delayed treatment with DMSO dissolved PROG resulted in a 39% (P &lt; 0.05) and 34% (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, respectively, along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased body weight</z:hpo> loss and improved neurological function as compared to control animals, whereas no statistically significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by water soluble PROG was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that administration of PROG to the male rat before or 2 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO reduces ischemic cell damage and improves physiological and neurological function 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
