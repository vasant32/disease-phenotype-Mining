<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Previous studies demonstrated that mexiletine has some important features in the prevention of ischemic brain injury such as <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium canal blockage and free radical occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the effects of mexiletine on ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experiments were performed on 30 adult male Sprague- Dawley rats (285-425 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> following microcraniectomy and simultaneous bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three different treatments were included in this study: (a) "na√Øve" control group (no drug applied; n = 10); (b) "sham surgery" control group (only saline was applied; n = 10); and a (c) "treatment group (n = 10) where mexiletine was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h from ischemic insult, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were decapitated and prepared for immunocytochemical and histopathological analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated and compared using ANOVA and a Post- Hoc Bonferroni test in each group statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences between the treatment (81.98 +/- 12.58 mm?), control (121.57 +/- 11.41 mm?) and sham (116.08 +/- 12.36 mm?) groups (p &lt; 0,0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mexiletine should be considered as an alternative medication for prevention and treatment of ischemic brain injury due to its multipotent effects </plain></SENT>
