<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes a novel application of a multiparameter MRI analysis algorithm, the Eigenimage (EI) filter, to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EI is a linear filter that maximizes the projection of a desired tissue (ischemic tissue) while it minimizes the projection of undesired tissues (nonischemic tissue) onto a composite image called an eigenimage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats (n=26) were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2- and T1-weighted coronal MRI were acquired on separate groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were immediately sacrificed after each imaging session for histopathological analysis of tissue at 4-8 h, 16-24 h, and 48-168 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion areas from MRI were defined using EI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EI defined lesion areas were coregistered and warped to the corresponding histopathological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion as defined by EI exhibited ischemic cell damage ranging from scattered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cell damage to pan <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic cellular damage was not detected in homologous contralateral hemisphere regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EI lesion areas overlaid on histopathological sections were significantly correlated (r=0.92, p&lt;0.05) acutely, (r=0.98, p&lt;0.05) subacutely, and (r=0.99, p&lt;0.05) chronically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that EI methodology can accurately segment ischemic damage after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion from 4-168 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
