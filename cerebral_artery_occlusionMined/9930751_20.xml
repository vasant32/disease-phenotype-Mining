<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an intraluminal suture occlusion model of middle cerebral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats, 100 mg/kg MDL 72527 changed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation from 85.7 +/- 0.3 to 84.5 +/- 0.9% in cortex (p &lt; 0.05) and from 79.9 +/- 1.7 to 78.4 +/- 2.0% in subcortex (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury volume was reduced by 22% in the cortex (p &lt; 0.05) and 17% in the subcortex (p &lt; 0.05) after inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> oxidase by MDL 72527 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> levels together with a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> levels at the ischemic site compared with the nonischemic site after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> levels at the ischemic cortical and subcortical region was reduced by a mean of 45% with MDL 72527 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> interconversion pathway has an important role in the postischemic increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> levels and that blocking of this pathway can be neuroprotective against neuronal cell damage after temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
