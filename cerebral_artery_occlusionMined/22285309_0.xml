<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many neuroprotective actions of cannabinoids depend on the activation of specific receptors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether the CB2R and CB1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) protects neonatal brain against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion and whether anti-inflammatory mechanisms play a role in protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rats were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and injured rats were identified by diffusion-weighted MRI during the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, rats were subcutaneously administered 1 mg/kg of WIN or vehicle twice daily until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO led to increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CB2R (but not CB1R), chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CX3CR1), and cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα), as well as increased protein expression of chemokines <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1α and microglial activation 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WIN administration significantly reduced microglial activation at this point and attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and microglial accumulation and proliferation in the injured cortex 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulatively, our results show that the cannabinoid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> WIN protects against neonatal focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in part due to inhibitory effects on microglia </plain></SENT>
