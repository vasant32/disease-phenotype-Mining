<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ability of a novel neuronal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, SB 201823-A, to block central neuronal calcium influx in vitro and to reduce ischemic injury in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patch-clamp electrophysiology and intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> imaging in rat hippocampal and cerebellar neurons were used to determine effects on neuronal calcium channel activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in Fisher 344 rats and CD-1 mice to determine the effects on rodent focal ischemic injury and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular monitoring in conscious rats was conducted to determine cardiovascular liabilities of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In cultured rat hippocampal cells, calcium current measured at plateau was reduced by 36 +/- 8% and 89 +/- 4% after 5 and 20 mumol/L SB 201823-A, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cerebellar granule cells in culture, pretreatment with 2.5 mumol/L SB 201823-A totally prevented initial calcium influx and reduced later calcium influx by 50 +/- 2.5% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>/glycine stimulation (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> depolarization-induced calcium influx also was reduced by more than 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In rats, a single treatment with 10 mg/kg IV SB 201823-A beginning 30 minutes after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> decreased (P &lt; .05) hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by 30.4% and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 29.3% and reduced (P &lt; .05) forelimb deficits by 47.8% and hindlimb deficits by 36.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In mice, treatments with 10 mg/kg IP SB 201823-A beginning 30 minutes after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 41.5% (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No blood pressure effects were observed with the therapeutic dose of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the new neuronal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> SB 201823-A can block stimulated calcium influx into central neurons and can provide neuroprotection in two models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> without affecting blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data from several different studies now indicate that the neuronal calcium channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are a promising therapy for the postischemic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
