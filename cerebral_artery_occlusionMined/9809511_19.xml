<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat, the changes induced in neuronal and astrocytic metabolism and in the neuronal-astrocytic interactions were studied by combining in vivo injection of [1-13C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [1,2-13C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> with ex vivo <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC analysis of amino acids of the lateral caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex, representing the putative ischemic core, and the upper frontoparietal cortex, corresponding to the putative penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the putative ischemic core, evidence of compromised de novo <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> synthesis located specifically in the glutamatergic neurons was detected, and a larger proportion of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was derived from astrocytic glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same region, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase activity, representing the anaplerotic pathway in the brain and exclusively located in astrocytes, was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, astrocytic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake and conversion to glutamine took place, and cycling of intermediates in the astrocytic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the putative penumbra, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> synthesis was improved compared with the ischemic core, the difference appeared to be brought on by better neuronal de novo <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> synthesis, combined with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> formed from astrocytic glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both ischemic regions, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> synthesis directly from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced to about half, indicating impaired <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase activity; still, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> reuptake and cycling was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in the current study demonstrate that by combining in vivo injection of [1-13C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [1,2-13C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> with ex vivo <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, specific metabolic alterations in small regions within the rat brain suffering a focal ischemic lesion can be studied </plain></SENT>
