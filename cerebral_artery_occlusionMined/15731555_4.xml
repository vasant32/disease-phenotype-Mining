<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of PC on their expression after a long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> remains vague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have found various effects of PC on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of different cytokines after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor after 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) preceded by ischemic or chemical PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MCAo was induced in rats using the suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PC had been carried out 3 days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 experimental groups: MCAo alone; ischemic PC and MCAo; chemical PC and MCAo, and sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in the ipsi- and contralateral cortex was studied by semiquantitative RT-PCR at 12 and 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite clearly neuroprotective effects of both PC strategies, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of neurotrophic factors were similar in tolerant and nontolerant rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, 12 h after reperfusion, was lower when ischemic PC was applied prior to long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PC generally does not change the expression of neurotrophic factor expression after a long-term focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> compared to the nontolerant state </plain></SENT>
