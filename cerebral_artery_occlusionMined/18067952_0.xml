<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To determine the contribution of tissue factor (TF) to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury, we investigated the changes in TF in rat brains with transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and also assessed the effect of TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spontaneous hypertensive rats were subjected to 90-min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and then were reperfused for up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after MCAO, recombinant human TFPI (rhTFPI) (50 or 20 microg/kg/min) was administered by means of a continuous intravenous injection for 4.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TF immunoreactivity decreased or scattered in the ischemic area after reperfusion, however, an increased TF expression was observed in the microvasculature with the surrounding brain parenchyma and it peaked at 3 to 6 h, which coincided with the start of fibrin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, total TF protein in ischemic area continued to exist and did not remarkably change until 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after reperfusion, the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the group treated with 50 microg/kg/min rhTFPI was significantly smaller than that in the controls (saline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies showed that rhTFPI treatment resulted in a decrease of fibrin in the ischemic brains and microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF-mediated microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is thus considered to contribute to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The continuous infusion of rhTFPI until a peak of TF-mediated microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> therefore attenuates the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in the cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
