<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of this compound in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced cerebral injury following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere of the animals was interrupted by occluding the left cerebral artery and both carotid arteries simultaneously for 3 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These animals were assigned to one of ten groups and divided into treatment group and pretreatment group; 1) control treatment group (n=8); 2) vehicle treatment group (n=8); 3) lower dose mexiletine (400 microg/kg) treatment group (n=8); 4) medium dose mexiletine (800 microg/kg) treatment group (n=8); 5) high dose mexiletine (2 mg/kg) treatment group (n=8); 6) control pretreatment group (n=8); 7) vehicle pretreatment group (n=8); 8) lower dose mexiletine (400 microg/kg) pretreatment group (n=8); 9) medium dose mexiletine (800 microg/kg) pretreatment group (n=8); and 10) high dose mexiletine (2 mg/kg) pretreatment group (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was measured in serial brain sections stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue infarction volume and tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were estimated for each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly decreased in rats pretreated with mexiletine, and the ratio of tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was also decreased as the dose of mexiletine increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that mexiletine, an anti-arrhythmic and use-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> channel blocker, has protective effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection, as measured by the volume of infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> index in a model of focal, neocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
