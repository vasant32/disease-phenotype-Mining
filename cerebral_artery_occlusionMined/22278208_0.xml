<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Free radicals have been reported to play a role in the expansion of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, and the effect of free radical scavengers is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of Ocimum sanctum (OS) to reduce brain injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO for 2 h and reperfused for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of OS (200 mg/kg bwt., orally) once daily for 15 days before MCAO showed marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, reduced the neurological deficits, and suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly depleted activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in MCAO group were protected significantly in MCAO group pretreated with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the elevated level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances (TBARS) in MCAO group was attenuated significantly in OS-pretreated group when compared with MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, OS pretreatment may reduce the deterioration caused by free radicals, and thus may used to prevent subsequent behavioral, biochemical and histopathological changes that transpire during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding reflects that supplementation of OS intuitively by reasonable and understandable treatment effectively ameliorates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
