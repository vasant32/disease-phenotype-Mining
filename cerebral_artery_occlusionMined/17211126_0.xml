<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: ST(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), STES(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>+electrostimulation), SH(sham) and SHES (sham+electrostimulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ST and STES groups received a transient right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SH and SHES groups received a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The STES and SHES groups had daily isometric contraction training by electrostimulation(100 Hz, 45 mA, 7.5 V) on hindlimb muscles for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Plantaris and gastrocenmius muscle weight, myofibrillar protein contents of soleus and gastrocnemius, and the muscle fiber cross-sectional area of gastrocnemius in the ST group significantly decreased compared with the SH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius muscle weight, myofibrillar protein contents of soleus and gastrocnemius, and the Type I muscle fiber cross-sectional area of soleus and the Type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area of gastrocnemius in the STES group significantly increased compared with the ST group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hindlimb <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> occurs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and isometric contraction training by electrostimulation during early stages of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> of Type I and Type II muscles </plain></SENT>
