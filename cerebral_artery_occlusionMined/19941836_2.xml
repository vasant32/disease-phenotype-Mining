<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here investigated the expression of ES in ischemic brain and the consequence of cells expressing ES after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single dose of Ca-074ME, a membrane-permeable cathepsin B (CB) specific inhibitor, or vehicle was given by intraperitoneal injection immediately after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO), ES expression was evaluated using fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining, and CB enzyme activity was tested by measuring the free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51771">7-amino-4-methylcoumarin</z:chebi> (AMC) released by CB from its' specific substrate, the Z-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ES immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly up-regulated as early as 6 h and returned to baseline level at 3 days in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area following dMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double-staining experiment revealed that the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced ES positive cells were neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ES was co-labeled with CB and Cleaved Caspase-3(Asp175) whereas treatment with Ca-074ME reduced up-regulation of ES expression and attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data suggest that peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> neurons express ES during the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and treatment with Ca-074ME attenuates ES expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> neurons </plain></SENT>
