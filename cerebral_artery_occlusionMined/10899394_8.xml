<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their roles in neuronal survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the discovery of elevated nuclear levels of fos-related antigen-2 (FRA-2) in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons seven days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of FRA-2 and AP-1 DNA binding activity is elevated in hippocampi ipsilateral as well as contralateral to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Fluoro-Jade staining as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, FRA-2 was not found to be expressed in degenerating neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, FRA-2 is expressed in neurons that survive ischemic insult suggesting a role for this transcription factor in neuronal adaptation to the post-injury state </plain></SENT>
