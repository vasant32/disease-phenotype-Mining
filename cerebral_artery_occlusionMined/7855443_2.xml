<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were randomly and blindly assigned to one of three groups (six animals in each): (1) a control group that received equal volumes of physiological saline solution; (2) a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group that received a 5 mg/kg bolus of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1 h after occlusion, followed by 2 mg/kg per hour i.v. infusion for 5 h; (3) a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> group that received 0.2 g/kg twice with an interval of 10 min at 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was better in rabbits treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> than in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of ischemic to total neurons in the cortex was smaller in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group than in the control and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a statistically significance reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group compared with the other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was severe in the control and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> groups, but moderate in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+, and water content between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence for the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> on promoting neurological recovery and preserving the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
