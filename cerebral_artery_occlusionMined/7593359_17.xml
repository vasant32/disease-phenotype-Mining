<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this early postischemic period, male Wistar rats (n = 161) were subjected to right MCAO with closely spaced step variations in both duration of MCAO and blood pressure (BP), using the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative neuropathology was performed at 25 coronal planes of the brain after 1-week survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> was measured as the difference between the two hemispheres and was added to cortical and striatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> to obtain total tissue loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damage consistently increased monotonically with increasing duration of occlusion only when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was expressed as percentage of the contralateral hemisphere, but not when expressed as mm3, because of variable tissue size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that already at 1 week, the quantity of tissue loss due to resorption and transsynaptic effects approached the quantity of geographically traceable <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimum brain damage (5%) occurred after 60 min at a BP of 80 mm Hg, with almost no cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Damage was extremely sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and MCAO duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a BP of 40 mm Hg, 60 min of MCAO produced 25% damage, accelerating every 20 min during the 2-h period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At BP 80 mm Hg, 120 min of MCAO produced the same damage as only 80 min of MCAO at BP 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 60-, 80-, 100-, and 120-min duration of MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced with increasing BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
